I meant later... when you two took naps.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
How do you feel about that?
Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.
It's fucking freezing out here.
I'm talking about you.
Yeah, you.
What's weird about that?
Guess I'm not like most women.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
They're all assholes.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
You should buy several. I've got shitty light in my place, but my plants don't seem to mind. Light's important, but it's not everything.
Doesn't it get noisy?
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two.
They could eat you.
You're damaged.
So... what's your dark secret?
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
Are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex?
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
No you're not.
Do you?
Since you've had sex?
How about in the morning.
I thought I'd stay the night.
Well, Walter, this is going to sound off the wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck.
Is that all?
I sleep like a dead horse. Anything else?
Yeah.
Molested little girls?
It's not what you think.
Between ten and twelve. Once a nine year old told me she was eleven. Once a fourteen year old told me she was twelve. I always asked how old they were.
The judge had a thing about sex offenders. Later I heard his daughter had been raped. If I hadn't had a good lawyer, it would have been twenty five to thirty.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Depraved? My mistake.
Yes! I want to know.
I'm sorry, Walter.
My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave.
They seduce you?
You really believe that?
And what do you tell yourself now?
Bullshit.
Being here, with me.
Most people say the odds are against me.
The percentages
Why not tell me now?
All three in chronological order.
I love my brothers.
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
Are you serious?
Not ever.
Us seeing each other.
Neither am I.
Move in with me.
I've got problems.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
That's not what I meant.
Prove it.
Sneak up behind me like that.
Why's it always my fucking problem?
I need a shower.
Fucking liar.
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
Okay, good reason. Then what?
She went front office on you. Tighten that for me, right there. That's it.
I'm taking you back out.
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here. Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work. We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake. I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
My rig. I designed the damn thing.
You wimp. I had a lot riding on this. They bought you... more like least rented you cheap
Virgil, you wiener! You never could stand up to fight. You
Who else?
Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me.
Do you always have to call him that? The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick. His name is Michael.
What happened?
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
Fine. Be that way.
But you think it's something else. What? One of ours?
Whose then? Lindsey? Talk to me...
But what did he see that made him panic?
I don't know. I DON'T KNOW!
What about O 2?
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
I'm telling you what is there. You're just not hearing. The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan. There's something down there. Something not... us.
Look. I'm just trying to hold this situation together. I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
No.
We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
Not in this thing.
Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us. We better get this flooding stopped.
I don't know how!
I know! I know! But we better come up with something.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just
FUCK LOGIC!!
I drown, you tow me back to the rig
Hi, tough guy. I guess it worked, huh?
I've been better. Next time it's your turn, okay?
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around. It won't work. You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Yeah, well you never should have married her then.
Everything is.
Do we just leave him there?
It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
Meet me in the moonpool. Move fast.
All right. Do it!
Take the first watch in sonar. Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance. One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay?
Okay, here we go. Start equalizing, y'all.
Don't call me that, okay... I hate that. Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...
Wilhite, anything?
Copy that.
24 Trident missiles. Eight MIRVs per missile.
You're right... I don't. I just need to know that this thing is out of here! You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
1840... 50... 60... 70...
Let's go for it. We could get lucky.
Deep. It's classified... you know. Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
Then how come you're not with him?
A little more so this time.
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia aren't they already the same as being married?
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
I mean, to stay away longer two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
There you go... Must you always spoil everything!
If I had a man waiting for me for half an hour and whom I hadn't seen for a month...
I didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht. It lulls you...
Then why don't you try it on?
We'll send the raft back to you.
Oh, very well. I'll just spend the weekend alone by myself and take a little rest. I should be used to it by now.
But how could you say such a thing?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
You mean Sandro, don't you? Well, I beg of you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad.
Sounds like the name of a fish merluzzo, basiluzzo...
At the ruins. They're very ancient, you know.
Have you decided?
There's no comparison.
What were you and Anna arguing about?... Excuse me for being so indiscreet, but this is serious...
But of course... arrogant, haughty... Hasn't Anna ever told you?
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
I... I don't know... I didn't think it was worthwhile... She was laughing over it...
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
Then I'll go with you.
Yes, you should go.
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
Oh, Sandro...
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.
Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...
Does it please you to say such things?
Then why do you say them?
So, even if I did say them, I was sincere with her, as I am now with you.
Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs.
I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
That's why I asked you...
Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
No reason why...
Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
I'm too sleepy.
I love you.
I don't love you.
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
Have you ever been in love?
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
Do you consider that a compliment?
It means being without money.
Would you please see if Sandro is with him? He's not in his room. I'm sorry to disturb you.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have you noticed his eyes?
Who's moving?
But Corrado... If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
Giulia, that remark is not worthy of our twelve years of honest concubinage. I repeat, once and for all, and publicly, that I admire you. Does that please you?
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
We, too, you know. It was disastrous. First at Panarea, where there weren't any boats... then at Lipari, where everybody was asleep... And the phone call to Rome...
Well, we're still in Italy, you know!
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff... Maybe right here at Lisca.
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
I think it's possible.
Nothing, nothing at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
Yes, yes, of course.
You men are all so dreadful!
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
Why don't you try?
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
I appeal to you more?
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
I know, I know. One thing at a time.
Well... probably at the last stop, which is Noto.
Thank you.
But where did you come from?
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
And how come you're up so early?
But you have to consider all possibilities, Sandro.
I'll go and get my valise.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...
I know, dammit, I know! And just think if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations, degradations, infidelities... of... of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well, anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of laziness... of unwillingness.
I would like to ask you something.
No, I'm not. Why do you think she does all this? It's one of the many ways she can put herself on display. When you bait the trap, the mouse will snap. To tell you the truth, if it wasn't for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month's salary, well... But you had something you wanted to ask me?
Now listen, if I had any information, I wouldn't have come here to ask you. But I see that you, too, lack any information...
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
I just heard you.
Was it Sister Marguerite?
Let's talk about something else.
I don't know.
Yes.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Who?
Well, who in particular?
Uh huh.
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Who?
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Do you think he loves you?
He's told you?
You've been alone together?
Often?
And you like that?
Where do you meet?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
I don't know.
No. I was sick.
Something I ate.
Yes.
Down... there.
I went to my room.
I got sicker.
I fell asleep.
Yes.
What baby?
From their heads...
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
From God.
I... I don't understand.
Don't you know?
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
What do you mean?
Anything?
Are you married?
Would you like to be?
Do you have any children?
Would you like some?
Why not?
Why do you smoke?
No questions.
One.
Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes.
Why should I?
What else did she tell you?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
Like what?
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
You have trouble sleeping?
What things?
How did she know that?
Who?
Agnes...
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
Did your mother see angels often?
Do you?
Do you believe she really saw them?
Why not? Mmm?
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
Why not?
Why not?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
Like you?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
Is that what she said?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
What the child?
Agnes...
But you're troubled... aren't you?
And you're unhappy.
Agnes...
Sometimes, yes.
What did you do?
You can tell me.
She's dead isn't she?
She can't hurt you any more.
How?
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
Yes?
Yes?
She tells you you're ugly?
And that you're stupid?
That you're a mistake?
Why?
How does she know that?
Oh, yes.
What?
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
Please! I want to help you. Let me help you.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Are you pretty?
Agnes, you're stupid.
Are you intelligent?
You're a mistake.
I really love you.
As much as God loves you.
Who am I?
And why am I here?
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
What kind of trouble? What kind of trouble Agnes?
Of telling you.
I had a baby.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Did you want it to come out?
Why?
Why were you afraid?
To be a mother?
Why?
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
What made it grow? Do you know?
Would you like to tell me?
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Will she be angry?
Who? Who made you promise? It's alright Agnes. It's alright. Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
You don't like brussel sprouts?
Hm hmm.
Who?
Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby? Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night.
A crucifix.
A wastepaper basket.
No.
For me to get sick in.
Yes.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
I have to throw up...
Of what?
Why isn't anyone coming?
Is someone in the room with you?
Do you remember what just happened?
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember.
Yes.
So I could go to him.
Him.
She'd seen him too.
From the belltower the day she before she died.
Yes.
No...
Not your fault...
I hate him...
I hate him for what he did to me.
For what he made me go through.
I hate him.
I don't remember.
She took the baby in her arms?
You saw it all didn't you?
And then... what did she do? Agnes what did she do?
H... how?
Eve, she strangled a baby!
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Larry there's got to be something missing.
Something they... that they overlooked.
I don't know.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I'll have a decision by next week.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
I'll have it.
Next week.
No!
It's your favourite...
It's Martha, Mama. There you go.
I thought cherry vanilla was your favourite.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
Marie's dead Mama.
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
I... I'm Martha, Mama.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
What does this have to do with..?
Do you still go to church?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me.
Oh don't be so stroppy!
Nine.
Eight and two thirds.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous'cause you're old.
I bet you're sixteen!
Well
You heard, it gets on my wick.
I'm a deserter.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Yeah.
Oh, it's all right.
Yeah.
He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right'cos he's one of the gang.
Oh.
But I suppose we can survive a missed run through as long...
Oh now, they can't do that to me. It's all your fault. Oh yes it is and if they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the...
Sorry?
I see you go to the night court.
Well, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake out.
Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
Do I snore?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it. Can he read?
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.
Grotty?
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
I beg your pardon?
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
Get him out of here!!
Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
Yeah, she was fickle.
I don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?
Well, let's broaden our outlook.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
You haven't, you're just late. Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap. Hello, I've got one... oh, I think so... yes, he can talk... Well... I think you ought to see him. Of course, right away.
Oh aye, but I thought...
The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have'em, all I said was'aw go on, be big about it. '
Go away! You've spoilt it.
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Are you pulling my leg?
I see. Do you like the play?
Gear?
Thank you.
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
Aye, I knew you were.
Well, the way you were spouting, like.... " I don't believe you, sir... " and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
Oh aye, a sledge.
No... I wouldn't say that... just like an actress... you know.
They ought to be.
What are you?
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Of course... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber... Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it... Y'what?... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it... so there!!
Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want... well... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.
And what do you do about it?
Pity.
Yes.
Of course.
Clean though, isn't he?
I think you're soft or something.
That little old man.
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Oh, I see.
Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.
Well, I've got me gob stopper. Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.
What's old got to do with it?
Y'what?
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
No... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
No.
No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.
Come on, Shake, we'll leave'em to their penmanship.
Aye, well, now!
I would though.
You've got a midnight matinee.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
You're a swine. So hurry up... we're travelling!
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're...
Oh you are, I know you are.
You are.
Well, you look like him.
Oh you do, look.
And my nose...
Is it?
Aye, but you know him well.
That's what you tell me.
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
Thanks.
Temper! Temper!
I knew it, he started it, I should have known.
You two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.
You've lost him.
Aye, I suppose so.
No, we're not!
Do I have to raise me voice?
Well, you stick to that story, son.
Paul's grandfather.
Down the... er...
Yeah, down the... er...
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
What?
I know, that's the trouble.
He can't be far.
I'll set John on you!
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Well, he can't stop here.
I feel like shit...
I'm not kidding. You can get one if you have the credit. Look just like real cows, too.
Hell, no! We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock! It might be dangerous! What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Just short of Zeta II Reticuli. We haven't even reached the outer rim yet.
Gravity?
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust. Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise. Infrared noise. Let's try ultraviolet. There. Flat. It's totally flat. A plain.
It's... basalt. Rock.
Drop begins... now! Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing. Five. Three. Two. One kilometer and slowing. Lock tractor beams.
Martin, we're going in. I'm going to hold the conversation to a minimum from here on.
What's up?
I'm on my way.
Sure.
Can you see anything in the hole?
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
Don't you remember?
A transmission?
I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.
Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
Well, get started.
How's it coming on the engines?
Not they... he...
Why, what's wrong?
What do you mean?
You know what they make this stuff out of?
I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all.
Dead!
It's still in the ship?
Hurt! How?
And when will you be ready to do that?
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
The engines are fixed.
No, we can't afford to lose that much oxygen. We're going to have to flush it out.
Right.
You just sealed it off; it can't get to that section.
And be right back.
How does he breathe?
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it. At least right now it's keeping him alive.
Hell of a defense mechanism. You don't dare kill it.
Well, how does it feel to be rich men?
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know the spaceship and the pyramid. They're from different cultures and different races. That ship just landed here crashed like we did. The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
Maybe it wasn't always dead.
Maybe we can catch it.
He's running a fever.
Yes.
The machine will bring his temperature down. His vital functions are strong.
Got a better idea?
Thing is, I'm about out of fuel.
Does anybody know what happened?
How?
We can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely, once the lifeboat is in space.
Right. We've got a lot to accomplish. Let's get moving.
No... the risk is too great. Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
Can you get them back?
What do you mean, no?
But they don't know about the translation! They could be in danger right now.
Why, you chickenshit bastard
Three blips! They're coming this way!
It's some kind of organ it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
Well... I suppose that star shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard. Is that what you mean?
It's not going to work.
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
What's the frequency?
We should be almost on top of it. I just can't quite...
But what can we do? He's out of radio contact.
No, it's coming.
How the hell should I know? Come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there!
We're just plain lucky. That could have gone right through the hull taken weeks to patch it.
It appears to have healed itself.
Maybe we could write it together.
We've got about a week left, right?
That's the one about the albatross, right?
We came out there, we'll go back. A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use. Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall. I've seen it happen.
Come on let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear.
They're on the next level up.
Okay.
Could be some kind of venom, or poison...
They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs.
Let's hear it.
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Zero. Dry as a bone.
Not a one. It's dead.
Yeah, rock particles. Dust.
It appears to be some sort of spacecraft. We're going to approach it.
But?
Still worried?
I've always respected your opinion, Martin. If something worries you, it worries me.
But why draw it on the wall?
Thank Christ! We lost you! Listen, there's been a new development
Chaz what happened to Broussard?
We can't leave him out here, open the door.
Martin, this is an order! Open the door!
I can't lean on Faust any harder he's been working non stop on the engines.
With great pleasure.
That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him.
But if we haven't caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway.
Where are you?
We're coming!
Now what?
You win.
Nothing.
I know it looks like a senseless jumble, but if you look closely, there are recognizable forms.
No, I had to seal off a whole section. We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.
No such luck. I saw it running down one of the corridors.
That'll blow the ship up.
But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow.
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and
Look...
No... don't...
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Kill me...
Forget that. I want you off alcohol for at least seventy two hours. I've got some toxin build up tests still to run.
Do you want a tablet?
No, it's still breathing. Kinda clammy though. Are you sure your stick's not broken.
I told you we... what's that?
Good argument for gun control. What are you going after, rhino?
Yeah. Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.
It's on the board.
Cassie, thank Christ! We're under attack.
Quick! Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto shop maintenance pit.
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Yesterday. We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on'Sixty Seconds'. Biggest market crash since twenty four.
I lose'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock. Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
Can we move it to a different orbit in time?
Force the door.
Not yet.
Deal.
Ah, quit griping. Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.
Take a look at this.
That's a fact.
Just got a reading...
Forget it, man.
Fuck the bonus. I hate heights. You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night.
I'll come with you.
I'm picking up another signal.
I dunno. Might be a glitch.
Is it still moving?
One final point. Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself. However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay packet for whoever does.
Which mean physically going outside.
She was running a little sluggish on the way back. Think the turbines might be playing up.
Appreciate that.
Done it already. Nothing matches.
Punch me in a solution for their delta vee.
Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console. Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button...
Didn't feel like whoopin'it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
No, not really. More sort of the'claustrophobic'type.
Uh huh. Used to get it pretty bad. I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
Four.
Six month stint on Datus.
What is this?'Twenty Questions'?
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
Sure. Do me good to stretch my legs.
There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I. C. C.'ll throw a fit.
What do you mean?
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
You have to...
Tactical nukes, maybe?
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
' Bout five minutes.
You got it, cowboy.
We won't disturb her rest. It seems she left her award in the taxicab. Will you give it to her?
And what is your name?
Phoebe?
Why not? Tell me, Phoebe, do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
You're more than modest.
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them who will?
It needn't be.
I am somebody.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you
Perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo it started in San Francisco, didn't it? I say your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it the Shubert?
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake so sorry fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
Eddie what?
You take charge.
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of " Cora " and your hopes of playing it.
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
Do you know, Eve sometimes I think you keep things from me.
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now without any reason when I need you more than ever...
Just like it.
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
Aren't you?
You know me better than that.
Stars.
Plenty of time for a nice long nap we rehearsed most of last night...
Why not?
Did I say killer? I meant champion. I get my boxing terms mixed.
Some plain soda. Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
We're?
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember that it would bring me everything I wanted
I didn't mean just the Theater.
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America
And artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.
She doesn't know.
Was the setting properly romantic the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
You sat and talked until it was light...
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
It is possible even conceivable that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all yours.
Yes, you did. You still do.
Champion to champion.
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly and then get out so I can take my nap!
What do you mean by that?
What have you got to do with it?
I can't believe my ears...
Belong to you? That sound medieval something out of an old melodrama...
... taken it for granted? That you and I...
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
But the  500 you got to get out of town brought you straight to New York didn't it?
That's not true!
I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago. As always with women who want to find out things, she told more than she learned...... do you want to change your story about Lloyd beating at your door the other night?
And you realize you agree how completely you belong to me?
Take your nap, now. And good luck for tonight.
I don't think I'm going.
Because I don't want to.
No, it's not. It's for this.
Exactly. Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
I was there. An eyewitness.
A happy coincidence.
Margo? Lunching in public?
She may be later than you think...
I do not. How do you do?
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater
Then you two must have a long talk
The ladies'shall we say lounge?
It's good luck before an audition. She'll be all right once it starts.
The audition was called for 2: 30. It is now nearly four.
Naturally enough, your understudy.
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Didn't you know?
It just slipped your mind.
Just slipped your mind.
Was she that bad?
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
In time she'll be what you are.
Bill didn't say but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
To the best of my recollection, neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation.
Bill
This is Eve Harrington.
Right here. A minute ago.
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
Where's my coat?
Byron couldn't have said it more graciously... here we go
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding
I told her. I sounded off.
Bill...
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy
You're a setup for some gorgeous wide eyed young babe.
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
You're my girl, aren't you?
Then you're crazy.
I leave in a week the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can
You in a hurry?
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
Sure! Like the Western Union boys used to do...
Many happy returns of the day...
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
She did...?
Yeah... I will.
Okay.
I'll check with Eve...
I love you too. Good night, darling
This is my house, not a theater! In my house you're a guest, not a director!
Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
When I'm guest of honor?
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
So she seems.
I've always denied the legend that you were in'Our American Cousin'the night Lincoln was shot...
Of course it's funny this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this this age obsession of yours and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage struck kid
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
For instance what?
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you but I'm not going to. I'm too mad
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous on stage and off. I love you for some of them and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me or on Eve...
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
The kid junior, that is will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the shall we say, happier side?
The audition.
The kid. Junior.
I must have frightened her away.
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
I mix what I like.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
The ex ship news'reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
I will not calm down!
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt
Shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere gives a performance!
The playwright doesn't make the performance and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
Paranoiac!
Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with the rest of it...
It's time you found out. I love you. I love you. You're a beautiful and intelligent woman a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress at the peak of her career. You have every reason for happiness every reason, but due to some strange, uncontrollable, unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid kid like Eve to turn you into a hysterical, screaming harpy! Now once and for all, stop it!
Well, I am.
Don't be condescending.
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail like a salted peanut.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
It's not nonsense.
I wish it were.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
I I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
You were great.
Pass me the empty bottle. I may find her... why, look. There's Rasputin.
I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine...... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go.
You know why I forgive Eve? Because she's left good behind the four of us, together like this, it's Eve's fault I forgive her...
Yes, dear.
A cowboy.
With the paper to prove it.
Just wondered what?
Why what?
I don't have to. I want to.
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
The Theatuh, the Theatuh what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna? Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one man band all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make believe and an audience there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody you included, but not exclusively so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
And I shot my mouth off. Nothing personal, junior, no offense...... it's just that there's so much bushwah in this Ivory Green Room they call the Theatuh sometimes it gets up around my chin...
So few come back...
Every day.
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
After all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
What have I got to do with it?
The names I've been called. But never Svengali. Good luck.
You're always after truth on the stage. What about off?
Then face it. I have. Since that first night here in the dressing room.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you
And for you.
You think?
You hear all kinds of things.
Find out.
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint. It's only a fur coat...
A diamond collar, gold sleeves you know, picture people...
The same size?
Well. I guess a real tight girdle help when you're playin'a lunatic.
Miss Coonan...
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business
She's got two things to do carry clothes an'press'em wrong an'just let anybody else muscle in...
You don't like Eve, do you?
An answer.
Why not?
She works hard.
She's loyal and efficient
She thinks only for me...... doesn't she?
How do you mean that?
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call the William Morris Agency?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres Voila.
There was nothing he didn't know. There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
Late for what?
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
What are you doing here?
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off and then I guess, I fell asleep.
That's all.
You probably won't believe me.
It was for my report.
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear what kind of perfume and books things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs that they've got in most of the girls'high schools?
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward of course, they're just movie stars.
That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.
Don't bother.
How long does it take?
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week for weeks of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater
Not at all.
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
Bill Sampson? He's he's a director.
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance? But, don't you find it I mean apart from everything else don't you find it expensive?
She's got to meet you
You look just fine...... by the way. What's your name?
Well...
Not just that way. As a friend...
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Tell me, Eve how are things with you? Happy?
Karen...... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor after all you've already done.
Well... Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be, really not that I've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day when I heard Mr. Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her...
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll she plays.
No, dear. Margo must go on. As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
I think she would cheer.
They'll do as they're told.
You won't forget it?
I seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't I?
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
Please...
Nothing definite yet it's just to have lunch.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
Can't we sit down? Just for a minute...
Oh, but there is
Why shouldn't you? Please sit down.
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change and they become his words and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
You've really got a low opinion of me, haven't you? We'll I'll give you some pleasant news. I've been told off in no uncertain terms all over town. Miss Channing should be happy to hear that. To know how loyal her friends are how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be...
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out with the man from Hollywood?
But the raves about your performance
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else and don't underestimate him you have a powerful friend in Addison.
He can help you.
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot and then it's gone.
Give yourself time. Don't worry too much about what people think, you're very young and very talented...... and, believe it or not, if there's anything I can do
You want to play " Cora. " You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
You talk just as Addison said you did.
I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.
That won't be necessary. Addison knows how Margo happen to miss that performance how I happened to know she'd miss it in time to call him and notify every paper in town...... it's quite a story. Addison could make quite a thing of it imagine how snide and vicious he could get and still write nothing but the truth. I had a time persuading him...... you'd better sit down. You look a bit wobbly. If I play " Cora, " Addison will never tell what happened in or out of print. A simple exchange of favors. And I'm so happy I can do something for you at long last... Your friendship with Margo your deep, close friendship what would happen to it, do you think, if she knew the chap trick you'd played on her for my benefit? And you and Lloyd how long, even in the Theater, before people forgot what happened and trusted you again? No... it would be so much easier on everyone concerned, if I were to play " Cora. " And so much better theater, too...
I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
Let's get back to this one. Have you really seen every performance? Why? I'm curious...
Farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was a farmer. I had to help out. So I quit school and I went to Milwaukee. I became a secretary. In a brewery. When you're a secretary in a brewery it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. Everything is beer. It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home and there was a Little Theater Group... like a drop of rain in the desert. That's where I met Eddie. He was a radio technician. We played'Liliom'for three performances, I was awful then the war came, and we got married. Eddie was in the air force and they sent him to the South Pacific. You were with the O. W. I., weren't you Mr. Richards? That's what'Who's Who'says... well, with Eddie gone, my life went back to beer. Except for a letter a week. One week Eddie wrote he had a leave coming up. I'd saved my money and vacation time. I went to San Francisco to meet him. Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all. That Eddie was dead...... so I figured I'd stay in San Francisco. i was alone, but couldn't go back without Eddie. I found a job. And his insurance helped... and there were theaters in San Francisco. And one night Margo Channing came to play in'Remembrance'... and I went to see it. And well here I am...
Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards...
I won't be a minute.
Performance number one thousand of this one if I play it that long will take place in a well padded booby hatch...
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
The curtains. I made them myself.
No trouble at all.
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there are you sure you won't want it yourself?
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of?
I've got it.
Right here.
That's my job. See you at tea time...
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly wouldn't forget that. You'd never forgive me. As a matter of fact, I sent him a telegram myself...
Of course.
How are you making out in Mr. Fabian's office? I don't want you working the child too hard, Max just because you promised. As you see, I kept my promise, too...
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on
Ain't it the truth?
Autograph fiends! They're not people those little beast who run in packs like coyotes
They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even they're never indoors long enough!
She's just outside the door.
I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't you sit down?
Peace and quit is for libraries.
How far to the station?
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
Not many car either, not much chance of a lift...
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
I detest cheap sentiment.
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
So many people know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
And what is that? Besides something spelled out in light bulbs, I mean. Besides something called temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice... infants behave the way I do, you know. They carry on and misbehave they'd get drunk if they knew how when they can't have what they want. When they feel unwanted and insecure or unloved.
He's in love with you.
Why should he and why should you?
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common whether we like it or not being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings but you're not a woman...... slow curtain. The end.
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
It get better! " About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say younger actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity "
The little witch must have had Indians runners out snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up... well, she won't get away with it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it, I will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr. deWitt's ugly throat...
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
Very classy stuff, lots of technique
Easy, now...
If you'd only see her, you're her whole life you must have spotted her by now, she's always there...
Margo, again...
That's on time for Margo.
It's just possible she didn't...
Don't run out of adjectives, dear.
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
Incredible.
Don't joke about such things.
Eve.
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in you just missed her...
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone and didn't dare face Margo...
What with taxes coming up and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator well, I've been thinking...
If instead of waiting until next season to do'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with'Aged in Wood'we could put'Footsteps...'into production right away...
If we could cast it properly, that is...
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
No, I got the idea myself while she was talking to me...
For once, to write something and have it realized completely. For once, not to compromise
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious!
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
I'm glad Bill's back.
You for one. I told her you were set on Margo playing the part and I certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval.
And for my feelings in particular! For my play, my career and now for a frightened, hysterical girl on the eve of her first night in the Theater!
Then tell me this isn't true! That your concern for your play and career is one thing and that poor frightened hysterical girl another and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career!
Within your time, buster. Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts. Write me one about a nice, normal woman who shoots her husband.
Up in the room.
Shucks. And my autograph book is at the cleaners.
When you do, let me in on it.
" Cora. " She's still a girl of twenty?
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
Don't be evasive.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
Spoken like an author. Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh. That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago
I'm sure.
To you, too?
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty four year old character played by twenty four year old actress...
It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them!
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
I never said it was!
It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto!
It's not important whether you do. We are wearing long underwear.
Thank you, Lloyd. Godspeed.
She is a louse.
I don't think I could be.
It means I've finally got a life to live! I don't have to play parts I'm too old for just because I've got nothing to do with my nights! I know you've made plans. I'll make it up to you, believe me. I'll tour a year with this one, anything only you do understand don't you, Lloyd?
Play it again.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
" Liebestraum. "
My dear Horowitz. In the first place, I'm paying you union scale. Second, it's my piano. Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. " Liebestraum. "
Miss Caswell? What?
When's the audition?
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
Anything to help you out, Max.
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would
Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
She'd be a great help read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure
Think of your health, Max more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
Promise.
That's my Max.
Are you breaking the contract?
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
I said I'm a dying man!
It was fine the way it was
I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?
And you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau
Bradlee went to Harvard
I'm smart enough to know my story was solid
No way
Fuck you, Carl.
Forget it, the main thing did you call me a failure?
I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention. The Times has got to be full of it it can't be crazy Cubans.
Right. Nixon didn't get where he got by being dumb listen, that was a Watergate question
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
Maybe a political operative of some sort
It makes sense; Hunt worked for the C. I. A. and the White House was paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.
And you haven't called him?
I'm trying
Fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company
And? And?
Were you eyebrow reading?
My first day as a copy boy I was sixteen and wearing my only grown up suit it was cream colored. At 2: 30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says, " My God, haven't you washed the carbon paper yet? If it's not washed by three, it'll never by dry for tomorrow. " And I said, " Am I supposed to do that? " and he said, " Absolutely, it's crucial. " So I run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the men's room. I'm standing there washing it and it's splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak, and he says, " What the fuck do you think you're doing? " And I said, " It's 2: 30. I'm washing the carbon paper. " Just wanted you to know I've done dumber things than get us lost, that's all.
It's not us, they were scared before we got there. What do we know?
Anything you've got.
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
We appreciate your position really.
Who'd you vote for?
' 68.
We've got to find out who the five guys are the five with access to the slush fund they were aware of the break in.
It goes very high we've got to find out where
She was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding might surprise him if you're not.
And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
Just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway
We gotta top the Times
If we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again
I know a lawyer at Justice
Almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card carrying Democrat.
For the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break in.
Because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self destructed.
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
We're working on the last guy now and we're going all the way that fifth man was Haldeman.
Haldeman.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
What's the matter?
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury.
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
Jeeeeeeesus
Jeeeeeeesus
Jeeeeeeesus
Jeeeeeeeeesus
All that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
What time is it?
Morning or night?
Oh.
I'm on deadline.
The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy
Sure. I remember seeing a book about Chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the White House Library and the Library of Congress and
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
Good. Just tell him I was here, that I'm sorry I missed him
Mind if I try?
Listen we know you're involved in this we're going to get the story, why not help?
By " they " you mean...?
When did he hire you?
Tell that to Muskie.
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
You wrote the Canuck letter the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
But you know who did.
Sure off the record.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him everybody's frightened of him Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
Can't help you.
I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.
" I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Toronto. " That was your spiel then. " The Lifestyles of Deserters. " I'm still waiting for it.
It makes the break in real it's a major goddamn story I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it don't forget that I hate it
What about you?
Oh, they're here. I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah. See?
Five hundred; six maybe.
I think.
It's right under that pile.
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
You don't really think you're being followed?
FBI too?
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
Hey, easy...
So tell me about the Times article.
No games, Irwin; give.
Something maybe big.
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
Who by?
Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this you know that, don't you?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
We were never told flat out " Don't talk. " But the message was clear.
Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth.
Kalmbach Nixon's personal lawyer.
My wife just had the baby, my in laws are arriving, I'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape.
You asking me to disclose my source?
Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not?
What do you think?
OK.
You have nothing more to say, I understand that.
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel they never even made a phone call. So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come?
Your clients were arrested with a walkie talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.
I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once I have nothing more to say.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
You don't mind getting on people's nerves, do you?
She's an awfully good reporter I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant
The twenty five thousand dollar one. The one with your name on it. In Bernard Barker's Florida account. Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar
Yes, sir.
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
Will you step forward, sir.
Where?
Where in government?
Where?
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly. Except it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters and these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2: 30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying a walkie talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices. Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
Two o'clock, work the phones'til you go.
Don't know; who the hell's Howard Hunt? It's probably nothing but check it out. Just go easy, it could be crazy Cubans.
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing. "... This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it. "
As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
I can't sell hints to Simons you called everyone you know? Call someone you don't know.
Who's Colson, Harry?
Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, " When you've got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow. "
I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
In other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
Let me see what you get, but don't jump The New York Times thinks it's crazy Cubans.
Howard
That was awhile ago.
I know, I did, but damnit Howard For the first time since I've known him, I think he's really humping...
Maybe I'm tense
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
He just did.
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans'safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five.
I won't talk about the other two.
Badly. You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.
This is no imitation. Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog. Behold Ultradog, no dog.
I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance. When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
What are we gonna hear?
Just go!
You're gonna shit your pants!
Finch, listen Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash chino or whatever. It's fast acting. I mean really fast.
Yeah... so... you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Okay. I mean, I agree, but... aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
I just realized that I didn't know anything about you. I was interested.
Do I have to?
What's your middle name?
Come on! I won't tell.
Okay. So I had this... thought, and... this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone
You don't like it?
What? No I'm not.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Yeah? Well you can't fake your way through this. You better practice.
Stifler told me.
Well... I needed to find you. We are gonna have to practice that song.
Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar. If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.
So you're going to Michigan?
Onions?
You want onions?
Well, State's got a good business school. And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team. Green peppers?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player? I really have no idea.
Well, you're not. Oil and vinegar?
I know. Salt and pepper?
... yeah.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced. I just... I didn't realize it...
Alright... yeah... thanks for understanding. So I guess... I'll see you later.
You're missing the game for us?!
It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.
This isn't any better, Chris.
Well, that's what your friends call you. I mean... I feel like I'm one of your friends now... and also... your girlfriend.
What? We both have cars.
That's not why we're going out.
Jessica! He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready. It's got to be completely perfect. I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Please.
I think I've had one.
... I've never tried it.
I'll give you a hint. " Ohhh, yeah, yeah! " Comprende?
You got it, stud.
No you haven't.
No.
Do you?
Do you love her?
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica. If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
Thanks. It was my idea.
Are you kidding? No.
Well... I guess it's okay for me to tell you now. That reputation of his isn't going anywhere. Finch comes to me and says, " Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera. " So I told him, pay me two hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed. So he did, and I did.
Duh. Of course. Naturally, I embellished a little bit. Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
You think she was serious?
It's all good. Breath check.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable. But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Exactly three weeks to the day.
Yeah, enormous.
I don't get it. How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
I'll save you a seat.
That's stupid.
Oh... oh... oh, shit!
Oz, how about you and Heather? Now you guys are a couple or something?
You're not... busy?
Yes dad.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Yes.
Dad!!
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
What was your name again?
Okay. Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Yes. Seriously.
Whatever you want.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Okay. You want a story? Here's a story. Stifler finds this beer, right? And...
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
Okay, I get it.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I
Oh yeah! Put it in your mouth!
She's a mermaid, dude.
She's a cartoon, dude.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
I know.
After high school.
Indeed. Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
I suppose that would be okay.
Shame on you!
Well. You have seen me. Now it is my turn to see you. Strip.
Yes, slowly.
Um... okay...
Can't what? Do you not want to be with me? I wish to be entertained, James.
Oh yes. Very arousing women. They arouse me very much. But not as arousing as you.
No! I've got... reserve reserves!
Check out time! Please vacate the room.
Me? Nothing. I'm the one whose ass he kicked. I'll tell you one thing, though. I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
You got in.
Tonight?
Yes! I'm a shithead! I'm a complete and total shithead!
That's my trick!
Indeed I did. But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot. It's time for us to... express ourselves in new ways.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Yes
But you don't love me.
Okay.
It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.
Kevin... I want to have sex with you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay. Did you bring a condom?
Like, normal style. The... missionary position.
Okay.
It did.
No, Kevin That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing. That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
What?
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic. This was before the cheesy remake.
That's the spirit.
I know, but think about it At the parties that night. Chicks are gonna want to do it.
That junior chick?
Yeah right. I got an idea for something new. How'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin'use'em.
Bullshit. From where?
Hah! Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at her store.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Stifler, fuck... man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week. If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.
Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?
The key is don't look down.
Would you shut up?
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha. I think maybe I drank too much.
I don't know... Surprise me.
Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
Uh huh. Good for you.
Like an underground club?
And who's Claude?
So... you feel okay now?
I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower!
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard. Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
I don't... I... I can't remember...
What?! He told you? When?
I don't know...
I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want?
You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
It's making me hungry.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Right.
No... I...
Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did. Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Before the coma!
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
That's not all... Marcel Officer Boulard was following you.
I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.
My men think you died and floated away in the Seine. If I wanted to, I could let them believe that. But that would be illegal...
The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
What?
Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
Terrence and I came down here to do serious work. For centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate.
Uncle Terrence.
Because Gaston was after it.
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Claude.
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his " hippie brother ". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and Is he... is he going to die?
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
What do you mean, maniacs?
Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin'chain saws.
Andy, it's not so easy. There are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under Paris. It's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... It's no man's land.
Why would he pick this one?
Not that I know.
What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh?
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive? Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Are you crazy? We have nothing. Let him go, then watch him. If you're right, you can pick him up at midnight. Or maybe he'll lead you to the others. Just let him go.
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite " intense ". So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. " The great cure for lycanthropy! " Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if I would be just as shocked! Ha.
Hmmph. At least now there's one person around here who doesn't think I'm crazy.
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
What were you showing her?
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
Good day!
Ah... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress... your grandmother, I mean.
You'll laugh.
Not you. Him.
Poor Meetoo!
Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore I know how much you needed the money.
No. From now on I am your loyal subject... your highness. By your leave?
That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy.
I don't know I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution...
I don't know. I don't see what this has to do with me.
Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris. We're going to bring Anastasia to her in Paris.
I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
HUH?!
The dessert fork!
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
I know I must have had something to do with the palace I've had little flashes of things but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
I'm sorry.
You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful... even if you forget a couple dates of family names she'll know.
No! Well, yes, but
No, no child... shush... it's all right...
No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia do you understand the choice you must make.
" If " I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
And this is my future. This is who I am!
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
And what do you want, my little rat with wings?
Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is... still alive.
Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which is natural... Of course my second cousin Treplev he never grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute...
My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said " Curses were made to be broken ". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...
Evil, powerful beings I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well...
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
Look!
What a world a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant'Your Highness ".
Are you feeling all right?
Dmitri... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
I know, I know... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs it was the...
Please, if you'd just listen...
I want you to have the reward money you've earned it.
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you? Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
She does.
Oh, Dmitri. I wish that I could.
I had nothing to do with it!
I did no such thing!
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
Perhaps you could convince her?

Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Me, no. You... I I you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.

Listen to this so I know there's this big tall blond crew cutted guy and he's lookin'at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, " Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner. " Wagner, Max, Wagner so I know what he's really tryin'to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Ah.
Forget it, Max.
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left. Right?
Max, the city is terribly worried.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti Semitism.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's there's ritual, religious cult murders, you know, there's wheat germ killers out here.
Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs.
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
Well, sit down.
You all right?
You wanna lie down?
How about a ginger ale?
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
What difference does that make?
Where?
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
There are no twos, Max.
M'hm.
How do you like this couple, Max?
Hi. How do you do.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
Yes, I do.
We're going to take them to the airport.
Well, hi!
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
No, no, no, not at all.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
And we could just sit and talk... nothing. Uh, not a big deal, it's just relax, just be very mellow.
Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get together and... and we'll meet there.
Oh, gosh.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
There's a whole wing in this house.
You can have it to use. Why why are you smiling?
Yeah.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
And here, you just
Uh, how did this personality come about?
There were many men interested in you?
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Did you know the contractor?
Was it a contractor?
To code?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
I hate the sight of blood. You guys don't take prisoners.
Anouk isn't like a dog, really. More like a small person. So is there anyone here for me? No one looks new. Who's that?
Oh I think he's cute. How's the marriage part working out?
Like you didn't know. Who invited the bimbo?
Had a little help?
It has your ring.
She's a constant surprise.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and... The wisdom. She's an old soul. She knew that Shostakovich thing. Did you notice?
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits. i can't wait to work with her.
With great tits. I'm going to ask her if I can touch them.
The movie.
I don't know what's going on. I don't care to guess. Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all. She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script. She can barely get the lines out. There was a scene last week she sobbed, through every take. I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe. Something's gone. You know, that thing that was Sally that always surprised you. It's gone. I think she's scared. And that's death.
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe. He's a woman's director. And nothing's happening. Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed. He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
Hey, listen, I love her. She's Sophia's best friend. I never said any of this, alright. I'll deny it on the stand... You guys are gonna have kids. That is so great. Maybe that's what this is all about. Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore. You know adults don't do this for a living. You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing one asshole in the family is enough. Sophia knew that intuitively. Look at Clair. Clair's a mess. Make sure she gets the epidural. Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be. " Life is but a walking shadow. A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more... " And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
Any thoughts on casting yet?
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel... when are you shooting?
I have a small window of time.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
You've got a lot of fucking gall. Thirty nine.
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
It's always not this time. If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone.
Or I won't. I can't help her. I'm out of my depth.
I don't know how to make her funny.
What what's about?
Why didn't you bring him?
Oh.
Oh.
Well, probably.
Oh.
I'll change back before we leave.
I'm fine. I'm fine. Well, I'm a little stressed. And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy. I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
I'd love a Xanex. Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
You know Sophia. She's so damned judgemental. And she's so damned... perfect. And so fucking... serene. Just fucking don't tell her. Because you know Mac thinks she's God. And I can feel him comparing.
Just don't fucking tell her.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Never.
Not for a second. Cal can have all that.
So where is young Jonah?
You should have brought him.
Oh. Do you have any pictures?
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
Jesus, Sally. I'm not the enemy.
It's not a contest.
I never put myself in harm's way.
No, not anymore. Happy anniversary, scout.
Can I open it?
Please?
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Just did. Jealous?
Oh, very jealous.
In Cheyene Walk? Lucy's going to have a meltdown. Oh, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
And?
But she's alright.
Fuck you.
I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag. You just need to get into a car and go.
And you know our friends, how?
Oh. You're them.
We've heard lots about you.
Well it's fucking time.
Are you my big hard hero?
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah?
Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.
Damn near. And a damn near perfect drug.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Hm. Do you like fucking out of doors?
They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns!
It was fifteen seconds.
Are you always this much fun?
Hey. Thanks, buddy.
Yeah, thanks pal.
So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what?
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning. The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
You only made half your quote this year.
I worry because you don't. It's my job. I'm feeling guilty. I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
Whatever you say. Listen, I love you.
They're paying him scale.
We'll be fine.
The Roses? And of course they said yes.
Whatever you say.
Yes.
Scout's honor.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Ryan's novel?
Accept a compliment.
Not.
I missed all of you. We're okay, aren't we?
I mean, you're really back.
What?
Okay. I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you. It was the only chance I had to meet her.
She goes on location tomorrow. Sally, I'm sorry. Look, I can't keep her on hold.
You want me to uninvite her?
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Okay, knock it off.
Truce.
I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake.
She left the fucking gate open.
Can't have gone far? He's like a greyhound. He could be miles away.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
Otis, good boy, come here. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
It was done. When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door. It was done.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it. But I guess that's what I interrupted.
Yeah, let's talk about that. You seem to be rather an expert. I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
What else don't I know about, Joe? Let's get really clear here.
Otis! Come! Good boy! Come!
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
You walked out on a five year marriage.
It's not like this all the time.
And how hard it hit?
You've been through it. That's how you love people. When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
You want to talk about bullshit? Lucy called you three times this week. She's a fucking mess, Joe. Your sister is a fucking mess. She needs you. I talk to her more than you do.
It is true. You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
Right. And when was the last time you spoke to her?
About me!
What are you saying?
I don't look my age, Joe.
It's a shit novel anyway.
Not really. I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch. That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Who? Who? Who thinks that?
Mac? Mac says it? Cal?
Anyone else?
Don't.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
I told you when we met I never wanted children. I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it. You weren't listening.
I wanted you back.
I'm a monster. Exactly.
Don't make allowances. I'll never be ready. Some people just shouldn't have children. I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe. I did want it for us. But I couldn't do it. I don't really think I can do it.
Yes.
I know.
I don't want to go tonight.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
Life gets messy. Ugly messy. But I don't understand you. And I don't think I ever understood Lucy. I don't understand throwing it away. How do you throw all that away? Any of it. I want it all. You guys want guarantees? I want the possibilities. And all kinds of crap comes with that. A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff. All the good shit. All the surprises. It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it. We'd have had amazing children, you and me. We'd have had a ride. You'd have surprised yourself. I'll never love anybody else, you know.
That's under lock and key.
I know.
I know. It's for the baby's crib.
Sure.
Has she called?
I'll do it.
Lovely.
Oh. Well. Good.
The novel. No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Yes, she is.
It's a novel.
Yes.
No.
Yes I did.
Don't I find what?
Not long.
Joking.
Do I put you off?
And I you.
Ah.
Mmm hmmm.
Ours.
And you got Skye Davidson. Pretty big leagues for a first timer. Do you even like movies?
Kind of. Hey, look John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji they're friends. And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy. Anything I can do.
I meant Sally.
No. No. Let me tell you something. Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood. The sleep depravation alone.
Sally did all this herself?
Mmm. It says something about the two of you maybe.
Oh, yes. You know Ryan's been sober eight years. And it's difficult if I... you know. It's better if I don't.
I'm a little nervous, so...
A little out of my element.
Well, yes. Yes, in fact. A little on the outside, yes. And there's been all this friction.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
But you're very private people. You know, there's a kind of elitism...
The wrong word, maybe. Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
And Ryan works at home.
Oh shit. I'm sorry. I'm a total fucking maniac. Delete all that, okay? I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife. Oh shit. I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis. Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon. We hear dogs barking at night, too. And it's not Otis.
Scout's honor.
Sally!!!!
Let's go for a walk.
I'm a little in the puke zone.
What am I, five?
Okay.
Lemon it is.
It's really not the same thing. He was really nicer when he drank.
Eight years, though. That's quite an accomplishment.
Medallions.
Yes.
He has to find non smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
Nine... nine, yes? Nine years, just about.
Oh yes. Nineteen... just. I'm cold.
I'm so glad. You know, I recognize that passage in your book. The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair. But the moment was exactly the same. The same, you know, dynamic. And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
It was a mistake. This isn't a plot to do in Otis.
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
I'm so happy you like it. I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
I think you should then. You should look in on Sheila.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan. But I think you're really nice people...
I don't need a drug.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around. Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?
All the ugly phone calls? We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan. They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH.
What?
Yes. And you've met Joe.
Thank you. I understand you're an interior decorator.
I so wish I'd known.
I did it.
I'm so sorry.
I...
Oh my god. I've been so rude. I'm Skye Davidson. Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
Do you need anything else?
The charades.
That was my clue.
The Shostakovich.
Oh yes, indeed. That was my clue, you see.
Andre Zhdanov? How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Otis you crazy dog! Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon? My people are very hungry.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Would you, like, marry him?
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty two?
Are you lovesick?
Will champagne help?
She's all over him, are you blind?
How?
Fuck you, Panes.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
Exactly what I mean. It's all ruined.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Like the last time.
Like the last time.
Okay.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
We're just feeling our way back.
You know it's true.
Shit. It's my Galiano.
About five thousand dollars. With my discount.
No. Really. For real. Really.
You're a shit.
That's it? Yes. Fine?
Why not?
Alright. Well, that's something new.
Well, something's wrong.
Um. Happy for you.
So tell me, how's it going?
You're my best friend.
Yes, you're a monster.
We're going to have to go back out there.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Absolutely. You always wonder where your books end up. Why don't we use it?
Relax. You've done enough.
And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over. Because you're both, so, what introspective? And you should have done it ages ago. I'm Sophia Gold. Come meet my husband, Cal.
Like Joe.
In the guest room. I've laid out a paint table for them.
Nevermind.
She's such a great photographer.
So where should I put it?
It's much more personal in here.
We're always in here. She really gets him, doesn't she?
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she? She's a genius.
Big time.
I trust you.
You'll hate it in London. It's wet and miserable. A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized. Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen. Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit. There's no excuse for pain like that.
Well good. Thank God.
Oh honey, let's.
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time. Don't I? I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted. And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids. Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
Hey, let's sit down. I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
Cal knows who he is. Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
I don't have a drug problem.
His sister does. Big time. And the New York Times says addiction is genetic I'll e mail you the article.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
Ha! Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
No you are not. You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash. You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man child. " Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director... " English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway.
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
Thank goodness. Breaktime.
Who cares, Z. All I know is, we gotta dig. We're not the ones in charge.
Tell me about it.
Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...
Are you asking me out to dinner?
I'll make myself available... Listen, better watch out with the backtalk. I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me. I'm afraid he got... downsized.
No an individual!
Oh... and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now. I miss him already.
Because... because he's twice the ant that you are. I could never go through with marrying you. I'm I'm an individual, and when I get married, it'll be to someone I choose.
The palace, hunh? I bet those royals really live it up. Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding
Really?
You're right!
Why can't I just do whatever I want to do? Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
Let me think. Hmmnn... Never. Bye!
Ah, yes. Well, charmed, I'm sure. So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
Oh... oh well then, one more won't matter.
No weirdly... You remind me of someone...
OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU! YOU'RE A WORKER!!! A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!
That's not what you said the other night
At the worker bar! You were pretty hot to trot then!
I order you to find out where we are!
How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
Look around, sweetheart.
Ha! Don't make me laugh. You're crazy about me! That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
I was slumming it! I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
I didn't choose him. What kind of idiot would...... choose who she wanted to marry?
Insectopia? You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Worker! Come back here now!
That's not a name! That's just a letter!
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking... I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Wait, I hear something!
Listen, " Princess ", you can't order me around. Out here, you're not the boss anymore out here, you're just
Stop fooling around in there.
Look. How many other Princesses are there?
And only you can become a Queen?
So what makes you so special?
What difference does it make... we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...
Let's dig in!
This is all your fault!!!
Well, " trouble " is my middle name. Actually, my middle name is. 985, but I don't tell people. Hey, Bala, I... I actually have something of yours... you left it at the bar that night.
Well, I... I know it's a little strange, but... I thought it might come in handy if I... needed a scarf someday. Well, to be honest, I just liked having it.
Yes but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings. The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged. Even marriage. You're lucky General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Trial membership? Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
No we're going to attack the termites!
No, no, you're... lookin'good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Hang in there, buddy! You can make it! Just take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body it's gotta be around here somewhere!
Barbatus, hang on Barbatus!!
No one should have to. Have him brought to me.
Desperate times call for desperate measures. Get me Ant Team Six.
Well now you haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Good. You're a good soldier.
Okay, son.
Not that one. Or that one.
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Royal victory party? Will... will Princess Bala be there?
ONE TO NOTHING!
Well she better she's engaged to one. Me!
Affirmative.
In love? I'm just a plain old soldier at heart. I'll tell you what I love the field blood death orders... and the company of other warriors.
... Not enough food?
Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting. Good luck with the hallucinations.
ARREST HIM!
Yes, what else?
Yes, General Formica. Carry on, my good man! I don't know what we would do without you.
I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess. In the meanwhile
' Fraid not, your majesty. Goodbye, your majesty.
Alright, let's move out!
Come on everybody dumps on us workers. You soldiers get all the glory. Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
I can't help it. I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature. Call me crazy.
Of course. You were born two seconds after me.
Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.
Well, you just sit here and be a party pooper.
It's a sign that you're crazy! Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
Well I'm gonna start doing things for you...
You bet! They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Yeah, I know.
Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there. And come right back after the inspection!
That's sweet. That's real sweet.
Don't worry about the old lady. One squawk from her, and she's out of a job.
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
I've been here twice as long as you have
It's a bet.
I sort of like it.
Oh, I never catch colds.
That makes me feel just terrible.
Well, to make the figures come out even since I have no colds a year some poor slob must have five colds a year.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy. You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude the blood rushes to their head, or something boy, I could tell you stories
Fine. Wait.
How'd you make out on the twenty seventh floor?
No.
Sure.
You mean tonight?
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
No. Like a man.
This date is it just a date or is it something serious?
Well, in that case, couldn't you?
Oh, I understand.
Eight thirty.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic 44th Street.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village it's practically around the corner from where you live.
Oh, I even know who you live with your sister and brother in law I know when you were born and where I know all sorts of things about you.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
I know your height, your weight and your Social Security number you had mumps, you had measles, and you had your appendix out.
What gave you that idea?
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night
I forgive you.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency wise and otherwise wise. Cheers.
You're so right.
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
Three.
Why don't we step into any office? There's something I want your advice about, anyway. I have my own office now, naturally. And you may be interested to know I'm the second youngest executive in the company the only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board.
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side is that better?
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me how about the three of us going out this evening you and me and the bowler stroll down Fifth Avenue sort of break it in
I understand. Christmas family and all that
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
He and I are like this. Sent me a Christmas card. See?
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling you sure this is the right way to wear it?
You don't think it's tilted a little too much
I know. I like it this way makes me look the way I feel.
All right. Have a nice Christmas.
That's right. I told you we had a fight that's what it was about Miss Olsen you know that other girl you saw
It's not important, Fran the main thing is that I got here in time and you're going to be all right isn't she, Doc?
I didn't know I had no idea this was your apartment
My head it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
Where's my dress? I have to go home.
Sure I do. It's always nice to have company for Christmas.
Oh of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.
I'll fix you some coffee.
Wait a minute let's talk this over first. Just what are you going to tell her?
You better figure it out exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
Who?
And where are you now?
His apartment?
What's your friend's name?
What's her first name?
Something wrong with your legs?
Your stomach?
Miss Kubelik, I don't think you ought to call anybody not till that chewing gum is out of your head.
Thanks for reminding me.
Oh, you're wrong. He told me
Oh. Did you find something here an envelope?
Open it.
Sure.
I am. Let me get the cards.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
I don't want it.
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
I was fifteen we used to go there to smoke. His name was George he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Cut.
Too slow?
You better win a hand you're on a blitz.
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
I'm sure that's the explanation.
No doubt about it.
What for?
You are?
Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Do I have to?
Gin.
Would you mind opening the window?
It's only one story down the best you can do is break a leg.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
I would.
Yeah. Well that's the way it crumbles, cookie wise. Go to sleep.
Mr. Sheldrake.
I think you should. I have to run down to the grocery anyway all that's left around here is one frozen pizza I'll be right back okay?
Gas. Didn't you turn it on?
You turned it on but you didn't light it.
In this house, you're supposed to.
Thank you.
Well, things are a little disorganized around here.
Yes, you are, When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
I know so. He's a taker.
Some people take, some people get took and they know they're getting took and there's nothing they can do about it.
I really ought to be getting home. My family will be flipping by now.
Well, maybe not exactly I tried to do it with a gun.
Worse than that she was the wife of my best friend and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty five automatic and drove up to Eden Park do you know Cincinnati?
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy I mean, how do you do it? here, or here, or here you know where I finally shot myself?
Here.
Uh huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off pow!
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
Of course not. Here's the fruit cake. And you want to see my knee?
Yes, nurse.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como the other night I had dinner with Mae West of course, she was much younger then. Cheers.
I mean, after that?
You don't have to if you don't want to
We're going to finish that gin game.
So I want you to keep a clear head.
Fine.
I know. I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake?
I never thought he'd do it.
I guess so.
Yes. You walking to the subway?
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce wise.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
Mind if I come in?
In there.
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office without overtime.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
Think.
You do?
The Vice Squad?
What what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
Sir?
Who?
Oh.
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain
Well, about six months ago I was going to night school, taking this course in Advanced Accounting and one of the guys in our department he lives in Jersey he was going to a banquet at the Biltmore his wife was meeting him in town, and he needed someplace to change into a tuxedo so I gave him the key and word must have gotten around because the next thing I knew, all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets and when you give the key to one guy, you can't say no to another and the whole thing got out of hand pardon me.
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel no matter how large the barrel you realize that if this ever leaked out
How do you work it with the key?
I'm not through with you yet.
The reason I called is I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me'bye, darling. Tell me something, Baxter have you seen Music Man?
How would you like to go tonight?
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter I want to swap them.
I am?
Thank you, sir.
You know how people talk.
Not that I have anything to hide.
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
Don't thank me thank your friends here they're the ones who recommended you.
Well I guess so.
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she the lucky one?
Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.
Oh, yes. Thanks.
So it was. She threw it at me.
You know how it is sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
You see a girl a couple of times a week just for laughs and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you is that fair?
Yeah. You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor all the dames you want no headaches, no complications
Put me down for Thursday again.
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
What?
Yes, sir I understand. She left a note you want me to open it and read it to you? Well, it was just a suggestion no, you don't have to worry about that, Mr. Sheldrake I kept your name out of it so there'll be no trouble, police wise or newspaper wise
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you a hundred dollars
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her
Sir?
You're going to take her off my hands?
You left your wife?
Yeah
It's about Miss Kubelik she's all right again so she went back home.
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place. What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out then it takes six weeks in Reno meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while. Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room
Oh?
Yes, sir.
Naturally.
I see.
Don't mind what?
Very clever.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
No key!
I dig.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Now hold on, Baxter
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking but it's not as bad as it looks MATUSCHKA It's none of my business what you do, Fran you're over twenty one but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
Look, Buddy boy if there wasn't a lady present, I'd clobber you.
Fran been sick or something?
Who else?
I don't mind in the summer but on a rainy night and I haven't had any dinner yet
Mr. Sheldrake?
You're on your way up, Buddy boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth and put my name on it.
I'll pay you on Friday. And whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?
Yes, sir. They are indeed.
I'm a pretty good operator myself but she just won't give me a tumble date wise.
A lot of guys around here have tried it all kinds of approaches no dice. What is she trying to prove?
Listen to him. Little Lord Fauntleroy!
Well it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.
What do I? Just a minute.
Are you going to leave, Mr. Kirkeby, or do I have to throw you out?
Dobisch Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
That's okay, Buddy boy. Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty first and I think I got lucky she's a skater with the Ice Show and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
Buddy boy she won't keep that long not even on ice. Listen, kid, I can't pass this up she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
Look, Baxter we're making out the monthly efficiency rating and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
It's only eleven and I just want the place for forty five minutes.
Let me worry about that. Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there
It is? Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
You threatening me?
Cancel? But it's her birthday I already ordered the cake
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Buddy boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath spend the night there sweat it out
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday that's the only night of the week I can get away.
What about him?
That so.
Who is Mickey?
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
Well, you can't win'em all.
Family?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
You got a girl friend?
Still stuck on her, huh.
I don't know you at all. BUD Permit me C. C. Baxter junior executive, Arthur Murray graduate, lover.
No kidding.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose bumps just to think about it.
I'm with you, lover.
Good night?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
My shoes.
Kubelik.
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
What gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim Museum.
Yeah. What's Buddy boy done for us lately?
Why did you take sleeping pills?
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.
Yes, I know.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long. Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
That's right.
Yes, I know. You want a lock to carry in your wallet?
I missed you, Fran.
It's been hell.
You don't know what it's like standing next to you in that elevator, day after day Good morning, Miss Kubelik Good night, Mr. Sheldrake I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
I don't believe you.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
I want you back, Fran.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead tell me.
No. I have a date at eight thirty.
Not very but I'm going to be there anyway.
Remember what we talked about?
I mean about my getting a divorce.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
That's enough, Fran.
You're not being funny.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute
I saw my lawyer this morning I wanted his advice about the best way to handle it
What do you think?
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me
Fran
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Is that what's been bothering you Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
Now, Fran
Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home because he's lonely, that's why all that was before you, Fran I've stopped running.
Merry Christmas.
I have a present for you. I didn't quite know what to get you anyway it's a little awkward for me, shopping so here's a hundred dollars go out and buy yourself something.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment
You'll miss your train, Jeff.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
It won't always be like this. I love you, Fran.
There you go again you know I didn't mean it that way, Fran. Just get well do what the nurse tells you I mean Baxter and I'll see you as soon as I can. Bye, Fran.
I rented a car it's going to be here at one o'clock we're driving to Atlantic City.
I know it's a drag but you can't find a hotel room in town not on New Year's Eve.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
Just walked out on me quit threw that big fat job right in my face.
That little punk after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
What are you talking about?
Sylvia sweetie it's not that but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
What's the difference? Some schnook that works in the office.
Where does she live?
All right I'll take you to the subway.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
Certainly not. I'm a happily married man.
Thursday? That's The Untouchables with Bob Stack.
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
Why don't we send her to a movie like Ben Hur?
Maybe we should send up two flies and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Propagate you know, multiply baby flies?
Where are you headed?
Look you know the girls Thta's Terri she was playmate of
Look we got in a little trouble they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this uh Operation Brute Force They just brought it back this morning.
Well I mean like they also took our fuel We've been here two days.
Look the girls could get killed we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
We could use some fuel just a half drum just enough to get us out a here.
Take your pick they all like you I can tell
Good like I said, take your pick.
Now just a second I'm doing you a favor, buddy what're you trying to pull?
Sit down we'll talk about it.
What!
How far do you think you can push what kind of people do you think
No absolutely not
You can keep your fucking fuel
Men of all races nationalities
I don't know what you're talking about Get fucked
Which part is that?
Delta?
North?
What unit were you with?
Rangers, eh?
I was an FO for the 25th.
Yeah.
Sometimes.
Thirty sometimes fifty.
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
How long were you up there?
A year? Waiter another beer.
Yeah typical A. R. V. N.
Why they call you that?
Chef is that'cause you like mangoes an'stuff?
A sauciere
What are you doing out here?
How?
Chef since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
Less than half sure is a mess down there.
Who's he?
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
I don't get it You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an'get our asses outta here. This Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America!
You got to kill this sonuvabitch Lance and me, we don'' t understand none of this Jesus, Captain I don't wanna die here Do it quick.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
' Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
Beats me the sun was too much for him, or the mud. Who knows?
No shit hot damn
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river.
While you were sleeping.
Yeah like keep out
Listen.
Who knows? Right.
I never heard about that.
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point
Whose orders?
Maybe.
Touchy.
You want me to clean it up simple and quiet.
Terminate?
Do me a favor buddy, please.
Nobody comes in here.
No, it'd be spooky without the war give'em back.
NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet their big assault.
Yeah.
No, sir.
I am not presently disposed to discuss that, sir.
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
Maybe.
Entirely unnecessary, Captain.
No, I've seen those in Normandy. This is much better. My country my country could never originate this. Magnificent.
Captain?
We will never'evacuate', Captain this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty one years, there is something to say for that.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
You can cut out the sir, Lance I'm Bill kilgore I'm a goofy foot.
That's terrible we'll change that I'd like to see you work I've always liked your cutback; got a hell of a left turn, too.
I said it's a good swell hell of a good swell'bout six feet. Let's get a look at it.
Napalm, boy nothing else in the world smells like that
What do you mean?
How big it is?
Change get out there I want'a see if it's ridable change.
You want'a surf, soldier?
Haven't got time, Hell's Angels lay it right up the tree line.
Take her in low, Lieutenant.
What's the furthest you been in?
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in?
What'd you do for supplies?
Can you trust them?
Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
' Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
Don't you agree?
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
I mean it's hairy they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit ten Cong to one.
What about this point here?
Yeah. Classical stuff scares the hell out of the slopes the boys love it.
The enemy. Who else?
The trees, eh...
Captain B. L. Willard reporting his presence, sir.
You were not coming here, to see me?
You came up my river in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did. You are the final justice, aren't you?
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
That's right, the little gook pricks. But they are noble little gook pricks, noble. Because they fight with their guts, like animals. And for an idea! That's rich. We fight with ingenious machines and fire, like Gods, and for nothing. But I'll call in a major blotto airstrike tonight. We'll have ourselves a helluva airstrike tonight, a lightshow. How do you like The Doors':'C'mon Baby Light My Fire... '
I love it.
Still playing by the rules. You're a damn good kiler.
How's yours?
Pain is easy to handle but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
The truth that you were sent here to murder me, ans so far you haven't done it. And do you know why? Yes, you know why. Your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it. Asshole! Schmuck! How long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here. Except me.
You know what you're doing? You are interfering with my plans!
I think think a lie stinks.
Stinks. I could never figure I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm and not let them write the word'fuck'on their airplanes.
I'll tell you what makes sense! Air strikes! White Phosphorus! Napalm! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
Going back to the jungle to die.
I had immense plans.
I was on threshold of great things.
Yes...
Maybe he'll get inside the tube where where they can't see him.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
Then let's get the hell out of here.
The Yater the clear one with the thin stringer.
You think he'd of shot us?
Any time us Americans.
He's a man who knows what he wants he does know what he wants.
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
You think?
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz. You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
Pre Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin'to California. I'm California dreamin'.
Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
I've asked myself that question. I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? He didn't shoot me, because I had a stash like you wouldn't believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana Hashish Opium cocaine uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid I make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley come on like piss. Now I'm Kurtz'own Disciple I listen he talks. About everything! Everything. I forgot there's such a thing as sleep. Everything. Of love, too.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
We're going ashore. Tie her up and leave your guns up, Lance.
I'm not ever goin'to tell you to shut up again.
Cognac?
The war will still be here tomorrow.
What's a big question?
Yes.
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
Did you know deeper in the jungle, upriver there are savages?
But Captain, I mean cannibals.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com Sec Int. Who's your commanding officer?
Well who the hell verifies that?
This Bob Hope or the like
Well, who's in command here?
What?
C'mon
Relax. I just want to ask them how the hunting is.
Leave my traps. We'll tag up, couple days.
I got your plate number, asshole. Maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these. Didn't expect we'd already met.
Six months. Ecological study for Northland Oil.
Send him down to her. There's money in my duffel bag, back at his cabin.
That makes the flight more interesting.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
Look, take these cuffs off. We need to work together.
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
Let's camp. There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Pushing it is flat wrong. All you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail.
Going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on.
I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb.
Sure. The People's Friend. Kiss your ass with precision if there's a vote in it.
You want to fool yourself about that bullshit job, fine. Damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along. You think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man more
Yep. Sometimes they do, but usually they end up crazy or dead.
There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon. I got money there. Remember that five thousand? Make it ten. Be smart. Take it and walk away.
What?! Fuck off. Save yourself.
It's a spring day...
Emergency transmitter? All your gear is back at Wilder's.
It was blown up with the plane.
Hate to disappoint you.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
All you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to. You don't understand shit! Trappers, hunters we're part of the environment. Who's protecting us? I've seen plenty like you. So more
I already have.
I'm sure she's fine. Seemed like a clever kid.
You're damn lucky, glimpsing this country before it's ruined, gone for good. You saw wonders you'd only dreamed of. That alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from, because you have dreamt them.
No way they'll find you on a five minute signal. And no way more

The time has passed for men like them and me. I know it. But they're still fighting for survival, like cornered animals. That's why they'll kill you. more
Let's get out of here.
We'll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to Fairbanks.
Just passing through.
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
Here's a hundred dollars. And if you or anyone else will back me up on this
If you have to ask, you wouldn't understand.
Snowplow, generator, TV dish... hell, we get the goddamn Playboy Channel! Here, this is for you.
Not a damn thing. What's going on? Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
Here?! Where's Wilder?
Jiminy Christmas. What do you want from me?
I'm the one should be sorry... Goddamn Kenai, always out for a score. I never should've let him go over there.
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
I'm real sorry. In a while, you're gone from this country. But we live here. No one wants to mix it up with those hombres.
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline. The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union. Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box. That's the beauty of it these icebox cowboys are living a century too late. Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads. With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
This isn't your concern. It's over, here and now.
We'll go with you.
I could've sat tight for the transport,'til Bob came poking around.
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
Stay out of it.
You met the gift.
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
C o n s c i e n c e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby sit so let's go out.
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little... You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking sorry hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married. Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any. Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose. What is it, Mom? No kidding.
Well, maybe he has nice friends.
Not bad.
It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station.
We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.
Just give yourself a little pep talk. " Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out. "
What do you care?
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine year old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
Spencer.
Spence.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Sorry.
Oh, please...
Okay, pal... I accept the compliment, but go easy my knees start a knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
Yes.
That's not why I'm here...... though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
Why did yo do this for me?
But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...
What needs clearing up?
Just how grateful I am.
I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
Okay.
What you did changed my life.
Lovely.
Now I want you to do something for me.
No, sir...
The stiff one eye?
I can't. I work.
My son.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
No.
Yes.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Oh. Okay, then Melvin. Good night.
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
I uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
And?
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
Okay.
One baked one fries.
I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.
Here's the trouble with never.
Sex with Simon?
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I'll never forget you said it.
Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there.
I don't.
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
I'll take you... why not?
How you doing?
That seems like a good choice.
The two might go together.
Cute.
I should've danced with you.
So long.
What do you want?
Grouchy?
What job?
What are you doing here?
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
Because...
Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon that way we're not screwy we're just two people who like warm rolls.
Just let me talk. I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer Spence...... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...
Well...
What a nice compliment.
No!!!
Uh huh...
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me... I'm sick of my own complaints... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
How to die, mostly.
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
That long neck the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
What the heck do you mean?
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as " obsessive compulsive disorder " and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
You changed the room around...
Yes. No.
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
You are very certain my dog is okay... because you have no idea...
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police... doughnut munching morons help me! Assault and battery and you're black.
Thanks for looking after him.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.
Hey you called me... I...
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Last word freak.
Terrify me?
Absolutely.
Sure thing.
Where'd they teach you to talk like this some Panama City " Sailor want to hump hump bar "? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else we're all stocked up here.
What?
Oh, is he dead?
We will if we can and if we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again.
Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that.
No, I didn't.
No... actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Verdell?
Go away.
Please, just leave.
Get out.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. You want to know why the dog prefers me... it's not affection. It's a trick.
Now we'll both call him.
Yo, yo, yo...
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
Yeah...
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
I give you that one... Nice packing.
Does it matter?
I love you.
Because...... you love her?
Okay... you tell me why " You're dying here. "
Did you like it that much?
Picking on me won't help.
But you know where you're lucky?
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything it's not always good to let things calm down.
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever so go catch her off guard.
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be... in here.
Aw come on, just a couple of questions how hard is that?
No... Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching... an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
Please!! NO!!!
Right.
What?
Uh, Fontella's
No. No I'm not.
Not too good at small talk, eh?
I know just what you mean. I'm pretty beat myself.
No shit.
Yeah.
Probably.
That was Peterson back there. That goes to the expressway for the airport.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
Just do your job.
You can't
Okay, don't.
Holy shit! Robert Rath wants to know my name.
Two years. Two long fucking years.
Sounds like chickenshit
Yeah, that's it. And he's like a fucking genius. They said he shaded you over and over. And in the end, he aced you again. Shaded and faded. They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit. I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?
Who the fuck cares about Cleveland. Cleveland blows. What kind of marks have they got here? Greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician. I want the money marks. I want the marks that you get.
Bullshit.
What does that fucking mean?
Yeah you are and you hate it. You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't. That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
All right, Bain. Pay attention, because this is where everything changes.
Shit. That sure is a lot of money.
You understand what's going on? It makes sense, right?
What I just said, no assassin would say. What I've said, only a mark would say.
You don't know a fucking thing about me. You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
I'll tell you this. After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive. But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city. Near the Plaza del Sol.
Take us there.
Um, five.
Took a guess. Lucky for you, I guessed right.
I work for the government.
You're one of them, aren't you? A fucking pro.
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
Now you understand why I'm here.
You didn't know anything about me.
An assassin?
What does that mean?
Someone hired both of you?
So this is something between you and him?
Why?
He wants to kill you?
Why?
And you want to use me to get him?
Forget it!
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
I don't need you to get the money my money!
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door
Why?
You don't know that you're trying to scare me.
How?
Electra.
Yeah.
No. Just Electra.
If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have?
Because I'm done.
Better than playing with yourself.
Why didn't you finish this game?
Because that's how it works. That's what it's about. He was the best. He was on top.
Yes. As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top. That's all there is. Until then, there is nothing. You are nothing.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
More or less.
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Languages. I was already fluent in nine languages.
Some people said that. I never thought so.
I was just different.
No. I graduated from George Washington University. Then I entered the Agency training program.
No, they didn't.
Of course. I was going to be James Bond.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive. The training, the weapons, the travel
Women? No... not really.
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Because you are a women.
The same reason everyone does. You hear your name on C SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
Yes. It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money. Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
My first take?
Why?
It was... mechanical. Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
No. Just the first one.
They become complicated... messy.
Did it ever bother James Bond?
This is fiction! Don't you see that? This is another reality. And the people that come into the world to play this game nobody forces them! They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks! Do you understand what I am saying? No one is innocent including you!
I don't.
Good.
Mexico.
About?
You were there?
I wasn't expecting this. I need to think.
It helps me to focus. It centers me, helps me think.
Work. The things I need to get done.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
Not even a stalemate?
What happens if you do?
That sounds nice.
In Costa Blanca.
Really?
Book. Sunglasses. Great.
How was the beach?
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
Cheap as shit.
It's too late now. Okay? We'll have to deal with these.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd. He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
No. It would be amateur. A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming. Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.
Then, we wait.
It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself. He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe.
He won't be able to. He'll have to go inside. He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there. If the bank closes, he won't know for sure. He'll come. I'm sure. And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
That's right.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed. You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
Five million apiece. You get on your plane, I get on mine.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
What?
I told you, he will.
I was.
Yes.
I don't believe that.
Ten years ago.
What happened?
What did he want?
What did he say?
Was that it?
You didn't take it.
Ten years later, here you are again.
I think I got one today.
They're worth less points.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
I went into their room this afternoon.
It was no big deal. I saw them leave, I went in.
Nobody ever sees me.
I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them. I wanted to, so I did.
Isn't it interesting though? I mean, look at us, in this room. Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market. I mean, we look like just another couple. But what are we? Doesn't it seem so crazy?
No?
I know. It makes me crazy.
I don't know. When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self preservation.
He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl. I watched my parents have this big fight, really big. I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up. And I watched them make love through the keyhole.
That's a ridiculous move.
Because, I'll take it.
Am I attractive?
Yes.
Why? I don't know.
Both.
Attraction is a complication?
It happened to you before?
Who was she?
What happened to her?
Did you
Was she the only one?
Is this becoming complicated?
When did it start?
Uh huh.
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
That doesn't sound normal.
I know. That's why I'm attracted to you. I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating. Maybe it's my curiosity / self preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you.
I waited another four minutes.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
I'm taking off my mike.
Electra
Last night
I thought it was interesting
Right. In my hands I have five back up disks he made of all of his work last night.
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
A pleasure doing business with you.
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Can you tell me about it?
Are you asking me if I believe in another life?
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'I never would though. Not really.
I don't know. Part of me wanted to but part of me always said,'What's she going to be able to do?'I don't know. Maybe I didn't trust her.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
Oh yeah? I guess we still need to see that price tag. Like art, right? You hang some painting that looks like baby puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
One hundred thousand? That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
Shit... oh well.
' Taken.'That's nice. When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
That's exactly what I told myself.
Right.
What are you thinking about?
And an R. C.
What do other guys do?
Some.
Can I ask you a question?
Why didn't you fade?
Yeah.
Yeah.
How would you like the funds?
This will take some time.
Of course, senor.
Hey Doug, you want a beer?
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
No, you guys are great together. He'll come through, I'm sure.
Sounds cool..... Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
I don't know, maybe I'll enrol for postgrad'studies next Autumn.
No, better than me. You know, I have many friends, you should meet more of them.
Wanker more like, what does he know about writing.
Because it's in English?
But we are underground?
Well, this place is too expensive so you've had it.
Never heard of K MART?
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
Fifteen crowns.
Still, fifty cents ain't bad.
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
Squatted it.
So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings why don't we get one?
Like Custer huh?
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
No " if's " or " but's " it's a cinch. Do you want to know what the icing is?
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep'song c'mon, don't run out on me now!
You got my word on it.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Too right.... Now the other thing we've got to do is start clearing up the rubble. Can you make a start on that?
And put it on expenses?
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space We'll neaten it up later.
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
No..... But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
Tell them we're working for the University.
Yep, except a name for this place.
Well, don't get carried away.
Good, I love swinging a shovel.
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
Really, " The Freeman Centre "?
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
I've been saying that since we met.
Just save me a little patch and I'll do it later.
No, it's welded up!.... Let's take a look from the inside.
I don't know. This wall isn't like the rest though, it's not all that old either.
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
No way, it's sealed if she's in there she's dead.
Just think though, it would make a hell of a cafe, that way we keep the auditorium clear.
I'll rig up something don't worry Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
Don't worry if the old lady's there I'll brick it back up.
You'd be better off with tables and chairs.
Destroy the evidence huh.
Nope.
Like helping a sick kid?
Close!
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
We're going to need it all.
Stealing's stealing, we might as well get what we need. This'll do for the floor and the walkway too.
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
So why didn't we?
No, not if you've got better things to do.
No, I figure once they see the place and we get'em a little drunk, they'll all want to help. We should have that floor done in a day or so.
Not on the opening night, wouldn't look right.
No, it could take me hours. You know what it's like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff I wouldn't think they've ever heard of them.
You're all bloody useless.
No, We aren't going to do it.
And a tram hit you?
What happened to Katka?
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes anyone I know?
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
A fine specimen for conversion.
Well, I take it you're going to drag her down to your minimal existence and adjust her mindset.
Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
Good, and then type up a notice on your computer for tonight's thing, photocopy it and put it up in all the faculty buildings and a couple of the pubs. It'll start at eight o'clock and the bar will be open from seven. Holly and I'll go and get some beer and wine. Can you bankroll the bar for tonight?
The performance is free what more do you want.... I've set that old phone up as a donation box and I'll get Jahn to write out a sign.... Okay, let's get going.
I don't want to ruin your day.
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
Huh?
They ain't the only ones.
Honza says they'll print an open letter to President Havel in next weeks edition even if they have to threaten a walk out.
Damn!
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
Now you're using that word.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover up.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
Yeah, somewhere?
Do you want me to see what's on them?
And if you're wrong.
What do you want me to do?
Yeah, Dave Walters.
Doug, I can't just leave you!
You could give me your baseball, so I can drive this bastard nuts..... He's been playing chequers for eight hours and still hasn't won a game.
I should have read the fine print. I love you Holly, thanks.
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to it was his only chance.
You're sure?
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Yeah, pretty well.
Yeah!
Follow that Budjovice sign.
Turn around quick!
You mean your NOT going to spring me?
Now Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen sixty two.
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
I've been around.
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
Here's the details.
We should be done by the weekend.
I could pencil you in if you like?
I think he's jealous of Havel.
Well not any more, now I'm a serious writer and above this crap.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
You're everything a guy could want.
Look, just hear me out, okay?
Nonsense, we can pick up the tram on the other side, it won't take any longer. Come on!
No, not just yet.
Let's have a look anyway.
Yeah, you're right.... I've got an idea!
I thought you loved me Doug but all you want from me is sex.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
Look, I love you Katka but I'm twelve years older, I could never marry you, it'd be stupid, you know that!
But we could go to London and live in England.
I'm sorry about what I said, really I am. Just take me with you, I don't care where.
Not this time, Kat.
Hey Chris, keep an eye on things.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
Sure, they are students.
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
Donations only! And make the thing non lingual, so everyone gets a handle on it.
Okay.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
About forty minutes.
Yes, of course... maybe one hour.
That's only the half of it. I've heard a rumour they're taking over a theatre to use for alternative arts; you know what that means?
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
You can hold back this months pay check until I come through with the story.
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
Two hundred dollars, make it six thousand crowns?
Insurance!
Will this thing take long?
You mean it's started?
How do I know what's being said?
Sure as long as you don't bring that prick Josh. Thanks Lawrence.
That's not what you said last night. And, I didn't bring that " prick " Josh.
What's the Bugler?
I figured you more as a Socialist?
A champion of lost causes huh?
We  re not all running away
One beer, one coffee, thanks.
Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor.
Run into Josh?
How did he look?
Why don't we both forget about him?
Cool.... Either of you know the way to Krakow?
And you broke into that room?
You will wish you hadn't.
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
Either you're a liar or you are a fool.
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
Really!
How do I know this isn't a trap?
I'll need to make a phone call.
Release Mr Greenwell's possessions.
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Come on, don't me give a hard time. I'm just trying to make the place look nice for Katka.
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Yeah.
Come on, that shit can wait.
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Okay honey, but don't be long. I got plans.
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
It's more than what you're worth.
Yeah and you're a slut, so what?
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
You really are a piece of work, you know that? You walk out on me and my family for some worthless bum and you expect us to help him when he screws up.
Alright, I'll see to it and things'll be just as they were, okay?
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
You are quite sure it's secure?
The storage facility will be ready within a week, I'll call you then.
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
I don't think you realise what will happen if those files are made public. The lives of thousands of officers depend on the secrecy of those records, including your own now.
And what of these foreigners?
What if his accomplices have made copies?
Subtitles  You have made many mistakes Pavel, let there be no more, for your sake.
I. Don't. Dance.
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
I do.
Why not?
' Bout what?
It could help with a new car
I can't know things if you don't tell me.
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
Were you with Jamie?
You sleeping with her?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
That's eight years of school and training after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
That'd be something.
It was the only thing I've ever asked him!
Now it's okay?
And you don't. What's she doing in there?
You.
I don't make small talk
You don't know me.
I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
Can't you have a normal conversation?
Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
' Believe in yourself and they will. Let me ask you, Lizzie. Look in the mirror? Are you pretty? '
This play?
My act?!
Because that's where the fire is?
No. Not like you.
I'm an enemy?
Maybe a little of both.
It's like a to do list, but for my life.
You want to tell me...
Ambitious.
You think so.
Do you think I'm strange?
Could be...
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
Yeah. I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
Yeah.
But you think about Him It Her.
No.
There is no point. You live. You die. The end.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
Your father doesn't like me.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
That would be the reason.
Then maybe you can read mine.
Prove it.
I don't want to be just your friend
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you
Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.
No. But are you impressed?
You.
I'm not allowed to date.
It's only 7: 30.
I know you want to.
Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff like on your list.
I'm sure. Pretty sure.
What do you actually know with religion?
That. And less strange.
Away from here.
Look. Talk. Not talk.
In my back yard. I lied before. It's hardly started. But when it's done, it will have twice the power of this one
Mars doesn't rise until 2: 30
Hoped for it.
I'm always home by midnight and he's always asleep.
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
Yes. I try to keep my power.
What are you going to?
Where? Why?
Then I'll take you home. You'll feel better tomorrow.
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night
Nothing.
Now? We just
' Find out who you are and do it on purpose.'Dolly Parton.
No. Maybe I believe God has a bigger dream for me than I had for myself. Maybe I believe the journey, the big adventure, never ends...
But if you could, you would?
That's right. You just act like one.
How would you do that, Mr. Carter?
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school
For the inner satisfaction it will bring. Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
You don't. That's the point.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
I've seen students with records like yours go to J. C. for a couple of years, then transfer to a good college.
You're welcome.
Are you?
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
Okay. Make me an isosceles.
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta
Where's your old man?
I don't get it. How come there's no rock'n roll?
This is 1952....?
And you never heard of rock'n roll?
Gimme some chili, fries, and a Tab.
Third time they've been out there this week.
Learn anything?
That's good.
I don't think I like the idea of you staying out all night with a girl!
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay. You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Yeah. Maybe so.
But he does! Don't you see?
George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
Oh I'm all right. Say, listen, about this dance Saturday night
The drill! The power drill I bought you for Christmas. I was using it last night.
Oh yeah.
Okay, then!
Huh?
Lemme see that.
Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter...
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8: 55?
And where am I gonna be?
Why what?
Yes, definitely, god dammit George, swear. Then you hit me in the stomach, I go down for the count, and you and Eileen life happily ever after. Now, hit me in the stomach.
Mr. McFly here wants to nuke it all, just so he can see it!
Hey, Mr. Arky, gimme a break! I'm seventeen years old! I'm not responsible for all these problems!
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
March 11th.
Nineteen fifty
A Tab.
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Yeah... Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom.
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Is something going to happen Saturday night?
What did you do to your hair?
Gone?... Where?
Oh yeah?
Can't afford to take chances.
You don't mind?
You expect me to believe that?
Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.
I'll catch up with you.
What do you feed him?
Does he bite?
You lost that one?
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
You ever had to open it up like that before?
You like people?
Then why'd you do it?
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
Good luck to you.
I mean it.
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
Yeah.
She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell people I deserved it.
I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around.
No, you're not either.
Cause I can't allow it.
Okay.
Jack.
I don't know.
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you. I'll try anything once. What's your name? I said mine.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?
Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.
Doing what?
Can I be honest?
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Yeah.
Nothing.
Well, I mean there's nothing he wants to know about it... I've got to run.
Quit my job.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
How do you say " Quit my Job " in Spanish?
Bring it along.
Anybody ever call you " Red "?
Why not?
Yeah?
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
No.
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.
Is that all there is to it?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
Well, that's the point, stupid.
I can look and see.
Well... I don't think that'd work.
Why?
Yeah, me too.
I got him in the stomach.
Well, I'm not going down there and look.
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.
No.
Yes.
" Rumor: Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact: True, but not with each other. "
Well, I'll catch you a big trout. Soon as we get to the mountains.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know.
Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should I?
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
He's not coming to take us for a ride, either. Come on, let's make a run for the car.
What?
We're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Well, he didn't have it last night.
Sure.
This your place?
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Fine.
Okay, no monkey business then.
Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it.
Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac.
Git.
I could've held off an army if I could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains.
No.
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary  Bill and I are... I love. We
No, no 
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his 
What. What don't I understand?
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this  believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I  I'm sorry listen, how are you  I'm sorry. You doing okay?
Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.
Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll sleep for a while now. What is it you have to do, exactly?
No, but the whole goddamn  Audrey? Have you ever had to read any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?
Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect. Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild. The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his
Before what?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project
Barton!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking
Well, m'olfactory's turnin'womanish on me  lyin'and deceitful...
Chet!
Chet! From downstairs!
Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures.
I  I've got respect for  for working guys, like you 
Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, really... He... He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures.
Just Bill, please.
So be it.
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
What's that?
... Huh? No, I'm 
I'm a writer. Ted O 
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
Then who should I talk to?
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture. What do you need, a road map?
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?! You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
A souse!
Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
You thought! Where'd you get THAT from? You thought! I don't know what the hell you said to Lipnik, but the sonofabitch LIKES you! You understand that, Fink? He LIKES you! He's taken an interest. NEVER make Lipnik like you. NEVER!
I didn't say anything
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
Well what do I tell him?
What do you do far a living?
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night  if the show sells out. Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
I'd say you're already enjoying some.
Take my copy. You're the toast of Broadway and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash  strike that, a lot of cash.
Okay.
Go ahead, son.
What do you mean, Barton?
Well, I'm... glad to hear that 
... That's fine.
... Barton, is everything okay?
Well, I'm just asking. You sound a little 
All right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there. Look, the liquor's good, wuddya say?
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  that's what I tell'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse.
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
Pictures! Jesus!
Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm not the best read mug on the planet, so I guess it's no surprise I didn't recognize your name. Jesus, I feel like a heel.
What do I write about?
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life  why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater? Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there? Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and  and  and who killed Nigel Grinch Gibbons?
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying  a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Sure you could! And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man  from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and  and  and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and  well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
Frequently played, seldom remarked.
Well, we've got something in common then.
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here. Figured I'd drop by.
I myself have yet to be lassoed.
Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. In my experience, they pretend to give it, but it's generally a smoke screen for demanding it back  with interest. How about family, Bart? How're you fixed in that department?
Yeah...
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself 
Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest thing in the world! You just get down on your knees to my left, slap your right hand here...
Ready... wrestle!
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
A little lift, yeah...
Defense against what? Insurance? Something they need? Something they should be thanking me for offering? A little peace of mind?...
Those two love birds next door drivin'you nuts?
Yeah, but 
You're leaving?
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
What a dump...
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
So they say.
Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.
Are you sure 
Why don't we go to your room
Hold on 
Hold on 
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
What do you think happened?
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
I believe you  I KNOW you. But why should the police?
You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.
Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
Yeah, but Charlie 
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
Less Hollywood? Sure, say it, it's not a dirty word. Sat whatever the hell you want. The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures. You don't believe me, take a look at your paycheck at the end of every week  that's what we think of the writer.... so what kind of pictures does he like?
... Yes, thank you.
And then... well...
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help 
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider 
Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards. They'd love to see me sit this one out.
Anyway, I had Lou read your script for me.
Don't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let YOU run the the studio. It doesn't and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run THIS particular asylum. So let's put a stop to THAT rumor right now.
I tried to show you something beautiful. Something about all of US 
Okay then, everything seems to be in order. Everything seems to be in order.
Transient or resident?
Rez. That'll be twenty five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
Kitchen closes at eight but I'm the night clerk. I can always ring out for sandwiches.
Don't you wanna go to your room?!
We got a treatment on it yet?
Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. And a romantic interest. You know the drill. Romantic interest, or else a young kid. An orphan. What do you think, Lou? Wally a little too old for a romantic interest? Look at me, a writer in the room and I'm askin'Lou what the goddamn story should be!
" Blood, Sweat, and Canvas ".
You're on leave, man. You're on psycho leave. I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose. Sit down, Nick.
I know it is but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
How about the coke?
No?
Yes.
You don't look so okay.
What else is new?
Catherine Tramell.
Who?
Yeah? Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out. But take my advice. Put a little more life into it than you usually do.
She must really be something. From a clinical point of view.
I hardly knew her. She gave me the creeps, though. I don't know why.
Yes you do. Something's on with you. You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
I thought you hardly know her.
I slept with her once in school. I was just a kid. I was experimenting. It was just that one time. She developed a... fixation... on me. She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did. It scared me.
I had him in two classes.
She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is. You're a good cop what did she do? Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant? Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it.
Were you with him last night?
Did you leave the club with him?
Did you go home with him?
Was there anyone with you last night?
If that's the way you want to play it.
Yes, you do.
But you didn't hurt
Because you didn't love him
Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies. For my writing.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
They were drug buys. I was a vice cop.
You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?
Yes. She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Only in theory. You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter? Not in theory in practice.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
I like you.
Yeah. Would you like to come up and have a drink?
Why not?
Not me.
Ice?
My wife used to call me that.
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately. You don't have any coke, do you? I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
It's not the same thing, is it?
A boy kills his parents. They have a plane. He makes it look like an accident.
Yes.
Good. I'd miss you. You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
Why take the risk?
It hurts.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
Everybody that I care about dies.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
No more games, Nick. I'm tired of playing games!
About three months before I met you.
I would've paid more. I wanted to know everything about you. Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.
I'll convince you.
Funny.
Did you? What's she doing?
Liar.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
No.
No thanks.
I'm writing a book.
A detective. He falls for the wrong girl.
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
Why not?
Why?
I told you. She kills him.
The games are over. You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.
Did you ever tie him up?
Really. Maybe that's why you're from Homicide. How?
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
It must really be somehtin'makin'stuff up all the time.
You make it up, but it has to be believable. They call it suspension of disbelief.
Sometimes.
I'm a writer, I use people for what I write. You write what you know. Let the world beware.
. 38 revolver. Never recovered.
No suspects, no motive. Unsolved.
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco about a year ago he asked me the same question. What's this about anyway?
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Nope, can't say that I do.
That's him.
What kind of talk?
He had a girlfriend?
Thanks.
You did.
I never heard of him.
Not now he don't.
I'm a smart sonofabitch. I just hide it.
Hallelujah.
I came in here to jack off the damn machine. One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein. Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what? He was her counselor.
You sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that.
I don't know.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
I wasn't there last night, either.
I don't give a... flyin'... chili bean... fart about AIDS!
What in the hell for? You think I'm gettin'any at my age? I don't like blue haired women. I don't like'em.
Say what?
I don't know. I'm just not.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
Why not?
If she's telling you the truth.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it if it happened?
Goddamn writers all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes. There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
You got goddamn tweety birds flutterin'around your head, that's what you got. You think you're gonna fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after? Oh, man.
She said alone suite 405. It ain't gonna take long.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
Yes I did.
Only if you're making it.
Cut it out, man! And don't be callin'me that shit!
Just look at him. Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? Honey, I don't think so.
I know that. Don't let him get away.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
Yeah... Maybe just his arms. Put some Cerulean Blue there.
 In this corner?
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
Who am I?
Oh yeah..
Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny. " Her name is G I N A Gina And she lo oooves me. " I did say chicken!
Concentrate on the ball. Shoot.
Your people.
Oh man! Folklore guy  worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says " Fuck that, I'm a MAN " and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike. Got a cigarette?
He drops dead! See? Just do your shit like you do it! Your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff everywhere. It's good. What else do you want?
Don't give him anything, man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides, he'll just use you. He's famous for that.
Good.
What's your fuckin'problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Drugs??!
Guess I just got sick of him.
I think I could do that alone.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477 0496.
I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear? How could you do that to me?
Manzanita....... if one day I die, and you read this piece of paper, I want you to know how much I love you. Although I'll never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face '
You're back.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
I'm your family.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee 
What's wrong with me?
What's that?
Don't you think he's using you?
Pretty much the same.
Forget it.
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
Would you check out my studio some time?
Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
Some of them.
No, I'd like the scarf.
I don't eat junk food.
You're a fast mover.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that? What is it  did your girlfriend leave you?
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said " Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world. " Think about it. Feel it.
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates. But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy. I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything. So what's your real name?'Samo? '
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
My point exactly.
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true. There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
So shut up and keep painting..
5: 11.
I can't. After the show.
Forget it.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop.
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
I need this?
Vichyssoise. Supposed to be cold, right?
' Fraid I can't. There's been a kidnapping... Tell Selina... Ms. Kyle... that some business came up no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her... let her know that I... not in a dumb " Be my girlfriend way, " but
Alright, thanks.
I think I'll take the stairs.
Ah. " Who ", may I ask, are you going " as "?
Good joke. Wanna hear another one?
I just can't sleep at night. Exploding department stores keep me up. One...
Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful.
Wrong on both counts.
You're not the Mayor.
What're you really after?
Things change.
Didn't I say that?
Well that's a... long story...
I'm listed.
Oh. " Kyle. "
I don't see how... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
I heard on TV, " Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds. " How do these hacks sleep at night?
And it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
... and me. No, that's be me and me. Is that what I said?
Executive Assistant. Secretary. Girlfriend?
What went wrong? Hang on, I think I know... You kept things from her.
And the truth frightened her?
" Vicki. " Ice skater, or stewardess?
Sure.
What're you doing three dates from now?
No hard feelings?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks...
You first.
I don't know anymore, Bruce...
No. No glass on the inside.
Mayors come and go. And heirs tire easily. Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
" Oswald " is linked to the Red Triangle Gang. I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
I am the light of this city. And I am its mean, twisted soul. Does it really matter who's the " mayor "?
Yawn.
My blood? I... I gave at the office.
Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
Was.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me... Naked sexual charisma?
Huh? You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
Oh, him again. He's already history check it out.
I want in. The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all... dirty. Maybe I'll give myself a bath right here...
I oughta have you spayed! You sent out all the signals!
Yes. Yes. Boyfriend trouble..?
... eight, seven...
All is shrill, all is blight...
My lips are sealed.
Quiet, Max. What do you think, this is a conversation?
Well it's not working.
If there were such documents and that is not an admission I would have seen to it they were shredded.
Max, elections happen in November. Is this not late December, or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?
I could teach her my " French flipper " trick...
A platform? Lemme see... Stop global warming. Start global cooling. Make the world a colder place. Frigid...
" You're doin'great, Mayor Cobblepot. " " Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot. " " I need you, Oswald. I need you now. That's the biggest parasol I ever "
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
I don't. So, no.
Okay, you have a point. Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
And a very, very good one.
Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
Actually I have to split. Take a " personal day. " You don't mind? Max, you're tops.
Eventually she married a young physician.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
It is the hearts of two good men whom I have had the honor of calling son. Take it, child. But I implore you, never open it. You look so like your mother.
The boys need help.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Why, yes, actually. Death and chance stole your parents. But rather than become a victim, you have done everything in your power to control the fates. For what is Batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world, an attempt to control death itself.
I've seen the best doctors! A gentleman does not discuss his health. It's not civilized. I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.
Not all heroes wear masks.
Women.
First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me. Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
Pamela Isley. I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly. I still can't. She used to work for Wayne Enterprises. Find a file.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions. Fear. Rage...
Their new computer sciences division. How did you know?
You are going back to school.
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
I guess, the truth is I'm just not comfortable with the idle rich. Even when they try to act like heroes.
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge. They kicked me out. it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
Servants, Masters, it's ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Happy. You honestly don't know, do you? You can't even see what's in front of your own eyes.
Why?
Be ready for anything.
I don't know. It just feels right.
Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The sun beam won't work.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
Of course. He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
How about, nice to see you? Glad you're here to save my life.
I can't believe we were fighting over a bad guy.
I'm totally over her. Positively.
Umm hmmmm.
No. Her case is too advanced. But maybe, someday, with more research
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
What can I do for you, Doctor? A research grant? A hospital wing?
We cut our support. A conflict of ideologies. Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
That lab was consumed by fire last week. how did you manage to escape?
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions. So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment. Got me?
But soon...
We've been going out over a year now and... Okay, here goes. Bruce, I want to spend my life with you.
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
I wouldn't bet on that.
You just called me Ivy. Who's Ivy?
You were right. I get it. You're not the marrying kind. You've made your point. Goodbye Bruce Wayne.
 Maybe it's something in the water.
Absolutely. Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Dick, you were reckless. You could have been killed.
You know Alfred. He'd never say Anything. But I can tell. Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had. Without him, I don't know how I would have survived. He saved my life, Dick. And I've never told him.
I'm scared, Dick. Maybe for the first time in my life. I'm really scared.
I checked the medical database. No one else is even close.
Like hell you do.
Or what? No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat. Crap! You just want her for yourself. Don't you? Answer me, damn it!
Hail the all knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
Oh but I am. For the first time in a long time. I'm through living in your shadow. All that ends right now.
And she did it all for me. For love.
Is that it, Bruce? I'm under some magic spell?
You'd say anything to keep me away from her. To keep her for yourself.
I'd love to stand here all day and exchange fashion tips but I'm kind of pressed for time. So hand over the diamond, Garden Gal, or I turn you into mulch.
An enticing offer. But what does the lady want in return?
Dear daisy, don't despair.
Hold it. You never said anything about a wife, frozen or otherwise
There was nothing I could do. Batman deactivated her. She's dead.
That is far too merciful. Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face. Their secret identities would be revealed. But how best to bait a brid?
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
How about dangerous curves?
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun. He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
One kiss, my love. For luck.
You should have heeded your pointy eared pal. These lips can be murder.
Love you? I loathe your bipedal arrogance, your animal superiority. My only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss is sucking the life from your ape like face.
Without your research, I could never have come this far. Join me. The two of us, entwined, side by side...
It's a wonder you sleep at all.
Hardly a worry, sir.
It'll never work.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize
Apology hastily retracted.
... The night Batman was born. What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
I remember the bat, though. His scream. Those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me. In time I came to believe that if I became a monster, that if I was feared, I wouldn't be scared anymore. I was wrong. They think I became Batman to fight crime. I became Batman to fight the fear. And instead I became the fear.
Take any three you like. After you get settled we can...
He killed them. Two Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
Actually, he took the car.
Not the Jaguar. The  other  car.
 No , sir.  The   other   car !
Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
Dick has run away. They have taken Dr. Meridian. And I'm afraid they found the cave, sir. It's been destroyed.
There's one other thing. I feel..
... Afraid.
... A bat.
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me. Oh my God, Alfred.
What do maniacs always want?
Precisely. So this number is probably some kind of calling card.
How about, MR. E.
And another name for Mystery?
Exactly. Mr. E. Mister Edward Nygma.
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
Al?
Master Wayne's dead wives.
Four seconds from...
Why's that?
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles'heel. It can be exploited.
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
What is it about the wrong kind of man? In grade school it was guys with earrings. College, motorcycles and leather jackets.
I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
You are direct, aren't you?
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
Exactly!
Um... I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
We'll talk some other
The press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way... And what light through yonder window breaks?  Tis the east. And you are...
La'chiem.
Rinka.
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes.
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
Exactly.
What do you know about obsession?
To kill me.
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch. Oops. Times up.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
And into a black dress.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
But...
Fast work. You just moved here.
He sure did.
I said I'm sure he did.
They've changed. The dreams, I mean. There's a new element I don't understand. A book. Black. Covered in leather....
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
You want me close but you won't let me near. What's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from?
Touchy, touchy.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Stop fighting.
I don't.
... Not the bat?
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents'deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Chase. There's something I need to tell you
I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two Face took... everything. Now I can pay him back.
Save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If it weren't for Batman my parents wouldn't be dead. You don't get it, do you? This is all your fault.
How about Richard Grayson, college student?
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us.
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
You're right, Edward. I didn't mean to be impolite. Please.
... The Box can change their lives. Our stock coupons will spike.
I don't think so.
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
What say we flip for it?
The coin  wants  to decide.
Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?
Congratulations. You get to die on the dean's list.
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
Everything.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
The small one.
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
I know the feeling. It won't last. He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have...... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman you're the guest of honor!
Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...... You made me what I am today.
Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live.
Shouldn't we
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
I'll take you with me.
Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. What's that?
It doesn't protect your head, though.
So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.
No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will. Untraceable. It's very elegant.
If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
I had to save you, Vicki. I Please trust me.
Great. Give me a grant.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
Because I...... Because she'd never speak to me again.
Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox I'll have one, too.
Good. With any luck we'll run into each other.
No.
Odd desire for anyone.
What did you see?
As much as I do. It's not that. I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
God. You would. Come on, Bruce. I just want to get two drinks in you. As an experiment.
... We could try that.
Mm hmm. Lunch. Not even dinner.
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...... I wish you'd reconsider.
Who's this'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
What if I could save a handful? What if I could save one?
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
Hang on. I have to leave a message.
In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne We do have laws.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by
I don't know. I'm just a D. A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE
Don't let your job interfere with your business. Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent.
About how pretty you are, pretty boy. Maybe he'd like to know
I dunno, man. After what happened to Johnny Gobs
That ain't what I heard. That ain't what I heard at all. I heard the bat got him.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
Is that what you " heard "?
And what happens if we say no?
That's it?
Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
Oh, it's too good. We got a six foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Small so far. I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Oh, absolutely. Bruce and I are very close.
Holy shit...
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Well, you know me. The more they've got, the less they're worth. This guy must be the most worthless man in America.
Yum, yum.
Something like this what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
Are they paying you for all this?
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
I've had it with you. I'm leaving.
Not what?
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
What do you say? Let's head for the lights.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Holy shit. Holy...
Yeeees?
There aren't hotels?
And what did you say?
David are you ever going to learn to say'no'?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy...
I know you are. Very serious... most of the time these days.
Yes. And I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Sort of half.....
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard.
Oh, right, yeah. two dollars please.
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.
What? What?
What happened?!!!
Howls he getting on with the family?
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers. Nice guy. Good looking.
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
You're an innocent and an optimist David that's why I love you.. Jesus what a terrible tie Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a little surprise for you and the Boss.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
David?
Right. Got it.
Good point Bernie precisely the kind of perceptive interjection I'd expect from my new V. P. How can we, you ask, survive without Whistler's Mother our single greatest asset? Well, the truth is we can't. So what am I saying? Will we find her again? Never this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius.
I said say that again, son because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
We have. In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
On the other hand... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs... Yes. Great news. Fabulous. Triumphant. Course it might need a little smoothing over. When's he due?
Yes, although, I really..... thank you. Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
You're not going to....
Exactly. She's in a surprisingly terrible state. Isn't she, Bean?
No. no, no, hold on... We cant sustain our loses so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.
Bravo. Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we? Don't want anything to go wrong.
Of course not. I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement. A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse.
Mmmmm...
And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family. Speaking of which if you'll excuse me.... I've got a lot of time to make up.
All the guys they claim are English to and good looking like Dan Day Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish. Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh. Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
Welsh.
Sure. You're right.
They're pretty. Learn it in the army?
I vote for Bart.
Well, there is that...
But is she gonna be okay?
Not at all, Governor. Very striking.
Off the peg?
And I'm sorry you look that way, short ass. That suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
You.
Are you?
What's gone?
This sucks.
Uh,... Oh yeah.
I need TV now! Now! NNNNDAMMIT!!!
Nnnnaah... We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
Beavis, this is the greatest day of our lives. Huh huh huh.
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
That's Butt Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Forget it, bunghole!
You should kick your butt's ass. Huh huh huh.
Uh...
Uh... We can't leave Washington'till we find that chick.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
This sucks. What are we doing here? Weren't we suppost'a go to Washington and score or something?
Yeah or like a Seven Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Whoa, this is cool! Heh heh. It's like, everything looks all weird and...
Okay. I'll go right after you.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Shut up, dill hole.
Turd burglar...
Bunghole...
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt hole...
Um... ass... head...
You already said that, Butt Head.
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
Really? I poop too much.
Uh... No, I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
You got half the state looking for ya how do you get away?
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father.
Jesus jumped up... Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference. Well, it's not gonna happen!
Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.
Who knows?
She sure does.
You scored with two chicks?!
Hey, you wanna see something really cool? Huh huh huh.
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin'ya?
Ten grand? That cheap ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
You'll be rich!
Adam my booyy! When you're really rich in what matters...... nothing matters! My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village. And he's got a little stress problem...... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
Does that mean you'd consider it in two weeks? You don't have to answer now. He wants me to check the deed restriction anyway. You take your vacation, Adam. Say'bye!
Almost.
God... Manchurian Tung oil? There's enough to refinish the gateleg table and the cherry wardrobe!
God, how I have looked forward to this, honey.
Let's not think about it. We'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation. Here comes the bridge chorus.
Adam!
You're doing it, Adam. You're saving this town.
Oh... I'm sorry...
I'm not sure. It feels... frozen.
I'll tell you what, Barbara. I don't think we survived that crash.
What?
... Hmmm?
Look at the publisher. Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch? Is this a punishment? Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to last?
Maybe this is heaven.
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me. As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
But I'm not hungry, are you?
I don't know. Jane, Jane, up here!
Just says'won't.'Wait a minute. Here it says'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead. '
At least we won't have to worry about her.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life? What can we do?
We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
I know. I'm sorry.
Death didn't improve your sense of humor.
But she saw us. I could feel it.
What about this Beetle guy?
Are you crazy? She can't hear you.
We need some help. I found something this morning. Here. Emergencies.'In case of emergency, draw door. '
How long do you suppose we were waiting?
You know you're really a pretty girl.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
Then it should be here.
... Yes this must be him. Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
Bet... el... geuse. What an awful name. I thought it was like you know. The juice of beetles.
No, we don't. We can work something out ourselves. We just have to try harder.
But we let him out.
N... No, I just did the Ink Spots.
But he didn't. We've got him where we want him.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls. She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
You can build another one... with her.
Give or take a year.
What?
Stepmother. I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
And this used to be your house, I bet. Why do you want to scare everybody?
You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you? My father bought this place. He never walks away from equity. Why don't you leave?
Oh puh leeze!
The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting says it all. Get'em out yourself. It's your house. Haunted houses don't come easy.
Start simply. Do what you know. Use your talents. Practice. We only help those who help themselves. Just do a little at a time. And of course, practice, practice, practice. It's tricky but you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?
Well, we didn't know
Yes. I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
He's a freelance bio exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker. He's pushy. He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
Yeah. He still tries popping up all over the place. But he can't join the party unless you call on him. Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go.
You people have really screwed up! I received word that you allowed yourselves to be photographed. And you let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of the handbook.
We're practicing.
I want to be dead too.
Life is just... too awful.
Honey today I am three hundred fifty thousand dollars!
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real! From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
You could double the size of your hardware store! You'll be rich.
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now. This house is too big. It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
He's your cousin.
Otho'll know what to do.
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Just don't tell Lydia.
I think she's in with them.
Lydia. Try to be civil. I'm going to see if I can set up a noise free zone in the study.
... asked you for something, didn't she? I'm going down to relax. I want a noise free zone. Do you understand? Noise free.
Lydia. What the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax? Go help your mother.
Stepmother's...
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest
This is not a joke! That sheet was full of ghosts.
Delia will cook...
Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
No, no, c'mon, Max, you know me. I've got plans. You gotta come up here and see, then I'll tell you about it.
Great idea, Maxie! Those Japanese could run it for us. Build them a dormitory in the woods. Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
Joke! Joke! Aspirin! It doesn't matter what brand.
Don't you dare talk to others about me. I'm an artist! The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends. Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
Tried to convince me that this house is haunted. Kids. Kids. Kids! I love them.
It doesn't matter. What matters is I've got a roomful of guests down there, who think I'm a fraud. I am going to teach you something here Lydia. You've got to take the right tone in things like this, or people whether they're dead or alive people will walk all over you. Come on out, or I will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never lived!
No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
I know... I read your book, The Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf.
Viridian? What is...?
Oh, as long as we're here...
Let's see. We could turn that into a media room.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code. I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
Well, I just placed a call to your mother. She had stepped out but I have some news for her.
Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X ray your leg.... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
An attorney?
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
Oh, I see...... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
Shame on you, Chauncey you should let me be the judge of that. Please, sit in the chair.
... Oh.... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
... Oh? You've heard?
He does, does he?
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
Oh, really?
Yes, I suppose that's true.
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
Yes, Robert I am. I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.
Of course! By kid lawyers!
I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
No, Eve... I'm sorry.
He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...
I wish he were here...
I do we do both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Certainly, glad to be of help.
Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Oh. I have a message for him.
A Black man gave me the message.
Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
I see.... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal why, it might be hours before you are treated...
Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you... David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...
I admire that in a person. As for myself, I find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times...
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
... And Ben is just mad about you you've lifted his spirits so it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
He does...?
Your leg must be getting better.
Good. I'm glad to hear that.... How did you like meeting the President?
Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
I'm sorry...... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Of course.
Oh, I like that very much.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
He's tired, Chauncey but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
I know you do you and your television...... Good luck, Chauncey.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older...
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the'This Evening'show are quoted side by side with the President's.
I know...... So are you, Chauncey...... Do you mind my being here, like this?
I know you are, Chauncey...... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until...
Hello, Dennis.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here I feel it a little myself. You're an angel, my dear thank God there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort.
... Come in, Chauncey please come in...
To watch...? To watch me...?
... Is that all you want...?... To watch me...?
... But I've never done...... You mean...? When... When... When I do it?... When I touch myself...?
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
How is my dear friend Benjamin feeling?
Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover. Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.
To exchange our thoughts what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
So you know Krylov!
Yes, it is very good!
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
And yours, sir Chauncey Gardiner! How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend!
Thank you.
Yes. I like that very much.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
... So am I, my boy so am I.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
And I'm Ben.
Bravo!
Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
Hah! It's all make up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
No one likes a dying man, my boy because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope you're a truly peaceful man.
... Maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position, Chauncey... Maybe one day...
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately seldom if ever at all.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
And, please, Chauncey don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you must excuse me I'm very tired all of a sudden.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength... Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
... I've worked very hard and enjoyed my life... I've known success... and I've felt love... My associates, Chauncey I've talked with them about you... They're eager to meet you... very eager to meet you... I'm very fond of you, Chauncey... And I understand Eve... Tell her that... tell her I'm madly in love with her...
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too. We can go this way.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd.
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
... Sir?
Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
... Oh.
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
Very good.
I see.
Yes. It seems to be.
I'm afraid he's slippin'a bit with every hour that goes by...
... I see.
Yes. I've seen that done.
... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white.
Well, ain't that the truth...
Well, no more stewin'those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...... what are you goin'to do now, Chance?
You're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy...... You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance... But I guess it oughta be an old lady,'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours...... You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you?... Goodbye, Chance...
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Louise?... The maid?... But she should have left earlier today...
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
You live here?... We don't have any record of that.
... How long have you been living here?
Since you were a child?
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
How were you paid?
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
1952...?
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty five years, since he fractured his spine.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers.
Yes, I understand.
Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.
I have no claim, Thomas.
Correct.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
... In the garden?
... Spring and summer... Yes, I see... Fall and winter. Yes, indeed... Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. I will.
... Skip the levity, Kinney what have you got?
Sure, try again where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Sid, it's useless!
No headaches?
You heard?
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Do you feel well enough for that?
That's good... That's good.
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
... Would you take me on a tour?
... Yeah...
Well... He's either very, very bright or very, very dense he's hard to figure...... Let's just keep everything legal.
No! He's a real gardener!
Good night.
I said good night!
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Hmmm... Take this down. I want this quote included in the Tass coverage;'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that " Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes. " '
And put it through on a Code Red I want it as soon as possible.
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt. I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time. I've got to take a leak.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
So...? Where the hell is it?
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
I would appreciate that.
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
Yes, chief eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around the clock now, sir I'll keep you posted.
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
Let us toast to the success of the coup.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you. Here, sit down, get off your feet.
... Well?
Well, Ben... I...
That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.
I'm afraid so.
Nonsense, Mr. President I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
You take care too, Bobby.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one puppet extravaganza in Reno.
John Makel...
I never played a jewel thief.
I don't know.
Yeah, okay.
Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough I've been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no! Please say no!
Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous. All of them fat and alone like me, all of them dream of being someone else, all of them with John Malkovich as their second choice!
Enjoy.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
What?
Which one is Elijah again?
Yeah. Okay.
Seven ish
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
Just an idea I had.
Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. We  re supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is.
I was worried.
Tom Tom's puncture wound is infected.
The iguana.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
' kay.
I want to try.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
Now?
I have to go back now.
I was, wasn't I? I was John fucking Malkovich! Take me back, Craig.
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.
Why?
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
You've always hated the animals.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
Us, of course.
We wish.
And he was with her.
We?
Don't forget me.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions. I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
Suck my dick!
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
I'm a puppeteer.
You fell in love with her first.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
I need a shower.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
It's Elijah.
The monkey.
A better friend.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
People make mistakes.
I know.
Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help. Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Sure, after a fashion.
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
I know. I'm sorry...
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Pardon?
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
Money, Miss Warts?
Yex?
You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
Music to my ears! Whatever you said. Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent friend, speak!
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you  re implying.
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
No.
No. I understand perfectly.
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
One hundred and five. Carrot juice. Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
No sir e bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris'naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
All right. Meet me at the Juicy Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us? You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
Thank you, sir.
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
Uh, import export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1 / 2 actually. In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.
Is that true?
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
Emily Dickinson.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.
Yeah.
Why not?
Who told you?
Who told you?
Somebody told you.
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
Yeah. But enough about me.
I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
Please, let me explain.
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Tickets to Malkovich?
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
You wanted to be partners with me?
Really? But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
I've fallen in love.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
That's right, Wendy, it is against floor policy, but as long as you're here, let me tell you what I know about our cute little door friend. Many years ago, this very office was occupied by a kindly old watchmaker named Mr. White.
It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness. I learned that from you.
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
No. Don't be an ass.
You can be John Malkovich.
Two hundred dollars, please.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you? Nice to meet you all.
Vegas? What'd you think?
Impressions? Those are hard.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
What kind of circumstances?
The Great Mantini?
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do " Tru " with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek.
Forget it.
Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
Thank you, Floris.
Good morning, Lotte!
But of course.
Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
Oh, be still my heart.
With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
But now we've lost access to Craig.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
Oh, sorry. Right this way.
I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs. Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
When?
Maxine...
Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Yeah, I saw them
What's the play?
Never heard of it.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of " Long Day's Journey Into Night. "
Is there dancing?
Who needs dancing?
Who's calling?
How'd you get this number?
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
I'm getting better all the time.
No... damn... you... Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.
Wow. Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
I'd love to see your work.
You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
No one would ever have to know its not him.
Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!
Sleepy suddenly.
You've got to be kidding.
And she is mine...
THE WHITEFOLK?
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
I had another dream last night. The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
You're weren't nice to me.. you didn't smile at me..
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
You on your way home?
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
She gone like they say?
You think she sure'nough your sister?
You grown.
Well, good luck with the job.
What you want?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
What you want'em for?
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Well, come on in. You letting in flies.
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman... Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
They getting older now and I can't take care of'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
Be here. In case.
In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad I can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. Anything. Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
Could be that fall you took.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
Won't you be late for work?
But mama..
She likes this dress...
No, You looking good.
She comes in the daytime. She still with me, my Denver.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Aw, girl. Don't cry... Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
What? What? You talking back to me?
Yeah. Too sweet.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Yeah, okay.
Uh?
He looks like a fuckin'loser.
Yeah. Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
Well Dude, we just don't know.
Her life is in your hands.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done.
But I guess she told Dieter.
I want a fucking lawyer, man. I want Bill Kunstler.
Uh huh.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady
Hey, man, I'm not
The Gundersons.
The Gundersons. It's a wandering daughter job. Bunny Lebowski, man. Her real name is Fawn Gunderson. Her parents want her back.
Well maybe you and me could pool our resources trade information professional courtesy compeers, you know
NO RULES! YOU CABBAGE EATING SONS OF BITCHES
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
I FUCK YOU! I FUCK YOU!
Yes. I understand you're taking away the remains.
That is our most modestly priced receptacle.
Don't need it. We're scattering the ashes.
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
What
I was bowling
What's wrong with Walter, Dude?
That's fucking exactly what happened, Dude! That makes me fucking SICK!
This Saturday. Quintana and
It's already posted.
What's that, Walter?
Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not gonna kill shit. They're not gonna do shit. What can they do? Fuckin'amateurs. And meanwhile, look at the bottom line. Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars? Am I wrong?
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
Are you gonna split hairs?
Am I wrong?
Shut the fuck up, Donny. We'll, uh, brace the kid he'll be a pushover. We'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already. Million fucking clams. And yes, we'll be near the, uh some burgers, some beers, a few laughs. Our fucking troubles are over, Dude.
I've had a
Had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man
Please, feel free to inspect them.
Please! Please!
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given not necessarily given every year! Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs. Reagan on the left, taken when
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes. And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
Wonderful woman. We were very
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak
No, they
They're not his, heh heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner city children of promise but without the
Without the means for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski has committed to sending all of them to college.
One oh! Heh heh. You never went to college?
Heh heh
Yes, heh
White Russian, thanks. How's the smut business, Jackie?
Which one was Logjammin'?
Of course you do. I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is. Where's Bunny?
Me? How would I know? The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Let's say a 10  finder's fee?
Who the fuck are you? Why've you been following me? Come on, fuckhead!
Huh?
Francis Donnelly. Pleased to meet you.
Oh yeah?
" Johnson "?
Right, but let me explain something about that rug
Excuse me?
I was talking about my rug.
You mean coitus?
Oh, no.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with do you have any kalhua?
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey. Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career
Well sure, I could do that
A hundred.
Yeah, but what about
That's really thoughtful but I
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
She most certainly was not!
And please don't call her my mother.
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
From who?
Dieter Hauff?
Her " co star " in the beaver picture?
Dieter has been on the fringes of well, of everything in L. A., for about twenty years. Look at my LP's. Under'Autobahn. '
Well... yeah
Well yeah... I know that.
Well, no, not exactly. It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins. Lotta outs. And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man. Lotta strands in old Duder's
Huh? No, really, I don't even have the bruise any more, I
I want you to see him immediately.
Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh... Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
Yeah. Roadie for Metallica. Speed of Sound Tour.
Bunch of assholes. And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
Oh, you know, the usual. Bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback.
Finder's fee?
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's. Why did he think you had it? And who does?
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money. Father doesn't have any.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance. He has no money of his own. I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
Well... no, of course not
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude
Huh...
This was a valued, uh.
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue! I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude. Across this line you do not, uh and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh... Asian American. Please.
What the fuck are you
No, but
Yeah, but
Theodore Herzel.
State of Israel. If you will it, Dude, it is no
Huh? Oh Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
What do you mean " brought it bowling "? I didn't rent it shoes. I'm not buying it a fucking beer. He's not gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.
Hey man
Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
He's fragile, man! He's very fragile!
Am I wrong!
That's your answer to everything, Dude. And let me point out pacifism is not look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq pacifism is not something to hide behind.
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Calmer than you are.
The man is a sex offender. With a record. Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight year old.
Just for making the hand off?
I told him if it was during league play
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
Have it your way. The point is
The fucking point is
Agh
Walter what the fuck are you thinking?
We? What the fuck we? You said you just wanted to come along
Yes you're wrong. This isn't a fucking game, Walter
They hung up, Walter! You fucked it up! You fucked it up! Her life was in our hands!
We're screwed now! We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
Okay Dude. Have it your way.
That's the simple part, Dude. When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat it out of him.
Thaaat's right, Dude. The beauty of this is its simplicity. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong. If there's one thing I learned in Nam
There is no fucking hand off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out of the car!
We throw the money out of the moving car!
Wooden bridge, huh?
The bridge is coming up! Gimme the ringer, Dude! Chop chop!
Okay, Dude. No time to argue. Here's the bridge
What the fuck?
Uzi?
Huh? Oh, him, yeah. Well I don't see, um what exactly is the problem?
No, Walter! I said I thought she kidnapped herself! You're the one who's so fucking certain
Walter
" Our " car, Walter?
It's been stolen, Walter! You fucking know it's been stolen!
Aw, fuck it.
How the fuck should I know? I do know that nothing about it indicates
Fine, Dude. As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe
You want a toe? I can get you a toe, believe me. There are ways, Dude. You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
I'll get you a toe by this afternoon with nail polish. These fucking amateurs. They send us a toe, we're supposed to shit our selves with fear. Jesus Christ. My point is
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude. So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes
FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
Don't run away from this, Dude! Goddamnit, this affects all of us!
Thanks Walter.
Yeah, thanks Walter. That gives me a very secure feeling.
That makes me feel all warm inside.
This whole fucking thing I could be sitting here with just pee stains on my rug.
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
Fuck your sympathy! I don't need your sympathy, man, I need my fucking Johnson!
Near the In and Out Burger
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
Yeah.
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Uh huh.
Uh huh.
No.
Uh.
Dude, please!... Is this your homework, Larry?
Is this your homework, Larry?
You're going to enter a world of pain, son. We know that this is your homework. We know you stole a car
And the fucking money. And we know that this is your homework, Larry.
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up
Huh?
It is a fucking emergency.
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to
WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA GO TO PASADENA! COME PICK ME UP OR I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man! He's had enough! He no longer digs her! It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks? I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
His million bucks was never in it, man! There was no money in that briefcase! He was hoping they'd kill her! You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
Shit yeah!
Huh?
Walter, come off it. You're not even fucking Jewish, you're
You're fucking Polish Catholic
Yeah, and you were
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
This driveway.
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing. Taking care of her fucking dog. Going to her fucking synagogue. You're living in the fucking past.
Sure, I'll put him down, Dude. RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!
Yeah, I can see that, Dude.
We're sorry, man. We're really sorry.
I mean'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk. I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank. Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
That's fuckin'combat. The man in the black pyjamas, Dude. Worthy fuckin'adversary.
They shot Donny!
It's a heart attack.
Call the medics, Dude.
Hurry Dude. I'd go but I'm pumping blood. Might pass out.
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS!
What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything! What the fuck were you talking about?!
So, like I say, just thought, you know, fair warning. Tell Walter.
Dude the Bagman. Where do you want us to go?
Okay, listen
Yeah.
Hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go.
Friends like these, huh Gary.
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski; you're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude. So that's what you call me. That, or Duder. His Dudeness. Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing
Employed?
Is this a what day is this?
No, look. I do mind. The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man. I mean, if your wife owes
Huh?
Is it... is it, being prepared to do the right thing? Whatever the price? Isn't that what makes a man?
Fuckin'A.
They did not receive the money, you nitwit! They did not receive the goddamn money. HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS!
I the royal we, you know, the editorial I dropped off the money, exactly as per Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh you know?
I'll tell you what I'm blathering about! I got information new shit has come to light and shit, man! She kidnapped herself!
All right, get out. Both of you.
Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake. A fucking goldbricker.
Bullshit. Eight, Dude.
Bullshit. Walter!
Yeah, but I wasn't over. Gimme the marker, Dude, I'm marking it an eight.
All right! There it is! It's fucking zero!
Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you could take me.
You'll take him.
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
No. They've been training to hunt you.
We're going to be working as a unit, you people will be taking orders from me. So let's get it over with. I'll give you a free shot, Reinhardt.
What about Nomak?
I didn't know.
Which means he turned about seventy two hours ago.
Time.
Nomak's different. He's the carrier. There's something driving him beyond the Thirst. Something we're missing.
Exactly. Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified. Super charged. And this
Really? What are we supposed to do, then? Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live? What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing. A drug dealer. How do you justify saving people like that?
" Each day is a little life. Every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death. "
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Get real. I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on. Now that it's over, all bets are off.
Well it's in mine, too. I'm a pureblood. I wasn't turned. I was born this way. Just like you. Am I evil because I want to survive? What about a wolf? What about any predator?
Took you long enough.
What do you really think?
I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Just out connecting a few dots.
Spare me the race card, OJ. We're not going out into the sun. It's too risky.
So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.
Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.
Nomak?
Well you've got it, warmblood. Now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
It depends. We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
Whatever What'd you do to the Charger?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Nope. Back then we did not.
Going on twenty years now.
Blade doesn't talk about anything much. What about you, though?
Back when Blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass. What's up with your hair, anyway? Fucking Willie Nelson look a like?
She hasn't turned yet. You can help her.
It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her.
No, we can treat the wounds
I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
Am I? You think the humans will ever accept a half breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you. The humans fear us because we're superior. They fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete.
You sure now? I bled a newborn for this. You won't find a drink that's sweeter.
You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
There are other ways to see. Sit.
Show me.
The vampire God. This speaks of His return.
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
You've been here longer than you think.
What happens then?
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career
That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful.
You used me as bait?!
But, he could've
Because they're vampire wanna bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.
You don't know that.
Graffiti
The way they move, they way they smell
Like what?
Isn't this all a little high tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
You don't look so good.
How long have we been driving?
You don't understand. The Thirst
No
I was in the neighborhood.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
Fight him
You don't have to be.
You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
I don't know Look at this blood smear
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up
What happens then?
LaMagra
Who better to usher in the Blood Tide?
But you use blood banks
There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative.
You think I'd let him run loose without a chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat holes out, I map them. Then we blow them all to kingdom come.
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control. The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure
Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience.
Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in
Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?
With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle cell anemia.
Try, please, Anna
What do you mean?
What happened to her, where did she go?
Anna
Nick!!
What're you doing there?
Inside the grave?
I was out hiking, camping the past two days that's what did it I killed it
Something was wrong.
I guess
I'm not staying here!
He's not my husband!
Christ.
But she was nicer then sweeter she hadn't vomited twice already like today
A six week bun in the oven
Think again.
Who?
Then there she blows.
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of'em when I get back to Baltimore I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
That's its name. A pastoral glade gamboling with crackheads and homeless and averaging at least one homicide a week.
That's not whatzername it's Mary Brown.
Or one huge attack of group hysteria.
Yes.
Do you agree it's that old, Nick?
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
No this is weird.
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind like putting this safari together.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
Your body, your call.
Could we take this up later like indoors, without half the world listening?
Anna
I don't know.
You want me to scooch over next to you?
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
I'm not going anywhere,'til
I guess, yeah.
Just now?
Just... try and go back to sleep.
What'd you dream?
Here.
Then I'm going
The clothes take'em off I want to see every square inch
I see for proof positive you're the goddamn witch
Beta Cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
Hours before
No one'll ever know.
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
Looks like a rope.
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
It's my fucking job, man!!
My ass you saw those four fucking baboons put'em there!
I don't know yet.
Something. Someone.
Fine.
Fine.
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown up, enhanced
Four in the morning?
And unlike the first one, every second of it's gonna be true! " Blair Witch: The Real Story! "
Shut up.
Never would've guessed.
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
Three people: two guys, a girl sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
No fucking.
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
Try a long walk.
What?
Just go.
Hey, hon'this is what pays the rent and tuition.
Gimme it!
Cotter, where can I get on line?
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
Things got a way of finding you here.
Yeah. Me too.
Into the Black Hills with 200 something miles from here
One of us, all of us I have no idea brought whatever this thing is back here. We're not going to go out there and spread it around like Typhoid Mary. We're gonna figure it out, we're gonna bring a goddamn end to it.
Goes right along with these two.
Shhhh!  5, there's something up there!
Doesn't say it's just these pages.
The wheel.
They're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper
About the Witch
Turn the goddamn camera off!
We're all going to be if you don't hit the brakes.
Right. And the check's in the mail.
What?
What happened to the goddamn " Witch watch?? "
They were making a movie if they were going to steal anything it'd be just the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't.
By day? No sweat.
It's not a real " funny " time for us, okay?
Enough to make shapes and shadows in the dark into something else.
All the shit that was worth anything, yes. You'd be amazed, though, what you can get free on the'net.
It's less than four feet, just
Why?
What?
Not planning on sleeping at all.
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
Two to one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back.
Elly Kedward?
That's the reason.
I know, I know
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
Whatever all I know is the persecution's going to start all over again, they keep pumping out inflammatory bullshit like this fucking movie
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking go she won't leave this place.
I know!
Yeah, I know. It's... alright. We're all a little
Heather.
Okay. Hypothetically.
You think.... there could've been something up in those woods that Anna
Why in the world would she
You know what we picked up in the woods
She's far from " fine. "
Fuck Anna!
Not this one.
Why?
Not that I've seen but that has no meaning that means nothing.
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
Well I do...
Abby...
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
You don't look too good. You sleep last night?
What was that?
Where... where you going?
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
On the phone. Was it for you?
Uh huh. So how do you know it was a he?
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
... Well, I'd be okay in here
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much.
What'd he say?
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
When you don't they're usually nice.
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm hmm.
Ray?... What time is it?
Yeah...
Abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. And when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead...
You broke into the bar. You wanted to get your money. You and Marty had a fight. Something happened...
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Give Debra here another drink, and give me the usual.
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
Christ, I'm getting bored.
Channels, we got two and six. Two don't come in so hot.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
What night is it?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
... Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
Yeah...
I told you. I like you.
Well now you do.
What's the matter?
Sign.
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Fine. Suit yourself.... Having a good time?
What're you, a fucking marriage counselor?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
Most of the night...
... Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
Yeah? Well how irritated are you?
Well what?
You're an idiot.
The money. Yeah. That's a right smart of money...
... What?
... What?
Yeah...
Listen, what is it? Is it done?
Jesus, I don't believe it...
Nobody knows you hired me?
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
I don't know, didn't he call?
Red Label.
Pour that back.
Don't throw that out.
This.
That's not the point.
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Wasn't too busy. You missed a good one, though. This white guy walks in about one o'clock, asks if we have a discount for alcoholics... I tell him to get lost, but Marty's sitting here listening and I can tell he's thinking that maybe it ain't such a bad idea...
Thanks Meurice.
Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my head here, I mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT? Enough to light Las Vegas for how long? How many years? Course, I'm no mathematician but
Tuesday is ladies'night.
Tuesday night is ladies'night. All your drinks are free.

Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet. Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Shit. You better tell me something.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
THEN WHAT?
How many times have you sneaked into girls'apartments and watched them undress?
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you. Get undressed. I want to see you.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
No way.
What do you want?
Lie down on the bed.
Sure I'm alright.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
See my breasts?. See?
Yes.
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
No.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I? Sometimes I think it would be fun. Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret. I want to die.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
I'm alright. go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Falling.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Yes.
No. I should go.
Yes. Frank
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.. don't hate me.
I'm not crazy. I know the difference between right and wrong.
Are you a bad boy?
Do you want to do bad things? Anything. anything.
I want you to hurt me.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
Shut up.
Come on Dorothy.
I asked first.
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
You. what?
There's no disease, I can tell you.
I'm glad you do.
Dorothy. no!
You called me Jeffrey.
Yes.
No. not really. but also because I really want you to be alright.
I think I better go.
What?
You look beautiful to me.
My secret lover.
Who, Dorothy?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
I don't want to go.
On a ride.
Do you see, Ben?. I can make him do anything I fuckin'please.
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin'walk back.
Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes. You like me?.
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
What kinda beer do you like?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin'beer.
Good, let's drink up.
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
How is Central these days?
What else is new?. right?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
I don't know. you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
Oh yeah. What about those other people?. Anything?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
It's not bad. but it's bad enough. it's a lot worse for my father. I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy. she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Now, how are you going to do that?
What will I say when she comes to the door?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream,. but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
You've got a point there.
Let's go.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck. three minutes, no sooner.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Yeah, if it opens the door.
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
Yes. I do.
I already know. The " Slow Club. " It's on Route 7.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Brilliant.
This is not my usual Friday night!
Two.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
Yeah. but.
O. K.
. I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Okay. yeah, call.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
What did you see?
I'm sorry, I didn't.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You saw a lot in one night.
Twice. without her sensing anything?
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah?
Who, me? Why should it?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
So are you. I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Okay. okay.
See ya tomorrow.
What am I going to do?
Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Shoot.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Yeah.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.
You didn't tell him about me?
Just some fatherly advice.
It's good to see you.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
It's okay.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Really?
NO.
Just a minute.
Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
Yes.
Probably not. no. Why?
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
... Sandy?.
Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
Well.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
I don't know why we have to watch T. V.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire. He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump off point.
Yes. Jack Stevens is already a very busy man. Along with many others. You shouldn't stay away so long.
Alright. I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you. I don't think there will be a problem.
Ha ha. That's too much, Georgie. Those days are over. The rate is one thousand dollars. Inflation, you know?
I don't know. Drunk somewhere. Try the bar. And if you find her, tell her to come, it's almost midnight.
Dejen la maricada pues! No jodan! Nadie va a matar a nadie! George, debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica manera, mano.
Just everything. You. California. The beach. This spot right here. I feel like I belong here, you know? It just feels right.
Yeah. I am.
Just everything. You. California. The beach. This spot right here. I feel like I belong here, you know? It just feels right.
Yeah. I am.
We'll take it.
Okay, guys, we're gonna leave. Let's get the check.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
No, not at all. Sure. You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Oh my G d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Promise me that we'll never be like them. I don't want to wind up like that.
What, and miss all the fun? C'mon, not a chance. So, what's the verdict?
Two years. George, I can't wait that long.
George, I went to the doctor. I don't have two years.
It's garbage.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
It's garbage.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
Excuse me?
Really. Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
So you do have an agreement with the United States Government, Mr. Jung, correct?
Tell me about the suitcases. What is the make and the color?
Whose cloths? Your clothes?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
I demand to know everything. I do not trust six hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
The coca is my responsibility!
You. Your responsibility is over. You do not fly. You are not a pilot. You are not a distributor. You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane. That is all. You make a percentage. A generous one. And you're lucky to get that.
Padrino will pay ten thousand per kilo. For everyone. For you, and you, and you.
I know what you want. But, first of all, are you cops?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
I guess not. Okay. You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
I know what you want. But, first of all, are you cops?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
I guess not. Okay. You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
And I only deal with you?
Sell it?
Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?
Look, I'm sorry about everything. I feel like an idiot. You were right. I did fuck you. And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
I lost sight of everything. Forgot who my friends were.
You?
That was out of line.
Your offense? Why are you here?
Intriguing. I see. Would you like to know my crime?
No?
Me, too. Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good. But we are roommates, okay? And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars. For the grand theft auto. Okay? So, now it is your turn. Now you will tell me, okay? You will tell me why you are here?
Ah, yes. The murder.
What kind of project?
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
Twenty six months.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
What's the other one?
You like to make the boundaries disappear. It's not only the money, is it, George? The adventure is part of the victory. It's the thrill, ah?
In my country, I am a magico. A man with a dream. A man on the rise. To take nothing and make it something, okay? I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish. That is why I am in your country. Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream. Do you have a dream, George?
Yes, you have a dream. And maybe you accomplish your dream. But yet you failed. Why?
No, my brother.
You failed because you had the wrong dream.
No, no. That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap. In Medellin, we buy for six thousand dollars a kilo. IN Miami, we sell for sixty.
Oh my G d.
Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ.
Getting it here is no problem. Trust me. I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply? How much can we get?
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
Fifteen hundred. We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
Great. I love the Bahamas.
Diego? It's George.
Yeah, I'm out.
How are we doing?
Do we need a plane? How does this work? When do I see you?
But you must. It's the only way.
George, are we gonna do this or not?
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
I know.
That's my George, always thinking.
I need you to go to Miami.
Bad news, George. I'm in Colombia.
Touche.
Pablo used his influence. Now, George, watch what you say. Everybody hears everything. A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America. Life is cheap here, you know? No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
Right. Now who is the person in California? The connection?
Who? I need to know. Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
Fuck it. I'm not counting it again.
I don't give a shit. Close enough.
And keep only forty percent? No thanks.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
I'm very angry with you, George. Very angry. You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife? A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this. You and me.
What do I do with it? Nothing. It's for peace of mind. It's for the principle.
This is not the time, Diego.
Derek Foreal. Derek Foreal. Derek fucking Foreal. Alright? The answer to all your dreams. Are you happy now?
Of course we are brothers. Why do you say that? You hurt me, George.
I did not.
No, I never. I would not do that, George. Never.
Cocaine? How much?
In how long? A week?
Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12 lead e. k. g. and start an i. v. stat! This man is having a heart attack.
Mexico.
Barbara.
Thank you. Have you been getting the money I sent you?
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Yes. Of course. But, I'm talking about that ring. It's something else. Let me tell you.
Who's the cheapskate?
The man who gives us the airplanes. The man from America. The mafia. Chicago. Boom boom. Hollywood. You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
Good. Very good. Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country.
Un rata no good. But he could have run, fled the country. Gone to the policia. But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
But, never mind. I am thinking we can do much together. This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business. To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem. And I don't like problems.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
As much as I can give you? Ha ha. Very good. I like that. Come, George. Let us drive. We have much to talk about.
People tell me that I am crazy. That my business will never work in your country. What do you think, George?
I want money.
Freedom.
Yeah, maybe.
Sure.
Keep them coming.
Money.
Diego is my brother.
Diego?
Please. Sit down. We'll drink some scotch.
I see. I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad. You now know who your Brutus is.
It is very difficult. Diego makes me a lot of money. If Diego goes so does the money. You were an excellent teacher, George. When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary. We must remember we have wives, friends, familia. Even familia that has not been born. But sometimes, we must forget as well. I am like you. I must teach the lesson. We want to teach the lesson. But we cannot. We must remember that life is the teacher.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you. It is the teacher.
I'm sorry, George.
Of course, George. We are beautiful. We are brothers. Real brothers. Not like Diego. We started this, George.
I know.
No, Dad. I don't want to... I mean, I just don't want...
I know.
No, Dad. I don't want to... I mean, I just don't want...
Yeah, Dad. I really did. What am I gonna do?
Yeah, you are. I can tell by the way you look at me.
I know. I'm great at what I do, Dad. I mean, I'm really great.
No, it's good. You have a family. It's good if it makes you happy. It's nice to have nice things. Are you happy, son?
You're not going to trial?
Good.
Give it to her, Dad. It'll make her happy.
I meant every word of it.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money? Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money? Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
Do I know you?
Why are you smiling?
I don't know. My name is George.
What is your name?
Put that shit away, they're here.
Pablo said no?
No. These are her first steps. Watch her.
But this is...
Alright.
Where are you going?
Don't touch me. Tell me. Just answer the question. What do I spend? What? How will we live?
Hey, why don't you just put a " I'm doing cocaine " sign on the car. What is your fucking problem?
What?
Fuck you, George. I knew you'd say something like that. Always thinking about yourself.
Yeah. She told me. You walk her to school.
I haven't seen one dollar from you. You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Yeah? I better see some money out of it.
She's getting big. Getting her own ideas.
Is she here? Is she coming?
Yeah.
He wants me to testify? Is that what he's asking me to do?
No, never. Don't even think about that, it's impossible. I love your mother. And you are my heart. Could I live without my heart? Could I?
Well, here I am. See?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
What?
I don't want, alright? It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George. You blew it, now leave me alone.
What do you want from me?
Do what you want, it's a free country.
Yeah, sure, whatever.
What is it? A Disneyland thing?
California, huh?
I don't know. Maybe California.
Yeah. Go out there, check it out, see what it's like. I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday. Thursday after school.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
There's schools in California.
That's right. Three o'clock. Thursday. At your mother's. You and me. It's a date.
I swear. On my life.
I swear on your life.
I didn't mean to...
I love you. I love you so much. You've got to know that. You've got to know.
After everything. After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow. My daughter.
Because she's visiting me.
You're looking at him. We provide the plane, transportation cost, U. S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go. You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment. You assume all the bust risks. We take sixty five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further. If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
They're over at the booth.
I don't give a shit. Split it up. Have a great life. I'm done. I'm out. Starting over. Cheers.
Ha ha ha. You are funny. Really, how much will you be needing?
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast. You take a little and then come back.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well. We must be careful.
Amigo, you bring me fifty thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.
I'm on vacation. On my way back to school.
No, man. I'm too fucked up.
Stoned?
Yeah?
That was it. Seeing Dulli after fourteen years sealed the deal for me. The rest was just details. My end was roughly five hundred thousand. Kristina and I could have a good life for five hundred grand. Start over somewhere. One final score. That's all I needed.
Second name.
Which " district " do you belong to?
Second district... Explain better...
What " group "?
Third group. What's your assignment?
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up... Isn't it true, Ali?
What's happened to you?
What... What must I decide?
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me...
My name is Kader, Ali... Saari Kader... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. And that's why I told you to kill the French policeman: because the French wouldn't have let you do it. If you were with the police you wouldn't have done it.
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
I don't do that kind of thing.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
Of course. As soon as possible.
No. Not you, or any one of us. As long as we are free, the NLF continues to exist in the Casbah. If they manage to take us too, there won't be anything left... And from nothing comes nothing...
But it's not even midnight yet!
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
Yes, a name for the operation.
Let's hope forever.
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
We don't trust you, colonel. Come forward, show yourself.
We'll lower a basket from the window...
I'm sorry, man but I ain't ever heard of no brother dying from gettin'too much pussy.
I want you to hit all the dealers in town. Give them a list of people close to Marsh and see if any of them use. Then I want you to check out a Doctor Alan Paley. He lives up in Roseburg.
I'm trying.
No but I got something.
It's very good because when the D. A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
Because it hasn't all been erased.
What would Joanne Braslow need with an estate attorney? She wasn't even mentioned in Marsh's will.
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing. Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
I don't know.
An inquiry into what?
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
He can remember at least one occasion and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office.
What about the will?
Not sure. I'll have everything you need tomorrow.
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
That's what my report will read.
Any prints on the nasal spray?
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
What induced it?
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Then how did it get into his body?
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A. Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
Thank you, Doctor McCurdy. Your witness.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
What did they argue about?
Did they argue the day before he died?
What was the nature of the argument?
Could you be more specific?
Your witness.
No. Miss Lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions. She doesn't have to sit here and be insulted. So, either you charge her now or we're leaving.
You can't show intent.
You're bluffing. John, it's me, remember? I've known you since your name was Juan Carlos.
Why would she want that?
Suspicions maybe but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
Yeah. Well we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.
Your Honor please!
I didn't hear it.
You don't know what you're talking about.
You've been following me?
The opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view.
Objection! Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
Why did you come by?
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
Thank you.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
What about Miss Lawson?
Tell the court about that, please.
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
How did he look?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
What did Mr. Marsh say?
She was here?
Show me.
How long were you together?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
And how are you now?
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
Why not?
Why do you think she left you?
Can you give the court an example?
She's a woman who is very much aware of her own sexuality. Sometimes I felt she could read my mind. It was uncanny how she knew exactly what I wanted. A few nights before my heart surgery Rebecca woke me. She had handcuffed me to the bed.
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
What happened after that?
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
She was.
Did you ever see her again after that?
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
Why?
What did she say?
And what did you suggest?
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
If necessary I can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence.
Yes.
No.
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
I suggest it never happened.
I mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.
And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Why does she come to you?
What did you prescribe for her?
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
A previous witness stated that she saw Miss Lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on October twenty eighth. According to your records when did you prescribe the drug?
Yes quite easy.
High school?
No.
He did. Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough and well...
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
What about Miss Lawson?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile?
I suppose.
Yes. I suppose it's possible.
That bastard!
I was jealous. Of course I was hurt. He switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with. But I didn't kill him.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
And that he changed his will?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money. That must have made you pretty angry?
Yes.
Dristan nasal spray.
Three fifteen.
P. M.
I don't know.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
Because you were jealous. Because he cut you out of the will. Because you have a cocaine habit to feed because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.
Yes.
To show you this. It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler. He wrote it to me the day after I saw him. He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
No.
I need to ask you a question. What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
I'm not asking for names or specifics. I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Yes.
Yes.
No further questions.
You must have some feeling. Some immediate impression. A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will. And the things that went on in that house. Such wild sex. What kind of picture does that paint?
This is a very small town people here have very straight views on sex.
I am who I am. I can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are. I like sex different I like it wild. That's not a crime. I loved Andrew. We made love together. We made it differently, but we still made love. It was our way. It was private and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice. If I was some middle aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me?
Something like that.
As it pertains to you not me. Did you always know you had different... tastes?
How?
Why not?
Try.
Because somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.
Why didn't you live together?
Is it against the law?
I'm the photographer.
That's not an answer.
Tastes can change.
Hi, Frank.
Yes she did.
No not at the office. I've got a better idea.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
Really?
That seems so far away from who you are now. What happened?
It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it? To let go of what you want?
You and me making love.
No that's what I know you were thinking.
I just left Joanne Braslow. She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
No, I don't have to believe you. The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
Why would she lie?
Don't worry about Paley. He can't touch me. No one can. I've thought it all out.
Rebecca we shattered a man's life in open court.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
You don't need anybody.
No I'm a survivor.
So, sue me. Things have changed. I think you should go home and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Don't push me, Frank. I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite.
Don't listen to him. Can't you see he's trying to turn you against me.
I'm supposed to be on vacation.
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
Well, I guess that makes you the best. Look, Frank she stands to inherit three million dollars. As executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us. All I'm asking you to do is talk to her.
Hey, you know better than that. What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
Because I'm expecting a call.
I know what day it is! Get off the phone.
This is not relaxing.
Really.
If you want me to.
I know. What can I do? He is the boss.
If he files are you going to take the case?
What's she like?
I can think of worse ways to go
Why don't you talk to him now?
No one's asking you not to work. I just think you could make some time for your son.
What's wrong?
Yes.
Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
It's bad enough that you are. It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
Please not now.
I don't know.
It's more involved than that.
You think that's the answer? Sex? Is that what you want? You want me to make love to you?
No, it's not. Now I get to pitch.
Not even if they're a dork?
Six thirty and he was very much alive.
It had to get there somehow.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Well, that's a long time.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white! Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch not two words until the bill came and then he says, " Worth every penny. "
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
I simply can not stand that tone!
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Well, I can help.
No.
Lawyer here?
What problem?
What?!
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
What?
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it. You think she had sex with him?
Don't say that!
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
No, I don't think so. I
That's it!
Well, I'd like to read them.
STOP IT! I want to read them! If you don't want to, then just leave. But don't you push me around like I'm some mule you paid for I already GOT A HUSBAND!
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Then why do you?
I found out who Lucy Delaney is. Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
I bet mom could've helped her.
Not yet. You want to go?
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her " exploring " stage.
Nobody did.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? " What's good enough for mom is good enough for me? "
Carolyn!
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but ya know being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
I'd laugh first then I'd kill them. Make sure they heard me laughing.
She used to be so friendly.
She changed.
Not this kind of heat.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
Don't talk about what you don't know. Besides, she's too young for " the changes. "
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
That must be it. It's a great smell.
Oh. When did you move back?
Oh.
Uh... uh... Umm... long time.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
No, really?
Yeah.
WHAT!
Sure.
Francesca. Robert.
I thought it was funny.
And how long are you here for?
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
About a year and a half.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
I doubt that.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
What's he like?
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Yes. Very clean.
Is the dizziness gone?
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
You have no reason to feel ashamed. You haven't said anything you don't have a right to. And if anybody tells you different you just send them to me.
Okay.
Oh my God... You're blushing.
Then what happened?
Oh you!
" Making pictures. " I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
Why, do you think?
You sound like an artist.
I don't think you're normal.
Why did you stop?
Do you miss it?
You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?
This is your home. It's not nowhere. And it's not dull.
You drink bug repellent?
When?
No. I'm all right. It's working.
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature. " Who wrote that?
I'd appreciate it. I like knowing who I'm stealing from. If you can't create art I think the least you can do is recognize it around you, don't you think? There is...... so much beauty.
Francesca?
Are you all right?
Francesca?
We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
So what happened?
You must get lonely at times.
Woman friends, too?
Why doesn't it scare you?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
But how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
But no one in particular.
But it's not the same.
No, I'm just saying
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
I thought that's what we were doing asking questions.
I already apologized.
... I feel like something's been spoiled now.
Am I interrupting anything?
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
I would love to come for dinner.
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
I'll pick you up.
Okay. See you later.
Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
I understand. That's very kind of you.
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
How about if I set the table?
Would you like a beer for your bath?
No.
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Yes.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Yes.
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
I sat there once. It was hot. Like today. I'd been shopping. I had all these bags around my feet I kept having to move every time the waiter came by...
I bet you could do a book.
Why do you say that?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
What were your parents like?
Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in.
Uh huh. And?
Am I too heavy for you?
Good. More coffee? Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
How do you know what I experience?
Stop it!
What do you want me to say?
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
No. Don't do this.
Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
What about your husband?
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
Where you going?
Now?! It's after eleven.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
It's only four days.
Okay.
I just want to say... I know you had your own dreams. I'm sorry I couldn't give them to you. I love you so much.
Betty.
Okay.
Well, she's... she's real pretty and... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca!
Yes, they are.
Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Some holes can't be filled. Some hungers can't be satisfied.
I know damn well she's there.
I don't.
Hell no!
Take my advice. And shoot that dog. Or let me.
Died there? How?
Take my advice. Get the hell out of there. It's a bad place. Always has been.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Keep smokin', fool.
Some flies? I think this qualifies as way more than " some. "
" This is the story of Jimmy Bones / Black as night and hard as stones / Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam / Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand... " There's the switchblade and there's the diamond. Don't know where the deuce is parked.
Pat's right. It'll be fun.
Well, go find his lazy ass. I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome.
Anywhere but here.
You wouldn't know a mule if it bit you in the ass. And personally, I don't need a mule. I got a Lexus. And nobody gave it to me
Clean your mouth, or I will. Those boys had no business messing down there. Go places you're not meant to be that's what you get.
Yeah, and it took some doing to get out of there. Just be glad I did and you can start life from here instead of down there.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street. Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
Bones.
But things change. You gotta think ahead.
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty dollar bag.
Those'fools'are my people.
I said, no thanks.
Let me see your hand.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
No baby. I'm serious. Cancel that meeting. I got more fruit that needs checking. Come home with me now.
But.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this. Not just big. BIG. Like big business big. Big corporation big. Big government big. Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands. Nothing but net.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes. That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal. Big houses, legit business...
You always told me, it's a dog eat dog world.
Time like this, is that what you really want to know? How I got the fuck in here?
And the hell everybody else, right?
You know I can't.
You got a vision, girl. Just like I got. Just like my momma had. And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures. That's just wasted time.
They seemed alright. Bring a little life to that old building.
Have you ever been inside?
And what's that?
I lied.
Please. It's for your own good.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Your father. He was your father.
Sure, if it was really him. But it isn't that simple. Jimmy's body died a long time ago. And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Eddie Mack, that cop. And Jeremiah. And even when he's done, who knows. He won't be satisfied. Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge he just wants more. Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
Like what? I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight. But no more than you do. We're not witches. I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it. Maybe we all do.
Fine. Maybe I got nothing to lose.'Cept you.
Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.
How do you know?
Why?
What else does she say?
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B. S. And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us? Fingers rotting off?
Lucky thing.
The dead get out?
And you believe her?
He probably thinks he's saving you from something. I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
No, I want to stay with you guys. But I can't. I mean I'm not ready.
Patrick, he's...
Here!
Yeah, but you got to come the rest of the way on foot. Leave your car and walk over here.
Where is it?
No one'll ever come here. Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
Bullshit! Bullshit!! You're selling it back! That's an order!
You could have had it done. You didn't want us there.
From what?
Bullshit, Dad. Don't front me. For once. Just tell me the truth. I came from there, too.
I saw your face. You knew that place. You knew those people.
Dead? I don't think your past is dead. It's alive. And it bites.
Don't call me that.
I been watching you. You done good. Invested wisely. Respectable businessman now. Just like you always wanted.
No reason to get nasty. Yeah, I've stayed in the organization. But then again I never got the percentage you did.
Maybe so. Maybe so. But that ain't why I came to see you. You sold the building.
Don't shit a shitter. Our building. What did you call it? His'tomb'? We had an agreement. You were supposed to sit on it. Not sell it
Well, somebody bought it. That's what I heard.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago. They could never connect it to us.
No time for eightball. I got your tip.
Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
12 year olds. They scare easy. Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash. Come with me.
Oh, no. Please don't make me go by myself. I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night? Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin'on Blackstone last night!
How many times I told you, no psycho shit. There gonna be psycho shit, I'm the one that does it.
That's all we did, steal their ride.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
Maybe I oughta open a couple holes in that head and let all them voices out. You'll feel better, I promise.
I was planning on waiting until I got the place cleaned out, but like the man says, carpe diem.
You haven't?
He was a local legend back in the'70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: " This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones / Black as night and hard as stone... "
Why don't y'all check out the rest? I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up. Warm this place up, you'll see. It has serious potential.
Why not? He eats everything else.
Post toasted's more like it.
Gonna be le hot shit. Pardon my Francais. Dance club. The Resurrection Brothers play there. Heard of them?
You're pretty black to be growing up in Rossmore Park.
The blood is still there. We just gotta figure out where.
Moe's terms.
Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.
Here, put this in his mouth.
No, no, Caesar. Not now.
The money I bet it was nothing to get it clean, after you made such a fucking big deal...
Admit what?
Open the case!
You don't need a key.
What are you talking about?
Where is it?
The money!
Where is it?
Stay away!
Gimme the gun.
Give it to me.
All part of the business.
I'm sorry, Christ, I thought... it's fucking dark in here.
What? It ain't no big fuckin'deal. I know who Don hires. Did you know he did time himself?
You're right. You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to. I just hope you understand you're among good people here.
I told them to run it through the cycles. But I guess Gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up.
Don't be silly, Caesar. It'll take five minutes.
They just left, didn't they?
That doesn't make any sense.
Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.
It couldn't have been.
It's impossible!
So what?! So fucking what? Use your head, Violet. The money is gone. Gino is coming here to get it. You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss hole son stole it! Is that what you think? I don't. You know what I think? I think I'm a dead man. I'm one in the brain. That's what I think!
Violet, please!
Goddammit, Violet! Would you just leave me the fuck alone! Please! Leave! Now!
No. Johnnie's got it. All I got to do is get it back.
He didn't have that much time. He had to pick up Gino. I bet you he's got it with him. I bet it's in the car.
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case. He wants me to hand the case to Gino. Then there is no doubt it was me. Gino will put a bullet in me himself. But it ain't going to happen. I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me! Not like this! No way!
I need you...
Violet, I won't let you leave.
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't.
I've seen the way he looks at you. He's always wanted you. Maybe two million dollars finally bought you.
Shut up, Violet! This is between me and Johnnie.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
No I didn't. Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here. Then they never showed up.
I don't know. We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.
They're just cops. Stall them as long as you can.
I don't know. it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time. Let's get out of here.
Who are you going to call?
Shut up, Violet!
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Shut up, Violet.
You murdered Gino!
Bullshit, you killed him. Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
But everybody is all right.
Now you listen to me, asshole, I know your gun is behind the bar...
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
You know he would have done you, too.
Caesar, you don't know shit.
What? How about a drink?
Another time.
Where is it?
When I reach ten, then I'll start with you.
I could be lying.
Mickey, why is Johnnie here? You know how I feel about that fucking psycho.
No. I don't know where they are. I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Okay, sure, Mick.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
That Violet is one nice lady. Wish someone would help me relax.
We went over to Johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, Bad.
Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing.
Why'd you move all the furniture around?
Fuck it, I don't need the key.
You did the right thing.
I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?
Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back.
A favor?
Oh, I'm sorry
Are they really?
No, no trouble. There's other work to do.
Yeah.
' 63 Chevy.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
Oh, really.
Caesar is your husband?
My pleasure.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
Yeah, come on in.
A beer?
I have a tattoo, would you like to see it?
Because I want to. I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.
No.
I wanted to apologize.
No.
How did you meet him?
He's a launderer?
How long have you been with him?
Five years is a long time.
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
My cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught. She was always more honest than me.
I'm glad you did.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
What are you afraid of?
I don't understand?
We're not that different, Corky.
Because it's the truth.
Oh no, she's nothing like you. She's a lot smarter than you.
I know what I am. I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
I don't.
What you heard wasn't sex.
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex. Not real sex. But they're wrong. I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
Work.
You mean Shelly?
No. Shelly knows what I am. He saw me in a bar with another woman.
Yes.
That's what he told himself. But it wasn't even about me, it was about Caesar. He wanted what Caesar had. That's how they are. I understand them.
Maybe he did. He would brag to me all the time. He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him. Not like I do.
He's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be.  But Mickey doesn't like it like they do. I suppose that's why he's good at it.
You made a choice once. Do you think you would make that same choice again?
If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
I am, but...
I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are. It would have been easy to set Shelly up. You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment.
I'm just making a point. You have no idea what you're asking. How much trust two people need to do something like this.
I think...
Then what? Exactly.
What?
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Why?
Who is Gino?
That's his brother.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Sweet Jesus.
What happened?
Has Caesar ever seen him?
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
What did Gino drink?
Any bodyguards?
Fine.
Shit! Oh shit!
The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch. Trust.
Why?
You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
I think we're going to find out.
Believes it! Jesus, it's driving him crazy. He wants to kill him. I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do. I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
What if he doesn't run?
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
Okay, all right.
I was so afraid you...
How'd it go?
... Me neither.
Caesar, come here. Sit. We talk now. You too, Johnnie.
Don't worry about Caesar. I'll handle Caesar. You just get out of here, okay?
Oh my God. Was anyone hurt?
I know you will.
Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get out, you know? Get away from all of this.
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone. Was this Treadstone?
Yes.
And what if I couldn't do that?
We're exploring every possibility. We are in pursuit. How much more do you want me to tell you?
No. Pursuit ends when we know exactly where he is.
This is an operations desk.
Turn? To who? Where does he turn? What does he have to offer? He's got nothing. He's a killer. He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
This doesn't go upstairs.
Inside the house?
Forget it.
We don't know what we're into!
You're not doing shit. You're so scared you can't even think.
I can't call it off. He's not responding. Get out of my way.
What do you mean?
Treadstone?
Yes.
What is Treadstone?
I think so.
What do they want me to do?
Why?
I don't know.
I know you've been trying to kill me.
So now you know.
That's all I get?
I don't think so.
Jason Bourne is dead.
Keep it.
That'll be their second worst mistake.
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea. How does it feel to be dead?
Get the kids out!
We thought you were gone for good.
Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it? Cutthroat.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred and seventy five foot pleasure cruiser. I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
We also thought we hadn't heard from you we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking. Our offices were broken into vandalism mostly shortly after we last spoke.
I need a ride out of here.
Please. I don't want to scare you.
I've got a situation here and
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
You don't want the police any more than I do.
For twenty thousand dollars.
Okay. Twenty thousand. Ten now. Ten there.
Wait up just wait up
I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home.
And I don't get hurt. I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
What if I say no?
I don't know. Smile. Sneeze. Something. You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris. Fuck it, I don't know... What kind of music do you like?
What does that mean?
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
No. No, I mean, I really don't know who I am. I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago. I'm serious.
Look, go ahead... put the radio on...
That's what I'm saying.
When you think of it, before the ship before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
Well, this is great. I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
You could put it together
What are you talking about?
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
Okay, so you're a victim.
Lots of people have guns. You're American. Americans love guns.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
You're paranoid. You were shot. It's natural.
We're about an hour away.
You were tired. Here... For twenty thousand I like to throw in breakfast. So what do you dream about?
No. No. Go around. Keep going...
Jason...
Anytime.
Look, you could come up. Or you could wait if you want. I could go check it out. You could wait.
How could I forget about you? You're the only person I know.
See. It's starting to come back, yeah? You mind if I take a bath?
Quiet quiet
Just
Marie, just just stay there! just
Let me do this, okay?
He went out the window why? why would someone do that?
He came to kill us.
You knew he was coming.
I trusted you.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
He had my picture! He knew I was here! He came here to kill us!
Oh, Jesus...
But the police
We'll explain it
There's two of us we'll tell them we'll just
We'll tell them what happened
It's a company... MPG Capital.
What is that?
What does that mean? Jason, what does that mean? Jason, please... who is he?
So what are we doing?
Yes. That's who I want to be.
I won't let that happen.
Xxxxxx
What about you?
Yes.
You have ID?
He run away often?
Get everyone down in the basement.
Wait a minute
Miss Kreutz, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States
It's not the source of the information that's important here
Miss Kreutz, please
So now you're asking for a student visa?
Tell him we're busy.
But it was him
It doesn't matter now. We've just got to be the first ones there. Get everybody up. I want them all activated.
That'll solve all our problems.
You're American. I thought so. From your teeth the dental work
You're on a boat. A fishing boat. Italian flag. We're out of Vietri. It's the cold that saved you. The water. The wounds are clean. I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay. It's clean.
You we're lost at sea. They pulled you out. Who are you? You were shot two bullets in the back. You understand me? Who are you?
Trouble with your air conditioning.
... fix themselves.
... ampered. with it, Spoor.
Tuttle!... mumble! You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
... sod you, stupid twit.
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin threaded solenoid control. It's either that or a new washer.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
We know that too. You've come to the right place.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day... but, tomorrow is another one
You must save the day.
Oh... Thank you very much, mother, but actually
Oh, right...
Yes, it was... very nice... thank you.
Too late? That's for me to say.
Gillian Layton?
I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Long time no see!
Problem? No problem yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job rewarded
Me? if I'm worried about anyone, it's you. What happened to you, Sam? You were the brightest of us
You are late.
Sam, your life is going wrong let your friends tell you Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed
Triplets.
Remember how they used to stick out?
Mr Helpmann!
Are you officer 412 / L?
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
What?
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting. My tailor,... well worth the investment.
Layton! Oh shit!
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
How much do you know?
Enough though, eh?
Christ! You do know it all!
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47 / 215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58 / 732 was pulled in by mistake.
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
He's a compulsive heating engineer. A maverick ex Central Service repair man with a grudge against society. Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of the wood, I think. At least we will be when I get this Layton woman under arrest.
Er... no.
Er... but I would've found out anyway.
Tell me about Layton.
A terrorist?
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Look, about the Layton woman maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
Why? Hell, not for any reason...
Out of kindness.
So what are you going to do about her?
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
And you're mine.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
They weren't at school with us.
Take her off the list.
Say it was a mistake.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
Trust me.
She's innocent, Jack she's done nothing wrong.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
Yes we have, Jack!
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.
How could you do this to me?
How do you think I feel? You shit!
Shut up! This is a professional relationship!
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
Yes.
Stamped?
Where do I get it stamped?
You think these are tits don't you?
I bet you'd like to touch them?
Well don't. You're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive! And if you don't stamp this form I'm going to blow the place up!
Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
How can I act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm?
Please!
Us. Them. I don't know... just get going.
Oh. But... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
I don't know. Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Why?
Why not?
Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me?
It does doesn't it?
No, really.
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
We've got both.
They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Who is this war against, Sam?
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Well, almost... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5. 00 every day.
Turn around!
They'll be there waiting.
Security.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
Yes... but, this is real. Now, stop!
Will you please turn back.
Turn!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
We? Don't blame me!
Shit! The house is on fire!
What?
Yes. Come out, I know you're in there
Please, Jill... I love you.
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry.... It must he something very special.
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
What happened to you after...
No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you... I thought...
Yes.
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Oh my God, a mistake!
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Oh, good!
But if they did promote you
Would you really, Sam?
You've been promoted.
Tuttle?
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Hang on.
Try next of kin.
Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
Don't mention it. See you later.
Can I forget it?
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ / 3 do you?
I know that.
I never signed the form.
What! Shit!
Yes... No... I don't, know.
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha! My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
What?
You want to take my console into your office?
I'll tell you what.... You tell me what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of a whizz on this thing.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
What? Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
Oh yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
How long will she he away?
You remember Samuel, my son.
We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
It's something for executives.
By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.
Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
I want to talk to him.
Not now... please
Er, don't you want to search me?
My I. D. cards.
But I could be anybody.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
Thank you, Dawson.
I don't know which numero.
Not... as such...
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
It's a 27B / 6, what did you think it was?
Ha!!
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
The pace?
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Can you fix it?
What do they want you or?
No, no, that's impossible.
Thanks for the translation. What's your name? Nombre?
Es impossible.
It's a miracle.
In that time, you ever have sex?
No underwear?
He's not a cop, he's a medic. I'm CY Coates.
Where is she?
She asked me to pick her up.
I better just go in and see her.
Red Death? Tell me something, Frank does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
Sleep is all stress reduction. Here. You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need. Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frank for my health? You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
What about Kanita?
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot.
No. He's dead.
He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
IB Bangin.
No, no medicine!
Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it.
Sure, sure, give go.
The pitch, high heater. Bucky knows what's coming. He steps in, smash, over the green monster.
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
We'd better go outside. Quickly.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
He's dead, huh?
I think this place stinks.
Did you see my father?
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?
I'd take her, but then who would stay here?
I'll be right down.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
Sleeping.
You can't kill my father that easy. He'll fight forever. Like with me: hasn't talked to me in three years. But it's okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you.
He's better.
Not as good as Nino's.
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
Like everybody else except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents...?
You married?
Five years.
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
I think I'd remember that.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
Sure.
Don't seem so bad to me.
Okay.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
Promise you won't go inside.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault.
Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him? That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
Come on up.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here.
She loves me the way no woman ever has.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
God help us, he's hungry too.
You don't know the first thing about rule number three, cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule. Come on, let's go look at some hookers. The Kit Kat will be letting out. Don't ever call a junkie whore a crackhead. They get real mad.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
Three legs.
Backup?
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I just saved a little baby boy look.
I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding.
I'll drink to that.
Greatest job in the world.
You can't leave me now.
What do you think?
The family know?
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
No.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
The brakes are shot.
You okay?
That's all right, we're not meant to do Oh tonight. Something is going to happen. I can feel it.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.
C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!
Let's get in a fight, then.
That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die.
I don't know let's break some windows.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
Do it!
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right. Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
Turn here. You missed it. The Chink is on 3rd.
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on.
You know what. The radio.
Don't push it, Larry.
They'll just keep calling.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
Yeah, you're right.
Keep it to yourself.
Oh, stop it.
You have the job you have...
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Okay, let's drop it. I didn't mean I'd take a test for you I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
Okay.
Fifty, right?
Nothing. I think you really blew the lid off nookie.
It just might not work for me because of our different approaches.
Your coat jacket is rising up in back.
Just don't physically... Fantastic tip fantastic.
I'll find some copy. Be right back.
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that. You don't want to look shifty, do you?
And the left side of your face is the good one. Go again. And try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence punch one idea a story. Punch come on
No. Don't worry about it.
Impossible. There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
London.
I don't think so.
Hold it down, okay?
Okay.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
That's your full name?
I might as well ask you the questions on tape. Is that all right?
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Eventually rising to...
Which would you prefer?
Stop the tape, okay. Forget it, Ellen. Let's call security and get him out.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now. But he's not ever gonna change. He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie. He feels no different. He also bought a brand new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies  sic .
Because nobody invites a bad looking idiot to their bedroom.
Okay. I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
I'd give anything if that were true.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive? If needy were a turn on?
Oh, God. Back it, Bobbie Bobbie?
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Of course.
To the pan of the supplies boxes
Watch?
You're welcome. Sow how does it feel to... I know you gotta go Me too. We're very busy here.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Yes.
Did you bring your grey suit?
It's not a date. It's co workers going to a professional conclave.
Yes.
Me too... Hey... if it gets dull a little before 11: 00, drop by the studio.
If... if not, I'll have the tape... I'll wait for you at my apartment.
No.
Did it really go well?
Do you feel good about it?
Do others feel that you did well?
Then what was good about it?
Aaron, will you tell me?
What do you mean, flop sweat? you're making too much out of it... I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
Stop kidding. I want to know what happened.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
I have to be somewhere.
I don't know. I may be in love with him.
Yeah. Well... I think it is important for you too. Sit down.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
I know you care about him. I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around? Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail. No. I'm semi serious here. He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing... he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit. And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen. And he'll get all the great women.
How?
I just found out. You didn't say anything to me? You just resign? Will you meet me now? No, now! I'm going away tomorrow. Please.
Tell me the God's honest truth are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.
Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.
Yes.
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
I'm going to take it.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
No Don't worry about it. Let's do this.
In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J. D. Singer's return from war. Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war. But it was the civil war in Angola and he was in it for the money.
I'll tell you what. I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.
Yeah
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased. All right?
Upper management thinks you're dull.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen... but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road you should look into it.
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
I could do it this Saturday everyone wants off for the Correspondents'Dinner.
Prepare what? You have Saturday's news handy?
Thanks.
The cost efficient reporter.
How long has it been since you've been home.
It depends on how big a news day it is.
Norman Rockwell's'Homecoming. '
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
No, I don't. He happens to deserve the credit. He's right here.
Did you hear what I just said do you have that? Take a breath.
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
Let me hear it!
Just a two second dissolve.
Because...
How do I get out of here?
You talked me into it.
Yes. That's right.
No... no.
What?
Yes. How do you know?
Oh, please. So they were really impressed with you at work.
I see the change in you I see it.
I wish it were you giving the story.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
Okay. And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information. Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
Anchor?
I broke up with my roommate He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
... good bye then.
Well, who knows. Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me'Don't be afraid to be wonderful. '
It's Paul.
I could use somebody to talk to on a day like this. Sorry. Go ahead.
You don't have to finish tonight.
Finish quickly. I don't want you getting obsessive about these things. Good night.
Why so glum?
Go ahead.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
As long as that's your only problem you're...
I'll just have to try harder. I don't know. I will. I will. I will. I will.
That would be great. It better help. What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
It's not opinion.
Thank you. They hated me. I don't hate them.
I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to. I have about two thousand questions for you.
Nooo. If I could just have a roll, I'd be okay.
Yes. My room is down here I'm not tired. Do you want to keep talking?
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports. I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
I don't write.
One year... almost one year.
I agree with you you're not qualified. So get qualified. You can insist on being better prepared. You don't have to just leave it as...'I don't write. I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks. '
Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau. So I'll probably see you at work. Sorry.
I can't believe I'm really here. No kidding. If you're through work now
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn. I'd really a lot appreciate it... if...
You make me nervous. Anyway if I can pick your brain
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
Okay.
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work. I have it cold, confirmed. They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Okay, billion... right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted and I want you.
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
Indescribable you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before I needed it. There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex.
I'll wait for you till seven.
There's no gang in there We were the last ones.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
I'll be the judge of that.
I'll get you through. Move and smile. And smile and move...
Too many smart people in one room it's not healthy...
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
Yes.
It's not important.
What pills did you take? You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic. Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
No. Are you going to the Correspondents'Dinner on Saturday?
No. Were you going to you?
Maybe I'll get off work. I'd like to go.
We can go together.
Yeah.
Me!
This is hysterical.
Right, right Isn't she fun to tease?
What?
That's not it.
No. I'll see you at your apartment as soon as I can.
He might be weird he can talk more freely if I go alone why's that so hard to understand?
Okay. Sorry. Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me.
I can't get away just yet. I'm at Aaron's.
I'm not sure. It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Uh huh.
Okay. Good night.
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
No. Did he really?
What?
That's so perfectly... It really makes me feel a little faint... Whooo.
Sorry. I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse. This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look, I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job. I have a week to get to my job. Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this.
That's more than'yes'that's'you bet. '
We disagree on how God awful it was. Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
I got promoted for things like that.
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
This is a one way argument. We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it we'll come home. If you don't go? Well, that's a much bigger deal. I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here. The plane's boarding. You're good at deadline. Here's your ticket.
I'm leaving now. Gate 43.
I knew what you meant.
It's okay.
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
It's better when you let me say it.
I thought for ol'Cliff here Look at you? You're more adorable than your pictures. Look what I got for you.
Well, we should talk. You going to have time for dinner? I'd like you to meet Lila.
Okay... It's so good to see you.
Ummm it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
You're saying stay away from him.
Look, I'm junior man and it's your beat.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
I'd be glad to help. For  50 an hour.
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Yeah.
Uh huh.
Are you nervous, Walter?
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you...
Are you a virgin?
Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.
Not really. One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
You know it. I'm out of here.
What did he do?
What's it called?
Let's see it.
You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
Oh yeah?
Sorry...
All about me...
I'm gonna make the most wildest wittiest things you ever seen... gonna make big statues and li'l statues, tall statues n'short statues...
Are you ready?
I know. But I wanted to talk to you.
Oh, I don't know. Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Of course I do!
You just can't be sorry! I wanna I wanna marry you!
Walter... I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get... together. You know what I mean?
Because... We're just friends. That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it. I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Oh sure, let's string along poor Walter, see how far it will take us!
I've been thinking... Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Would you let me make... a statue of you?
There's... a body inside that statue!
It was.
Don't worry it's a non dairy sauce made from soy milk.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish. Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Oh come on! Even you can see its value.
Why don't you cover it up, Walter!
You're right. We should build a collection first.
Yeah then you could unload sell this stuff for a lot more.
You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know? I'm an artist. I'm not like a banker, you know. Like I create.
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
I mean, screw them, you know? I'm just gonna go right on creating'cause it comes from here you know?
Now what kind of statue was that?
Let's check out the scene.
No man I'm on my own plane.
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil. Maybe he started taking it.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Well do some looking around the room. I see cups, ashtrays let's go...
Huh?
Yeah.
Got carried away, huh?
Sure!
Well I don't know
Look, go home and... work on something. Make another cat.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
Good night Walter.
They are?
You didn't mean to what?
You might talk too much.
Maxwell! He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry! Listen, you've got to stop right away! I'm beginning to feel responsible!
Never mind...
Well invite the critics, and the art collectors... we'll tell them...
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out bidded. I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
What do you want for it? Two thousand? Three thousand?
Listen to me... I don't want to lose this piece
Listen to me, listen to me... I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something. This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands. Are you listening to me?
Yes, you have. Can I come in?
Did you see my cat?
You can cut the crap.
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Possession of narcotics isn't something we take lightly, you understand?
I'm not looking to pinch you! I don't care about you, or the girl. But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear. Now!
Who's the head honcho! Who's providing the smack connection!
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse! Junk! Heroin!
Oh, yeah. It can get real expensive.
Good ol'mild mannered Walter! Give it up. It doesn't fly with me.
Wait a minute! What'd I do?
I didn't do nothing wrong! That was Mayolia's! I didn't ask her for it. I don't know about any
Wait a minute I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
I ain't going no place with you!
Relax!
NO YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME DON'T SHOOT
Well I'm overjoyed.
I worked in one of them. Back in Alaska.
Call me... Maxwell.
Suit yourself.
It would imply you could not succeed on your ability alone!
I don't! But fifty thou? That's not money, that's manna!
Your work, the layers of irony.
With Dead Cat?
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you. I want to be warmed by it.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
You don't have to do anything!
Let it inspire you. Maybe it will let you think of me.
Shut up! You let him have it!
Cheer up. You may still.
I don't know. But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
Coach knows what abs are?
Yes!
Andy!
Wrong answer! No prize.
We're looking at a dog, possible coffee...
They're all the same! They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human. I hate them.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely. Please, God.
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Utterly. Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know. Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt
I'm fine.
The sun! It burns! It burns!
I'm hungry.
Yes.
Wheels?
Which way did she go?
My mom doesn't go anywhere. She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin.
Something like that.
Oh. Who's in it? I know what it is. It's what's on instead of the movie.
Mmmnkay.
Come on, what was it?
Where were you last night? I called your house like four times.
I'm here with Jenny.
No, you didn't. When?
You broke up with my machine?
You left me a message?
What?
Is that your car?
You want some water or something?
They were vampires, weren't they?
God! Unbelievable. Vampires.
Well, stay here tonight.
Where are you gonna go?
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything. I definitely didn't expect this.
It's weird. I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place. I couldn't even fit on the swings. Everything just looked so small. I'm sorry. I'm babbling.
You sure?
Mmkay.
You know, you saved my life. And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.
Why'd you come back?
Thanks.
Who?
Cool. I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches. What do you need?
Dress, huh? What for?
Come again?
Second word... sound like'dance'.
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
It's not a mixer. It's the senior dance. And it's important. You wouldn't understand.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
He did what he was supposed to.
Right. I'm the chosen one. And I choose to be shopping.
That's me.
Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
You're staying here. Some of them might not come after me. If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Who's afraid? Besides me, I mean.
You're the boss, boss. I just thought maybe we should wait.
I really can't. Besides, it's pretty interesting.
Like what?
Please. It's so'91.
Well, where?
Cafe Blase.
Get a boob job.
Buffy, what is your sitch? You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax Bracket; it's too weird.
Oh my God you're having an affair.
Kimberly, it's a dance. It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.
You look way pretty, Kim.
Am I in trouble or something?
What are you talking about?
Why?
My birthright? You mean, like a trust fund?
Wait a minute. My birthright is in the graveyard? Later not.
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you. My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
Chosen to go to the graveyard? Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
Time to do what?
Let me get this straight. You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
Does Elvis talk to you? Tell you to do things? Do you see spots?
I don't know. It was... There was a big gram or something. And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
Oh, my God. I never told anybody about this. I remember the one about the peasant, too. God, there's a bunch. Is this, like channeling or something.
Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.
None of your business. God.
All right. What do we do now?
Skip it.
Why do you keep saying that?
A Vampire King? You mean like Dracula?
Oh, him.
What?
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town. I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here? That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
Great. First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate. Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Uh... gym.
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky. I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs? They're like the mighty oak. It's not a look.
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Sporting events, yeah.
Here?
Okay.
No you don't have to
No. You don't do anything. I do it.
But you threw a knife at my head!
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay? I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires! I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die. It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell. And then you come along... and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
I don't think you understand the full implications of
Put your head back.
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
Toasty. Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
If I say'no'does that make me a bad person?
My nails.
Same one.
And the alley was a mistake. Never corner yourself like that. If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now. One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
Oh, wonderful. My secret weapon is PMS. That's just great. Thanks for telling me.
You are such a wet.
A wet! Didn't I just kill that vampire? I think I did. I didn't see you killing any vampires. You were too busy playing'Beat the Clock'.
Aren't I, like the chosen one? The one and only? The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me? Like, ever?
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down. It's totally not your color. I don't think you have a color.
Oh, fuck you!
What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
How can you keep doing this?
Watchers?
I wish you would.
I'm curious, is all.
And it makes it worse when I die, right?
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Merrick. You made a joke. Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down? I know it hurts the first time.
We call them zippers. They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Because you clash, Merrick. You clash with everything. I mean you might as well go around with a sign,'Slayers trained her.'Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
Well, you're on my turf now. You're just gonna have to trust me.
Another distraction. It's not right.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it. Your fate.
All right.
Oh, I'll be there all right. I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
Football is my life.
Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador. Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway. Ooh!
Good enough!
No. It was mondo bizarro.
Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
B'bye.
You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
Later for it.
Have you guys seen Jeffrey? The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
So very much.
Yes, I'm sure they do. This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
Swear to God.
Why? Why me?
Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan. He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth. They are a plague upon us.
You are much more.
What are you grinning at? You think I was scared?
You think so?
Good.
Make me a woman! Yes! Make me a woman!
Okay, let's go.
Probably was. What do you suppose she was doing out there.
You're kidding.
Oh, my God! Ouch! No wonder you quit.
I'm sorry. I'm Pike. This is Benny.
Hey, wait a minute...
Well, look who's here.
I'm, like, yelling at her,'What are you doing?'And she's going'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'Way mental.
You're so out of it. You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee
Except for Prom.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
No... You want me to give him a message?
All right. Take care of yourself.
Hey. What should I do if I see Benny?
You said " Crash ".
You said " Crash ".
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin'like that...
God, I never thought of that.
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain. These'll help move things to the right side.
They did when they were in the Carolina League.
Sorry. You look great. I'm totally exhausted.
Catch?
Which nostril am I breathing through?
There are two important psychic conduits called the " pingala " and the " ida ". The pingala starts with the left testicle and ends at the right nostril.
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball. And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
Right. Okay, fire a couple in there.
He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.
Gimme the God damn ball!
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey
Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?
Just till I lose.
No.
How'bout a back rub?
I'll tuck you in.
I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie...
I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
Well he calls it the Bermuda Triangle. He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
He didn't mean it nasty. He said that gettin'lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do especially like that.
I knew it you're seducing me!
I think you're real cute.
You're exotic and mysterious and cute that's why I better leave.
What'd he say?
He did?
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me. I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit... I mean I'm getting it
Crash says I gotta quit worrying about him c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do
How can I possibly thank you?
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh don't think too much.
You didn't get " lured ". Women never get lured. They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it " I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions ".
That's better. Got the radar ready?
I don't dance.
I'll learn. C'mon
Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction. There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
G'night.
I'm not interested yet.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
Young men are uncomplicated. And he's not " dim ". He's just inexperienced. My job is to give him " life wisdom " and help him make it to the major leagues.
But they're nice hips. I looked up your records You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great!
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
No. Please.
Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around Great deal. You get to write self indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing So what do you really want? You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic? Or do you want a guy?
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing
He's confused
Don't you think I'm pretty?
I think of you and the " boy " all the time.
And he's right! A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often. You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties then you are! And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
And now you wanta teach me?
I doubt that.
I thought you wanted an " uncomplicated " boy?
And as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
Annie, I think you should leave.
Thurman Munson. He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody it was beautiful... And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition! So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home. Don't you see? If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!
It's possible.
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
Why not?
It doesn't work like that. God, you're gorgeous. Want to dance?
Salem, Massachusetts? Where all the witches were?
Not yet. It takes years of practice...
Annie
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of'em... but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics... I don't wanta think about nothing... I just wanta be.
Three fourteen? Hmmm... Look't those thighs, Jackson
It says he's not bending his back on his follow through.
That's what I been telling everybody! Wanta dance?
Oh both of you, of course...
When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch. Shh. I love this part.
You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All Stars.
Shh, shh... " They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them and charge them "
You a God damn witch?
Will that work for me?
I'm 0 for 16! Gimme some of that shit.
God damn It, Jack, he still ain't touched the plate.
Did you call me a cocksucker?
You missed the tag!
I didn't spit on you!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you? I'll run you!
Try it! Go ahead. Call me a cocksucker!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
You're outta here!
Don't think.
" To announce your fucking presence with authority "? This guy's a first ball fastball hitter. He's looking for heat.
Awright, meat, give him your heat.
An'he scrambled the son of a bitch. Having fun yet?
He did know.
I told him.
What do I got?
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt you need a curve ball. In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
Yep.
" Naw "? There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
You're through with one night stands?! What do you want?
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
Why?! I'm finally throwin'the damn thing where I want to.
You're the boss.
What do I gotta do?
Of course. That's the point. " I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub. "
Write, write " I just wanta give It my best shot and, Good Lord willing, things'll work out. "
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you. Let's have a drink and forget this
Why am I a fuck?
You're a great catcher.
No.
If ya get in a fight with some asshole, never hit his with your pitching hand. ya might get injured. That's another lesson for ya now quit fucking around and help me up.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon. D'you understand that?
You will. Look, Nuke these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile don't worry about it. Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat. That's the secret. You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
No. Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
Maybe you do. Y'know I'm starting to like this game baseball's a helluva good way to make a living.
You can keep going to the ballpark and keep gettin'paid to do it. Beats hell outta working at Sears.
Take the first shot at me.
Hit me in the chest with this...
Don't try me.
No way.
She's playing with my mind.
No. If I screw up, I wanta do it alone. I'll call.
Dad if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it. I gotta run
No.
You can do anything you want. Hop in.
No. The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
Struck out eighteen...
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Eight and sixteen?! How'd we ever win eight? Jose, what's this sign?
It's a miracle.
I'm getting too old for this game.
Okay...
Check it out.
I put in a word for you with the organization told'em I thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday... Might be an opening at Salem next year
Who ain't?
Ain't here.
Your breaking ball's getting better but ya need a change up.
Well, I'd rather not say.
Don't tell him I told you he'd break my neck.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin'county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin'sick of it.
Phil, I can understand. You're in the finances, you're upstairs, but you are not on the floor. I got thousands of players. I got five hundred dealers. They're all lookin'to rob me blind, twenty four hours a day. I have to let them know I'm watching all the details, all the time; that there is not one single thing I will not catch as I am over here.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done.
That's right.
Uh, I I'd... I'd like to answer answer that at this time.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
You were wandering around.
You were wandering around.
You were wandering around.
You were in the m You were in the building.
A powerful man.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin'a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out? And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin'there for thirty years, don't have a license.
You got it.
Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. I guarantee it.
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin'on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help? I mean, the heat he brought down is murder! We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should... get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
I can't do that.
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
The worst was Blue.
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Oh, good.
Congratulations.
Hey!
You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin'pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here.
Hey, that's just fuckin'That's bullshit. You know, you know, what the fuck?
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
She's not here, Sam.
... listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't...
So, l l l listen, I te I te I tell you can I call you back in a few minutes?
Mm hm. 1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b
I'll call you right back.
You got it. Schmuck. All right. I just bought us a few minutes. Want to get back at this prick?
That's right.
No, tha that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Wh wh
Mommy.
Oh, no, please, please.
Ohhh...
He bet like a fuckin'brain surgeon.
How did Nicky collect?
If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight.
I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.
Yeah.
No, of course not.
Sure, you have my permission. But I I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
What?
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
All right, Ace?
Thanks, pal.
I'm I'm hearin'things from security. They're all ex cops. The Sheriff's lookin'to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin'you.
I'm just tellin'you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
In other words, I'm fucked.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
... very difficult to get in.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you? All of a sudden, you're tryin'to tell me what to do all the time.
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin'balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin'to put somethin'really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin'about, huh? You know! If you're actin'like this now, how can I depend on you? There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin'way.
Yeah, forget about your fuckin'license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin'license. You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
You should say so.
Just say so.
All right, fine.
Fine.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
You lost your control.
Yes, you lost your control.
All right.
All right.
Yeah.
My wife?
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
Listen, I would
I I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
Please...
... don't do it to me...
Okay?
Ju just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
That's right, yeah.
Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody.
The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin'heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care.
And at the...
What what, Caesar's?
... hundred yards further down the road.
Don't ask questions. Just be there.
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
No? You said I'm bringin'heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin'shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin'army, pal!
You want me to get out of my own fuckin'town?!
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin'casino because I made that possible!
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin'country clubs or your fuckin'TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin'on TV anyhow?!
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin'day?! They think you went batshit!
Your fuckin'ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin'on television! You wanted to go on TV.
You're makin'a big fuckin'spectacle of yourself.
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin'license on me, is that it?
Back
Back Back up, back up a fuckin'minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me! That's the only reason! Without me, you, personally, every fuckin'wiseguy skell  Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy a drunken bum  around'll take a piece of your fuckin'Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?! You're fuckin'warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin'head again! You motherfucker, you!
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin'to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you? You're gonna bury us both.
I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you.
I just told you. She called me.
She was afraid to call you.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know? But get the kid back here. She wants to come back. That's the, uh, that's the main thing here. You want your kid, don't you? Huh?
Yeah, uh, who's this?
Nick?
How'd you know I was here?
... Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
She's there with you? She's there with you?
I'll be right there.
She didn't know who to turn to. She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin'to save your marriage.
Hey, be fuckin'nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Are, uh are we certain that you want the Gamin'Control Board eyeballin'your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar. But, he is my brother in law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin'him back.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
No problem. Sorry.
You see? Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Okay. You come by the house?
Seven o'clock?
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit...
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
Why not make them happy?
Here we go. Good luck.
The little guy. He's half in the bag, and nobody told him he was eighty sixed from the joint, so we...
He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted.
Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to you later. Just You You got a gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over here right away.
I I'll do it.
I'll be right back.
Hello.
That was all bullshit. She just pocketed the cash.
... pit bosses, floor managers.
But mostly...
What, are you trying to handicap me?
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam?'Cause I don't.
I care about you, a But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
Understand? I'm sorry.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
Why're you crying?
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
You're with me now.
Right?
You sure?
Oh, it's so soft.
Oh...
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Okay.
So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
Oh, fabulous.
You get her? Okay. Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty five thousand.
Why do you need that much?
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for.
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it? That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
What are you talkin'a?
You're askin'me for twenty five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you? Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for.
Didn't. No, instead, what did he say?'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got. '
I didn't take your pills.
You didn't have to beat him up!
You can't make me stop caring...
I said, you can't make me stop caring about people.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin'way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
Yes, I yes, I do.
How could you say that? You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin'leech livin'off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody. You can do it. You can do it.
... routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.
Listen...
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
Right.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
... I I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
... under?
How serious?
It's under...
Yeah.
... the rest of the two million is still there?
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty five. That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
All right...
With the money.
Twenty five thousand for clothes.
Twenty five thousand for clothes and a watch.
Mm hm.
I bought him a watch too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just tryin'to figure it out.
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
Fine. I'm takin'Amy.
I am. I'm wakin'her up right now.
You threw it away?
I put her to bed.
With Jennifer.
To the Riviera.
I had a... salad.
She had the same.
Why do you want to do that?
Fine. Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
I was with somebody.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
Oh...
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby sitter wasn't there.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
Oh, sh
Fuck you.
I w I was gonna be back before she woke up.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
I want you to let me go.
Get get up!
Get up! Get going! Get up!
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin'hooker, always a hooker.
Just wait there for me!
I am not!
Don't you threaten me!
Don't you threaten me!
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
If she calms down...
They had all the pieces they needed.
Okay, I'll
Well...
Yeah, okay.
All right, I will, I will.
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I am so sorry.
Three fuckin'jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin'on?
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
Hey... Ward, you're pissin'me off. Now, you're insulting my intelligence. What do you think, I'm a fuckin'idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin'reels.
You Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
Listen, you fuckin'yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin'your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
I'm firin'you? No, I'm not firin'I'm firin'you, you
This is not the way to treat people.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a fair hearing.
No.
No, Sir.
Well, I... I never tried.
Ye yeah.
Is this yours? Your pen?
I ju Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
Yeah.
Thank you.
... I got muscled on the street.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave'em the money. That's what I did.
Yeah.
Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a fuck out of me! You want to embarrass me and make a fool out of me?! You didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled the fuckin'money, I'll give you the fuckin'money to put the fuckin'heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?!
Yeah, thanks.
We're not gonna go see any fuckin'elephants, okay?
No, you You want me to come over there? I'll smack your face.
What else? I gave her a schaff  Italian American slang for'tap'. 
What expenses?
You gotta go back out there.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
You're goin'out to Las Vegas, you're havin'a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
I'll to the FBI!
I'm just trying to get in my house!
He won't let me go in my house!
Can I go in?
And here. Here.
It looked like a fuckin'gun!
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
Is that what you did?
Tell him to go fuck himself? You fuckin'hick! Fuckin'...
Yeah, we're lookin'for Carmine.
He's not here?
Uh huh.
Oh, thanks, Eddy.
Fine, fine.
E mo va!  Italian American slang for'Now, go!'
Yeah. Everybody's talkin'about it. They're makin'a big deal out of it.
It's in all the papers.
And I mean... that's no good.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
Of course, Remo.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of'em could've would up gettin'killed.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin'to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin'killed too.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
I want to know... if he's doin'all right. If he's okay.
I'm askin'you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
Okay. Frankie, you're a good boy.
T'aggia parla.  Italian American slang for'I've got to talk to you' Nicky... See that guy?
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin'a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin'a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Not like your fuckin'friends out there, that... without brains. Okay?
Uh huh. Mi raccomando.  Italian American slang for'I'm counting on you'
Fine.
And how are things going down there?
Hi, how are you?
Yeah, no shit.
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...
Sure.
I can see that. Sure.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
No. I I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin'how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
I know what you mean.
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
He gives a fuck what I do?
Okay.
Yeah. Thanks.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
What? What?
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
Yeah.
Let me think about that.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
You know?
Hm.
Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too.
I didn't. I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
Exactly.
Yes, you did.
Yeah. Boy, he really fucked himself up out here didn't he?
Everything went to his head.
Exactly. He hates me.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
I need some help. I do. I need some help. You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Nicky, please...
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Uh huh
I told you this was fuckin'dangerous. Remember I said,'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.'You fuckin'yessed me to death.
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin'about? I'm not killing anyb
Hey, don't be such a fuckin'smartass, will you? I mean, I know the fuckin'guy thirty five years, I'm gonna fuckin'whack him for you? Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
How the fuck am I gonna get your fuckin'money now? You think he's gonna give you fuckin'money? Are you out of your mind?! Look what you just did to this fuckin'guy! If you would have just kept your fuckin'mouth shut! Ah, what the fuck is the use? I should've never got invol
All right, all right.
You fucked with me for the last time!
Well, you might as well get somethin'out of it.
Well, you know...
Yeah.
I'm here.
I'm always here for you.
I am.
Do you know that?
That's right.
God... I wish you...
Yeah, I do. I mean, it's it's the it's the best thing you can do right now. I mean this. And you'll have real security. Sweetheart... you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
You got money. That's a That's a good look.
Right.
He was just on the phone.
I just talked to him.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I
He's sittin'by the phone
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin'talk it over now?
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
Come on, damn it. Don't get so defensive. It could be stuck in your hair, you know.
Incredible.
Of course.
Come here, come here.
You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in.
This peter's a motherfucker.
Every night, on the couch.
Yeah?
Hey, Shelly.
This is Nick.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
They want a fuckin'war, I'm ready.
They're havin'a good time too.
What? Get out of here? I got a marker comin'.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
I know. I know.
Yeah, but they keep askin'about it.
What?
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let'em show you where it's at.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words,'Go see the Jew. '
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Did I say to do anything yet? I said I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I want to think about it. Where're these pricks at?
Yeah, either that or in the fuckin'bank. I don't know. They're all over the joint.
Take it easy!
You're gonna fuckin'kill her. Take it easy.
I'm in a bad fuckin'spot here. You know that? Bad fuckin'spot.
Take him out! Take this motherfucker out!
This motherfucker, do you believe this? Two fuckin'days and nights! Fuck me?
Charlie M?
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin'eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
Kill you, You motherfucker you! Frankie, do him a fuckin'favor.
How you doin'?
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin'it.
I'm positive.
You're a little confused?
Maybe if I stick your fuckin'face through this window over here like, you know, you'll you'll get unconfused. Give me the fuckin'money!
... this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh?
Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland... Can I get my winnings?
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
You say that like an amnesia victim.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't " Jeff. "
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight... Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen but nevertheless, would you?
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight. Wouldn't miss it.
I'm not afraid. Are you?
Oh, it's superb I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
I checked out your stuff at the library. Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a... with a.. what exactly am I, again?
So, did you see " Seinfeld " last week? That Kramer guy really makes me laugh.
No it's not.
Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.
Are you sure?
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
You're serious? You'd help me...
Can I just say what a classy touch the neon urinals are, Mr. Architect? I just love risking electrocution every time I..
Selina Kyle... lovely person.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
I suppose she does.
Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God?
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
What little boy doesn't?
Priceless... We have a showdown in this alley, right?
Just hold on! I'm not done. There are two kinds of men in the world, Selina. In Category A, you have Me. In Category B is everyone who wants to be in Category A, but are too afraid, too weak..!
Catwomen. Lots of them!
What do you want from me?
My dog!
Pass!
I know, I know, a Warrior. You're very annoying.. Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set..
Well then, let's agree to disagree... Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
The " skylight? " Fool! It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter...
Whatever you say... Sis.
And I... I.. want you to know our secrets..
" Save the City? " I don't want to save the city, I want to move! Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina.
Yeah, as in born before.. Ooh, I suppose it's " sexual harassment " to give a woman a compliment. Sheesh. Come on, gentleman...
Oh, what? I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's " sexual harassment... "
What if I were to say " You're Fired? "
Kelly, get to work on those new uniforms. I'm not running a summer camp here..
Yeah, she's okay.
How much?
Oh now this one is mine...
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
Ah! Ah! God no, don't tell me you're one of those women who are attracted to ruggedly handsome and brilliant architects..
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
You turned around!
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Nothing. How's your hand?
Like you don't know...
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
Hey, I thought...
You're scaring me, Selina. Do it some more.
You are...
Then there's you, Louis, sneaking through back alleys and surprise visiting me at my home.. Both of you have been way too frisky from the get go. I'm actually a pretty amazing person funny, smart, attractive when I get my sleep but you two had no way of knowing that when I met you both I was basically a morose, depressed amnesiac incapable of any human feeling. The only reason one of you wanted to go out with me is because you knew I was Catwoman.
I'll let you know.
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
Maybe.
Pretty good... Mom, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate... letting me stay, getting me the job I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just... we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take..
Because she asked me and I couldn't very well turn her down. Don't you remember of course you don't remember that " Hag " is the one who brought you to that hospital in Gotham City. For what it's worth currently not much we owe her your life... When I think about a single woman in Gotham City amnesia is probably the best thing that could happen to a girl like you... Oh, don't forget your visor.
I never thanked you.. the arrow.. the motorcycle.. the computer disc.. You're so different from what I.. and so the same.
Mom, not now! I, I don't know what to do..
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine.. I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
I don't know if I can do it alone.
Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit.. you know how us girls can be..
The kicks.. the rush.. you mean, like pulling heists.. faking your own deaths.. killing innocent bystanders... like Mexican angels. I know you're a woman. Do you?
Matter of fact I did have a kid once. But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him! Everything worked twice as good without him. We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
I know he's there! He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
Wake up. Make a right at Ocean Avenue. The hotel's a few blocks up on the left.
I am not! Fuck you! Theo's a genius.
So what? What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
You couldn't hurt me. But it's the principle.
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
How was I in the wrong?
She can't! It's busted. Now hand that on back!
Did you have to tell her my name?
You gotta just look the other way.
They'll wait. Meantime, raise the lid.
You almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you're on my side? You stupid fuck!
Only I was sloppy. I let you take me out. That was quite a humiliation.
Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation?
What else did you expect him to say? Do it, Theo or give me the gun.
You can tell she was really worried about me.
You never miss a trick.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation. So let's go over this again step by step.
That's your " rep. "
If you know that just back off.
And stop with the directions.
That's illegal. You want us pulled over? I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count. I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a Hockney.
Let's hope so. Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Any minute.
We've had our share of fuck ups but it's going to work out fine.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying
No. You don't understand! You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates. And I've got no time to screw around.
And what're you whispering for?
What'd you do! Just pick my number out of the air?
Who smashed the phone?
Sure. And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life. This has gotta be some " put on, " right?
You're not doing anything to me because listen to this carefully I do not care.
You're the one who's not to be believed.
I don't want to know
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
I am not involved. Keep clicking your little wires. You'll get someone else. Good luck.
Oh won't I?
Don't lay this on me!
Where'd they take you to?
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
The cops could trace this call back to you.
What makes you say that?
Who?
Oh man. These people mean business.
Listen, there's an overpass coming up. I may lose you for a minute.
Please.
I can't stay on this line. I'm picking people up. I'm already overdue. Hello?
Don't move around. You don't want to puncture a lung.
Stop throwing names at me.
What do they need her for?
Bottom line! There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
They don't know you. They won't listen.
26th off Wilshire.
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
I kind of dropped them off. They were getting on my nerves.
What do you think I'm doing? I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
Tell me what she looks like.
I'm not looking to get myself killed. I just hope the battery on this phone holds out.
I don't know. 80 or 90 minutes, tops.
I don't know. I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
Hey drop it, okay?
It never healed. I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her. " Click. " You don't exist.
I sure as hell got my wish. She doesn't exist. So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
Well you did.
Our house always needs touching up.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you. Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
I didn't mean to. It's just the way I am.
I wasn't always like that. I don't think I was.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you. Theo?
Great. Stay with me. There must be a hundred kids out here.
I've got to ask somebody.
Don't say anything. Don't alarm them. Just go!
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
What bank?
Black Mercedes, 600S.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood. That bank is our best bet. If anybody shows up I could follow them.
Not a chance.
Do you know what's in that box?
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
You're doing what you can. Why's all this money stashed?
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
What's going on?
I might still get there first. The lights are with me. How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
It won't be him.
Yeah, sure that's me. Ask anybody.
I've got a lot of respect for you too. For the way you feel about your family.
Why tell me this?
You can't give up.
Did you hear that click?
Or somebody else there is listening in
Don't panic. I might be wrong. Hello? I guess I was wrong.
They dragged me downstairs. I thought they were going to kill me.
What did you do?
God, if he doesn't come back
They're tied with duct tape so they can't speak but they seem to be
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
He's in back. Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore but he was crying. I never heard Jack cry before
Yes.
Yes sir.
She's next. In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
Don't start thinking about it. Is the tape off?
Can you walk?
They won't allow that. It's one at a time. And you have to be first.
She's a child. She might panic. She doesn't know me. She might not come to me. She might just run.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
She'll never be the same. None of us will.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed. Probably all the wrong ones.
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out. So don't get any ideas.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
Somehow I got along better with you on the phone. It's all there isn't it?
The rest of the money is here in the car. Why don't you come and get it?
Whose money is this?
The guy with the transplant.
Damned if I know.
At least one.
You timed that beautifully.
I got what I fucking deserved. I had it all. I could've kept going!
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop
There was no cop involved. Oh shit! Fuck!
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Shit. You couldn't be in much worse shape.
Assure them that you're being well treated.
Not all. They already have a third. The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off. Ever see that Tarantino movie where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat purely by accident?
Absolutely. And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
I'm not trying to lose them. Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative. Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good. That's on their head. All I did I was put him there.
What's that supposed to me?
You, I would've noticed.
You were at the Emerald that night?
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
You're enjoying this too much.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Yes I would. Not kill you. But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution. It'll help you to remember me in years to come every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now with little nails on them you can polish
Then scream for me. A repeat performance. Let me see how easy you can turn it on. Scream! I want to hear you scream for me!
He wants 75 back.
Did you hear that?
What's Nels'number?
Dial him up. We need him to run interference.
Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine.
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
They did some great job of reforming you.
Think you could do a picture of me?
I need a break. I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.
You've had a lot of fun with me today. What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
How about " later? "
That's a reasonable possibility.
What's your point?
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
Naturally.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
That's how it's going to be.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
The phones, Theo. Don't leave any of them behind. The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and find you.
My fence in San Francisco... 305 4410. Maurice. Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
I told you... sooner or later you'd have to trust me...
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about. I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
I think I've already had a " quickie. " Thank you.
Sure, I end up with some cash. And a lot of bonds I don't know how to dispose of.
It's in your interest, Nels, since the additional passenger in my trunk an LAPD officer is probably carrying a few bullets in him traceable to the piece you're carrying. Tell the man.
Tailgate me. I'll jam on the brakes. You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman. There's a hairpin coming up that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends. Tighten your belts. Here it comes. Ready?
You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
Who's this?
What does it take to kill you?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
That bitch. What's keeping you from taking off?
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds. I may need to pry that information out of her. What do you stand to gain?
Where do I turn?
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco we'll ride up together.
We're gonna get there first.
Believe me. They couldn't be busier at the moment.
Where's the backpack?
At those prices I'd just as soon your cabbie didn't get a look at me.
Don't underestimate me. I've got original ideas of my own. Warhol got famous doing a soup can. What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Brilliant unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away. In which case you just warned them.
Let me talk to the lady again.
If you've already killed her that's fine. I'll keep the bonds and the cash. We got nothing to discuss.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
Doesn't everybody?
Very official. 259 7881, if I recall.
I thought so.
Well, you get to say, The usual, Col. Things like that.
He's what she should run a mile from.
Who knows the secrets of the human heart.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
Whatever you say.
He gave me a look.
What you think?
Now, that was a look.
I've no thoughts on the subject.
Good thing in a man.
Maybe he wants something.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
Fuck it, is what I say.
Fucking men, Col
You fucking did.
Jimmy.
Maybe.
Fuck off back to Essex!
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
No, of course not, she's a lady.
Whatever it is she does for you.
Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.
Off his wages.
Who?
What's his name?
Nothing.
Not English.
How'd you guess?
And what's it like?
Don't know. Who is she?
Not you. How quaint. How old fashioned and quaint. Isn't it, Col?
What was that all about?
Perform?
You on the game?
But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud, but never cheap.
Half five. At Millie's.
The one you gave me in the Metro.
Why?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
You want one?
I'm not on my own, am I?
What'll it be?
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
As different as it's possible to be.
No.
Yes.
Are you jealous of him?
That's good...
I think you do.
Do I?
A real gentleman...
Maybe.
Did he dance with you?
What does that mean?
I'm superstitious. Drink.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
No, depends on nothing.
Why?
Told you, I'm superstitious.
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
Tell him it hurt
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Sorry, darling.
Apologies, my sweet.
And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared.
Sure I do.
Yeah. I care, Dil.
Made me feel all funny inside.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
Nothing's wise.
So I'm sorry.
How?
Will you meet me again?
Whenever. Tonight.
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
All right, they do.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Kind of wish I didn't.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
I'm working on it.
Sorry.
No. Can't pretend that much.
Should have stayed a girl.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
So I got it wrong, then.
Don't.
Come on.
No.
She's the thing you had to tell me.
I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really sorry.
She from Scotland too?
And you're not going to tell me more?
Do you like me even a little bit?
You'd do anything for me?
You got the keys to the shop?
Want to change you to a man, Dil...
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
And you wouldn't leave me?
You promise?
You like me better like this.
For you...
Told you to stay in the hotel!
No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.
Yes.
What condition?
What?
Your soldier.
Are you listening?
Died...
It was you...
You didn't.
You tried.
Just don't kick Dil and she'll be touched. Be nice to her and she'll be yours forever.
Try and go, then.
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
Love me.
Tell me you love me.
Then say it.
You do?
What would you do for me?
I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it.
What happened to Jimmy?
Yes.
Can't remember...
Yes. Now.
Not if you go.
You will, Dil
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
Meet Col
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty four left.
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
What's that supposed to mean?
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
All right, then. I like to be wise.
Do you now.
Aha.
Did you give him it?
Have a look at him.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
Eddie and Tinker died.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
So you did fuck up.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
You're never out, Fergus.
Of course. I forgot.
Perfect.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
Who's the old geezer?
I sincerely hope so.
Why would you do that?
So?
You sure?
It's your decision.
You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep.
Are you all there?
Yes.
Why?
Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days.
What?
You sure about that?
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
I thought it was Dave.
He's at home.
I know that.
Fuck you, too
And who is she?
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Good.
It's a knocking shop. Tres discreet, huh? He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. His security's in the car beyond.
Hope not.
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
So it's on the street.
Kind of suicide, isn't it?
What do you mean you can't?
I seen your fucking face.
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
Yeah. And the brown eyes.
Only joking.
No?
You trying to hurt my feelings?
Well, I could say the same about you.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
Kill me.
They won't let him die.
I'm not a gambling man.
Why can't we?
What do you know about my nature?
What the fuck do you know about my people?
Shut the fuck up, would you?
No, what's the funny thing?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
My inside pocket.
Why not?
No?
She your wife?
So what were you fucking around for, then?
She's a friend of mine
What?
I got sent.
Can't. Once I signed up.
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
" Go back to your banana tree, nigger. " No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
Best game in the world.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Never.
Toffs'game there. But not at home..
These things take time, Fergus.
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.
Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.
Why?
Jody's always right.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Like having a pint in the Metro
Who's Dil?
Oh, yeah.
The best.
Do you?
We don't look on it like that.
Depends on what you believe in.
That you guys shouldn't be here.
Yes.
I didn't.
You liked her?
Don't know her.
What?
Don't think that way.
Take her picture. C'mere.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking
I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette.
What?
Like the one about the frog?
When I was a child...
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
Faster than cricket?
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back
I said you bastard stop
What?
And you know what?
You never know.
It was fun while it lasted.
Give me the fucking shooter!
I'll tell you what, fella you want t'find me, you jus'turn'round from now on I'll be right behind you.
You know what I mean the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
What are you talking about?
It's simple. I like what I do I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
Yes, but
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on
All that marvelous rejection you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
Oh!
No I guess not.
What?
It's lovely.
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
There's no time I'll call you in the morning.
I just heard from him he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
Where's that airlines bag?
I sure am. Get it.
Lord, you're stubborn.
The letter
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
Yes, you told me.
Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had on the day he was killed.
I think it only said where but I can't
That money's not ours, Adam if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Of course there is!
Well it was a place a street corner, I think. But I don't Hold it. I'm on.
But Charles'appointment was last week, not
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
I'm not Dyle you know that!
Don't be an idiot!
Reggie trust me once more please.
There's not a reason on earth why you should.
The truth, now was it my hide or the stamps?
All right, prove it to me tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps.
Then say it.
Never mind I'll go by myself.
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here to ask me that? She has it you know that.
Supposing I did have it which I don't do you really think I'd hand it over?
I don't know, Herman maybe you do.
Or you Or you
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
Why you lied to me.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Your
How can I? You lied to me the way Charles did and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name which I don't even know yet. What is it? Aren't you going to tell me? Hello?
Scobie?
Come on I've got something that stings like crazy.
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Sure.
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
There you're a new man.
You can't.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Whitefoot, of course.
Oh oh here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
I'm not fifteen.
Why can't you be serious?
Said what?
Okay I'll tell you what we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous how about that?
What are you doing?
Who told you to do that?
But I'm not through complaining yet.
I'll be right there.
Lord, I forgot all about it Sylvie works late Tuesday nights she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean Louis with you and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Or Tex?
You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
Because I really suspect Gideon and it is always the person you don't suspect.
What's so illogical about that?
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie. Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
No Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in'American in Paris'without a care in the world? This is good, want some?
Hm?
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
Yes, I know.
What? Assassinate somebody?
The shower's in there.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
I don't think I know that one.
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around I want you to believe that.
No not yet.
Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?
I don't understand you at all one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life not that it would ever make the best seller list.
Why don't you shut up!
Are you going to listen?
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need including some they'd barely miss.
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Well, I can't really blame you not now.
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
Yes.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one a Swedish four shilling called'De Gula Fyraskillingen'issued in 1854.
The money is unimportant.
In your money, perhaps  65, 000.
It is called'The Hawaiian Blue'and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
Forty five thousand.
A two penny Mauritius issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others  30, 000 perhaps.
The best for the last le chef d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called'The Gazette Guyanne.'It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer. Today it has a value of  100, 000. Eh, bien I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative which comes to nine francs fifty.
Why bother him?
You think that mebbe we're fishin'the wrong stream?
You don't s'pose one o'us has it, like the man said I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful us bein'vet'rans o'the same war'n'all.
Nachurly. Jus'like I'd tell you.
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert you do know that, don't you?
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Dead, Mrs. Lampert like last week's news like Charles, Mrs. Lampert
She isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions.
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild. We don't know each other, do we?
I don't know how would I know?
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list
How's that?
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Peter Joshua.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Good for you.
Please, not on my account.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
I'm not sure I
Oh. I guess.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Is your husband with you?
Mr. Joshua. Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
No, I'm not I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Shakespeare never said that.
It's terrible you just made it up.
Are you in the book?
Is there only one Charles Lampert?
How did you find out?
Thank you.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Doing what?
Instant divorce you mean?
Come on. You can't stay here.
We'll find you a hotel.
Something modest but clean and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains okay?
I'm sorry I heard the children laughing.
I'm still having trouble with English.
You mean you and me?
I don't think I follow you.
Who said?
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
I wasn't
What was it?
What your husband was mixed up in.
Don't you know I could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor?
On the street where you live.
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
Nothing. Good night.
Out of the window, I guess I didn't see him.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
What?
No, it isn't where's the money?
So they think he left it with you.
Of course I'll help I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
Do you tell lies?
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
I don't but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Go to sleep I'll see you in the morning.
Hey I'm on your side. Remember that.
Good night.
Charlie had no call to handling it this a way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Come on now sure you do. An'you'd better give it to me, Miz Lampert cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!
You think on it real careful like, Miz Lampert y'hear?
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have but
I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable.
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
Don't ask me I'm only the widow. If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
He's allergic to him.
Hold it Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
What's he up to?
I'm glad. But what's all this?
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie we've got to find him!
Those stamps they're worth a fortune!
A fortune! Hurry we've got to find him!
Yeah? What's that?
Why?
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
You do?
Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
Ok!
Good.
Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is.
She's my daughter, Tom.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
Is there anything you do?
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p. m.
Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
You're grounded Friday night!
You said that two weeks ago.
They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
I will. Is that all?
I have a question to ask you. A personal question.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
A little.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
Not much further.
No honey.
I'm not.
I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
Who is she Daddy?
What did you hear?
Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.
We need you here. I can bring her in.
Should we close down any eruption?
We're seeing all the signs in town.
Did you warn her?
She's underage.
She's not here.
St. Michael's.
She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago.
She was murdered?
Can you get inside?
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
No.
No, you couldn't.
Really?
Why?
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
Ok.
You gave me a'D'.
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
Sure.
Then you should go.
I really do. For your own safety.
Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting.
Yes.
You're the killed.
Mark Shale.
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
You stare at him non stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
No!
That was before he pulled this'Dick me or I dump you'shit. I say fuck his best friend.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
NO?!
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
Mark invited me to the party.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
Especially not your dad.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's'Fuck or Die'time.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience.
I heard you got attacked.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Why?
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
You know I want to go with you.
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
They're not picking me up until six.
Yes!
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
I don't know. I kind of am.
I'm making you feel like meat?
You flaunt some slut in my face.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
Mom?
I need to ask you something.
Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
What?
Did he say anything else about her?
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
Not that I know of.
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
Don't make me order you.
I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them'queers'.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
Two men left town right after it happened.
Yes.
NO!
Kenny's aunt?
His mother's an only child.
What?
I guess so. Luckily we won't have that problem.
What?
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
Now don't be nervous.
Hide your laptop here.
You can't bring it.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
That wasn't me...
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
Unfair?!
At least somebody likes this shit.
EXT. MOTEL NIGHT.
EXT. ROAD DAY.
... if we don't get out of this tunnel!
... yeah. Tryin'to get most of my day done before it hits nine...
Where's Sam?
Where do you want this stuff?
Great.
The guy's a fuckin'moron.
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Since when does...
Since today. New policy.
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
Well, he told me to collect cash.
... moron.
Uh, huh?
He could've called first.
... and fair...
Bein'that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
... for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin'over the mountain.
Huh?
Oh.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.
I need your truck.
No, no, no. You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon...
Wait, wait. You don't believe the dead guy, do...
Yeah, I believe him. He was my friend.
Hey, listen! Do you know what I think? I...
... o of all, wantin'to be a part of this wacko shit!
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
Then you drive me to McGrud...
Look... I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin'in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago. That shit will be worthless by noon.
... is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin'my ass as far away from you and it as possible.
All right.
Wait, wait, wait. Hold up. Hold up. Look.
You want cash?
I got, uh....
I'll rent the truck from you. You can stay here, you can go. Whatever you want.
All right, then how about this?
... doing?!
You are not takin'my truck!
Look, put this in the back. Keep it safe.
There we go. There we go. Did you keep it safe? Did you
You gave him ice cream, didn't you? Come on, let's go.
What did you do that for? It makes him mean as a snake.
That dog ain't mean.
Come on, get in the truck.
Shut...

Damn.
It happens to this piece of shit...
Damn diesel injections are flood...
... ed.
Do you wanna give me a minute?
... town.
... er.
No, no, no.
No way. We're goin'through McGrud...
I ain't goin'through Missoula!
Look... I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
Yeah, borrowed!
You stole this truck!
You stole this truck! That's...
... the ice cream for money!
Look, I don't give a shit if you go through Missoula at a hundred miles an hour. We're goin'to McGruder.
... fine.
Shut up.
We can't push old Pete in this heat. He can't take it.
... damn!
Ah, one of them's in the back.
Okay.

Shut up.
Take your gun!
What?
... work! It's not even load...
You mean to tell me you hijacked me with an empty gun?!


Okay! All right!
Nice job back there.
Don't gimme that " nice job " shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
I was thankin'you, asshole!

... er!
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
You wanna hit me?

I did not steal the truck.
It was owed to me. You stole the damn...
Shut up, shut up! It's beeping.

Hey! Hey! Andy's Ice Cream.
Oh!
Oh, shit.

Oh, shit.

You think we can make what?! You see that truck?!
Hey, and what if we don't make it?!
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us! Everybody dies!
... do we?
That's right. Now, move!

Okay.
Oh, Petey. Oh, Petey. Oh, please, Pete. Please don't do this to me. Okay.
Go, go, go, go, go. Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
Come on, old Pete.

What the fuck was that?!
Gee, you think so?
Okay. That didn't work.
Shut up!
Ho, ho...

Come on!

Oh, shit!
Oh, no!



Whoo hoo hoo!
This thing just went up a degree. Ice cream's not workin'.
Okay.

... did you?
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi...
Hey, I didn't steal the truck. You...
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck. Andy owes me a lot more than that four wheeled...
It won't even start half the time.
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
... there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it. But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
... just ready to just slide him right in there. And what about me, huh? What about Arlo, huh? What about my needs? You know, I got a I got student loans...
Nobody's lookin'out for my interests. My credit was fucked! And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped. So I split.

Yeah.
How wonderful for you.
Robert Del Rio?
I remember him. Got in a car crash or somethin'.
And I put the car into a ditch. He spent eighteen weeks in the...
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
And things sort of just went downhill from there.
Well, shit. Could be worse. I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.

... shit.
Not completely, anyway.
... loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot...
... Long. Somethin'about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
Well, all the same. If we get to Missoula, help me find a car. I'd appreciate it. Then... you can...
Split? I wouldn't get ten...

Whoo!
Yeah.

" Went away. " I like that.
All right. After they put you away...
And let me guess. You failed.
Why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction...
Brynner.
Good to see you again, Leo.
I can't say it's a surprise.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
And I don't like deviations from plans, Leo, as I'm sure you re...
... I lost all my squeamishness at Leav...
Hm. The wind's northwest. That oughta be... Seattle.
... maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
And I'm warning you, Leo. Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
Tell the choppers we're lifting off!

Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...

Gomez, you fight the battles you can win. Now, we've been outmaneuvered here. Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder. To do that, he has to have planned an exit point. That's where we intercept him. That's where we make our play. Now you and your men back off.
Here's what I want you to do.
All right. Enough. Look...
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle. I told you Mason was walking shit.
The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
And where are you going?
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
Have you I. D.'d the bodies?

Well, your prediction was on the nose.
I don't know. Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe... another hour?

What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
Where are you now...

INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK / BOX DAY.
Talk to me.

INT. TUNNEL DAY.
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
An honest living.
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Well, then, how about a ruler?
The print's pretty fine. I forgot my glasses. I'd like to be able to read across.
Yes, sir, that's what it looks like. I'll give you that.
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
They're calling it an accident.
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
Oh yes.
We worked in Chinatown together.
Very.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
None.
Too bad?
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
What for?
Was he right?
' Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis'girlfriend.
Yes, his girlfriend.
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
No.
What about her?
I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Just find the girl.
Avocado groves?
Is she all right?
Where is she?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
Haven't the faintest idea.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
How do you do that?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
Who do you blame for that? Her?
Ain't worth thinking about.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
What's that, Curly?
Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.
Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
How about a glass of wine? Honey, this is...
In the garage.
Off the alley.
Sure, as soon as we eat.
I'll just tell my wife.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
I'll throw that in too.
Curly, you know how long I been in business.
Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do? So he says what do they do? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while. Just listen a second, Duffy...
That's a filthy habit.
Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too.
Why?
I'm not.
Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it.
The apple core?
How do they do that?
But what?
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
Yeah, they are.
Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.
Well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and I guess you have.
Since I made Lieutenant.
Looking for someone.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
I'd like to talk to him.
Or her name?
No. It was an accident.
When I do, you'll hear about it.
How do you happen to know her?
Let me show you something.
Just to be on the safe side, we had Loach here give you a ring.
I want the rest of the pictures.
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
C'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?
Absolutely.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
They only dump the water at night.
Where?
What's the maid's address?
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
Well, let's go.
Give you three minutes.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Gittes, stay outta this.
An accident?
Obviously the fall must have knocked him out.
No.
Certainly not!
A complete surprise?
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
Mr. Gittes.
Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...
Iced tea.
That's not his apartment.
What?
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course. She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just
Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him. Did you talk this morning?
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6: 30.
Please call first.
You left your keys in the ignition.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
If your husband was killed it was. This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
My husband.
Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay. When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
Mr. Gittes.
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
I can't tell you.
I mean I can't tell you.
Yes... why?
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
I don't believe you.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
What for? There's nothing more to say. Get my car, please.
I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.
So you married your father's business partner?
Over the water department, or over you?
Then it was over the water department.
Oh, yeah?
Never forgave him for what?
You sure shout that?
What about you? Do you and your father get along?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L. A. into building it, only the water won't go to L. A. It'll go here.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today. That bother you?
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7, 000 acres, Emma Dill 12, 000 acres, Clarence Speer 5, 000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25, 000 acres.
Know him?
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
Two weeks ago he bought those 25, 000 acres. That's unusual.
They may not know it but they are.
What do you mean,'why?'Nobody's here, that's all.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
I guess not to you, Mrs. Mulwray. Frankly you really saved my a... my neck tonight.
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
When was the last time?
Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
Working for the District Attorney.
They do in Chinatown.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
... No. Why was it.
Could you do anything about it?
What about it?
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
... Yes, sort of a birthmark...
And I want to know where.
Where are you going?
The Albacore Club.
I know.
I saw him.
This morning.
There hasn't been a lot of time.
Do? To who?
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
It's possible.
It's possible. Please don't ask me any more questions now. Just wait, wait for me. I'll be back. I need you here.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
Then let's go talk to her.
Hollis'death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
Yes.
What does it look like?
You're insane.
I will if you don't.
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Upstairs. Why?
... she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
You're going to miss your train! Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
You know any good criminal lawyers?
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.
Katherine?... Katherine who?
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
I'll take care of it.
... where does Kyo live?
On his day off. Get the exact address.
Sure, but I'd like to handle it.
Sophie.
Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz. And how about that snotty broad? What does she think, she's perfect? Coming in waving her lawyers and her money at me  so goddam smug. She's no better than anybody else in this town.
There's just one question.
Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
He never even kids about it.
Well, tell him I'll be back.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
I don't understand.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation. I don't know what you're talking about.
I said, the northwest valley.
Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and I can't give you an exact location...
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over. Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.
Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
When it comes.
Comes in different parts of the river. Every night a different part.
That's a long fall.
The L. A. River?
Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon.
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800, 000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
Never heard of'em... new owners?
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Gittes.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Gee whiz. And I'm late.
Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go in and wait?
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
He did or he didn't?
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
How did they get it away from him?
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
They were partners.
What about?
Apple core?
Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit.
Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart, will you? Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in Pedro, near the Starkist cannery. It's the Evening Star. He'll be waiting. I'll take care of this.
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She must be about thirty three, thirty four.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross'daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.
That's for sure.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass all the way to China and back, let's make a deal. These strips here are yours, I give them to you. However! One you're not to stick your nose in here any more. Two I'll keep them for you, because you can't take them home for God forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all hell will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now scram!
What you find tonight on the floor between the seats?
All right, all right! When I've got kids that's what I'm telling them!
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross... You'd work Good Fridays too!
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good... Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing.
With time... you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too. So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want! Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!! But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible! I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt!
Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!! Good thing Germany's closer than Russia.
Don't do that... Sooner or later you'll be left empty handed.
Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last... Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things... That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before... And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it... And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget... So, Toto, how are these home movies going?
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
Is there a woman?... Tell me the truth... There is a woman.
They're not my words. John Wayne said it in Shepherd of the Hills.
Don't think about it, Toto. Don't even try. With feelings, there's nothing to understand.
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
No! You mean right at the end? ALFREDO That's right, Toto, right at the end? And don't ask me what it means. If you figure it out, let me know...
Could be... But I don't like this business. It smells fishy to me.
You were expecting her? Huh?... It's a nasty business waiting by yourself. In company it's better. No?... Then I'll leave.
No, nobody came.
Toto, sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing. So it's better to shut up. It's hot in here. Toto, take me to the beach.
It was probably meant to be like this. Each of us has a star to follow. So now what are you thinking of doing?
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed. When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two... And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?... You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born... But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am.
No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life's not like you saw it in the movies. Life... is harder. Get out! Go back to Rome. You're young, the world is yours! And I'm old... I don't want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about you.
And the next time don't go around saying such heresy. You survived the fire at the movie house. But no one can save you from the fire of Hell!
No particular reason... Nice day, huh?
Bye bye, Elena.... What an idiot! What an idiot!'Nice day'! Christ!!
But... who...
For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus.
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
No. And I'm not married. Are you happy?
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
I told him I'd take his advice. But before I went away I left you that note... I was on my way down the stairs...
Then where's the money?
You shouldn't tell me that now. After all these years! I put all your things in here. Go in, go in...
You never used to do that!
That's all there is.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein. I'm dictating it.
Get me a typewriter. I'll finish the notice.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half pound of tea you'll just hold him until I get back, won't you?
I'll write it myself.
Look at that.
You know how long it took the " Chronicle " to get that staff together? Twenty years.
Huh? Oh, I forgot you've been away so long I forgot about your joking
I do. I do. I mean, since you're running for Governor and you want to be elected I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected. Only Can I say something?
Well, the way I look at it You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end. Anything you want to know about him about the paper
That Rosebud? Maybe some girl? There were a lot of them back in the early days, and
You're pretty young, Mr. Mr. Thompson. A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me. One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on and she was carrying a white pastrol and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl. See what I mean? Well, so what are you doing about this " Rosebud, " Mr. Thompson.
Who else you been to see?
Susie? I called her myself the day after he died. I thought maybe somebody ought to... She couldn't even come to the'phone.
Sure, sure.
Who else did you see?
Thatcher! That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met
It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money. Thatcher!
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that. He put all his ambition on that girl. After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to. Oh, I don't blame Susie
Oh, yes. He saw to that. I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out. He had that funny sense of humor. And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. You see, Leland didn't think so. I guess he showed him all right. He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer. They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer.
It ended Then there was Susie that ended, too. I guess he didn't make her very happy You know, I was thinking that Rosebud you're trying to find out about
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost almost everything he had You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot. I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself. He may be out of town somewhere he may be dead.
You don't say! Why I had no idea
Just old age. It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of. You ought to see Mr. Leland. There's a whole lot of things he could tell you if he wanted to.
You just made the paper over four times today, Mr. Kane. That's all
Sure. They're like anybody else. They got work to do. They do it. Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
Probably. There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane without his knowing it.
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse faced hypocrite? Am I a New England school marm?
Not to me. But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Kane? Charlie? Where is he?
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
I thought it would be a nice gesture the new publisher
You may resume your work, gentlemen. I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
You've got a private office here, haven't you?
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day except for the business offices
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough. The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone
The " Chronicle " doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter. It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter. Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone. Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the " Enquirer " will have him arrested. Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
But Mr. Kane, I meant
I'm sure that's it.
Not at all. I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, but I wonder if
Emily!
Emily, you're being a little unfair You know what I think of Charles'behavior about your personal lives
I know that, Emily
Emily, you
It's all over
If you're asking me to sympathize with him, Brad, you're wasting your time. There's only one person I'm sorry for, as a matter of fact. That that shabby little girl. I'm really sorry for her, Brad.
They won't hurt you, darling. Mother's with you! Mother's looking after you!
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
No, it can't. Good night, darling.
I'm going to 185 West 74th Street.
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me
I suppose so, but I'm not afraid of the story. You can't tell me that the voters of this state
No.
Go on! Get out! I can fight this thing all alone!
What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go?
Toothache.
If you want to come in and wash your face I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers
No. They've passed on.
I know... But you do look so silly.
Thanks.
I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do.
A rooster?
Excuse me, Mr. Kane. I know this takes a lot of nerve, but who are you? I mean I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that
No. That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is
You've been wonderful! I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
How old did you say you were?
I didn't think you did. If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
That's a ripe old age What do you do?
Is that what you want to do?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Would you sing for me?
Yes, I would. That's why I asked.
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
I mean in New York.
At night?
Hurray for the bulldog! Half past eleven! The shows have just let out. People are going to night clubs and restaurants. Of course, we're different. We live in a palace at the end of the world.
Can't we go back, Charlie?
It's not a habit. I do it because I like it.
Invite everybody! Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents! Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own with their own bath, where they know where everything is?
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business. You've got no right
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself or I ought to be. I was once. Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to. You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me that don't mean anything to you. What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at? It's only money. It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
Well, I'm not going to stop it. I'm going to say exactly what I think. You've never given me anything. You've tried to buy me into giving you something. You're it's like you were bribing me! That's what it's been from the first moment I met you. No matter how much it cost you your time, your money that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known. Tried to bribe them!
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I'm going to leave you.
Yes.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie. We've said everything that can be said.
I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one. I don't even know what a gentleman is. You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs. Kane well, if I owned a newspaper and if I didn't like the way somebody else was doing things some politican, say I'd fight them with everything I had. Only I wouldn't show him in a convict suit, with stripes so his children could see the picture in the paper. Or his mother. It's pretty clear I'm not a gentleman.
I see!
But, it is impossible. I will be the laughingstock of the musical world! People will say
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you
Where'm I going?
" Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast. " You know you haven't the slightest proof that this this armada is off the Jersey Coast.
The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you don't realize you're talking to two people.
On the other hand I am the publisher of the Enquirer. As such, it is my duty I'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure to see to it that decent, hard working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to look after their interests! I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher. I think I'm the man to do it. You see, I have money and property
Lock it and keep it locked.
Mrs. Kane liked poetry
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
A wasted day.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad. We'll cover it the way the " Hickville Gazette " covers the church social! The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes I tell you, Brad, I envy you. By Bradford Leland, the " Enquirer's " Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted
All right, Brad, all right you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to I'd want to. Hello, Georgie.
They do it only because you do!
I mean I've got a job for you.
You don't want to be a war correspondent how about being a dramatic critic?
Yes?
You're wrong. It does make a difference to you Rector's, Brad? Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent. You won't miss anything. It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.
Yes?
Why not?
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the " Enquirer " in his pocket?
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death
They're true! Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high pressure crooks Nobody can blame me because
Charlie! Now you're not making sense.
What?
I'd like to talk to you about that.
I'm drunk.
I want to be transferred to the new paper. You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to That's not what I wanted to talk about.
I don't think so, Brad. We've just had word that the President is out of danger. It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Sure I am. She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes. I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
You might have made the whole thing less personal!
You almost convince me. I'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth. I have to be a little drunk for that because I'm a coward. You know that. That's why you keep me around. You only associate with your inferiors, Charlie. I guess that's why you ran away from Emily. Because you can't stand the company of your equals. You don't like to admit they exist the other big people in your world are dead. I told you that.
Yes. Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
That's all right. What are you going to do about Emily?
Hey, Brad! I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight let's have another brandy.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York. It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth.
What check?
Oh, yes, the bonus.
I think it's beginning to dawn on Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say. With Mr. Rogers out of the way, Reilly, I think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state. Well, Mr. Bernstein?
Yes.
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
Maybe you could remember something that
David, Grobleski  Davis My dear Rawlston
Oh, yes. I know about Mr. Rawlston.
I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday. I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane. She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget. With assurances of the highest esteem
He married for love That's why he did everything. That's why he went into politics. It seems we weren't enough. He wanted all the voters to love him, too. All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story it's the story of how he lost it. You see, he just didn't have any to give. He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly and his mother, I guess he always loved her. As for Emily well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair there's supposed to be two sides to every story and I guess there are. I guess there's more than two sides
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think. Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have. I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years. He hadn't finished it when she left him he never finished it he never finished anything. Of course, he built it for her
I don't know. He was disappointed in the world. So he built one of his own An absolute monarchy It was something bigger than an opera house anyway Nurse! Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
Hey, Nurse!
How do you do, Charles?
I know, but
Hold this thing up for a week. Two weeks if you have to...
Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick. Go after the people that knew Kane well. That manager of his the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course
Yeah. I guess he wasn't very happy those last years he didn't have much reason to be
Yes and no.
See what I mean? He was a little gone in the head the last couple of years, anyway but I knew how to handle him. That " Rosebud " that don't mean anything. I heard him say it. He just said " Rosebud " and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor. He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead He said all kind of things I couldn't make out. But I knew how to take care of him.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Think again!
Get out of here! Get out! Get out!
You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane.
What do you mean?
He was in love with me. But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
He wanted me to be comfortable Oh, why should I bother? You don't believe me, but it's true. It just happens to be true. He was really interested in my voice. What are you smiling for? What do you think he built that opera house for? I didn't want it. I didn't want to sing. It was his idea everything was his idea except my leaving him.
They haven't been tough on me. I just lost my money. But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him
Don't you think I do? You say you're going down to Xanadu?
I know. If you're smart, you'll talk to Raymond. That's the butler. You can learn a lot from him. He knows where the bodies are buried.
Are you sure?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
How long have you been smoking?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
You think I'm shitting you...
Unnhh!
It's not the same.
I'll just take the gum.
Sure. Go ahead.
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
I think you'd better leave now.
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
Yeah, but not in here.
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
She said not to come home until graduation.
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
You can hold me down.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Dick.
So where is he?
God, isn't he great?
Can I use the bathroom?
Why aren't there any lights?
You're kidding.
Such a sordid state of affair.
I'll try to manage.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
He was?
You dog! I didn't see you go back there.
My God. I haven't seen you since...
Train. It took eight hours.
You saw it?
It's not what you think.
I'm not pregnant.
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
Well... kind of, sort of?
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
No.
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
Was I right?
I love a macho fa  ade. It's such a turn on. What smells like shoe polish?
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
I'm giving him his ring back.
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff. I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
I just told you.
Why, Mr. Hicks whatever do you mean?
You don't have anything to do with it.
Look how full of yourself you are.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
I'm sure Sang and Veronica? would like that.
You're serious. You want to date again.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
You work in a market, all right.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
You mean, on a date?
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
Sang.
He's not invited.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again. And yes let me placate your ego you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
You're such an asshole.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
Where'd he go? I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
Well, me I guess. So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time yes I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
I'm easy, but I'm not that easy. See you later, handsome.
Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
No.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
Um... I don't know. What time did hockey end?
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
Then who operated the store?
With this guy locked in?
She thought it was me.
Pack of cigarettes.
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
Well, I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive.
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
How'bout covering point!? You suck!
They certainly do. Two fifty five.
Well, he missed!
This is the last time I ever come here. And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open!
Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right?
So?
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
That's what I said.
What smells like shoe polish?
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule. Is the Pelican flying?
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
Who was on your phone this morning at about two thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
I wanted to use your car.
She called me.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
You win.
Seven months.
Five years.
Eight and a half.
Party at John K's senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
She called me Brad.
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Great story, isn't it?
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
Allan Harris.
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
It takes different strokes to move the world.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple. That's what high school's all about algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
I'm talking to myself here.
... and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
I think it's safe to say yes.
All four?
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Empire.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett. It ends on such a down note. And that's life a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
The Emperor.
How do you mean?
I guess.
Yeah.
It would stand to reason, yes.
More or less.
I think they were Catholics.
So they build another Death Star, right?
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it something just wasn't right.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army storm troopers, dignitaries the only people onboard were Imperials.
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main? All they know is killing and white uniforms.
All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed casualties of a war they had nothing to do with. All right, look you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two story in suburbia this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three mile radius. You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living.
She's in here?
Perfect dozen.
The quest isn't going well?
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
What's a jizz mopper?
Nudie booth?
I guess not.
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do. These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening. He's led a very sheltered life.
The jizz mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
There aren't.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
The milkmaids.
Which ones?
Because my ex girlfriend is getting married.
Veronica!
The best Burtless movie ever made.
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
So, what you're stuck here all day?
Why'd you apologize?
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
Because you buckled.
Don't yell at me, pal.
See? There you go again.
At least we're stuck here together.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to.
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Then where're we gonna play?
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink?
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
Julie Dwyer died.
No, I'm serious.
How? When?
Jesus.
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
Number six.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
Why not?
What!?
Shit. What about tomorrow?
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
You hardly knew her!
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
You hate people.
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
She meant nothing to you!
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
I can't close the store.
Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
An embolism in a pool.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Broke his neck.
He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.
Stop it.
Oh, my god.
No!
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
Who found him?
His dick was in his mouth?
He made it, hunhh?
You know.
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
Her fucking body fell out!
Just... go! Go open the video store.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
I want to rent a movie.
May I be blunt with you?
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which though it may seem cruel and unusual does include manning our posts until closing.
There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
Jesus!
What?
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
Please, get the hell out of here.
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
I like to expand my horizons.
No way!
You're bullshitting.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
Really?
Holy shit. That girl?
Then how come you got the fine?
You're lying.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're happy?
You're happy to get a fine?
Now I know you're lying.
What did she say?
You're kidding.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
What happened to title dictates behavior?
Hey, what about Veronica?
You're a snake.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
There's no lights back there.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo poo; wee wee.
I think four.
This life?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
Thirty seven.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
It's the same thing with Veronica.
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school in high school for God's sake! You're twenty two!
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
Am I right or what?
What? The dead guy? She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
Make them change.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
Lovely story.
It's hard to swallow.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
Why do you say that?
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
How do you figure?
Like ten after.
To talk to you.
It's not like I'm miles away.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to you trying to pass the buck again. I'm the source of all your misery. Who closed the store to play hockey? Who closed the store to attend a wake? Who tried to win back an ex girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one? You wanna blame somebody, blame yourself. " I'm not even supposed to be here today. " You sound like an asshole. Whose choice was it to be here today? Nobody twisted your arm. You're here today of your own violation, my friend. But you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders that the store would crumble if Dante wasn't here. Well, I got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you. Without me either. All you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: You push fucking buttons. Any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. You work in a convenience store, Dante. And badly, I might add. And I work in a shitty video store. Badly, as well. You know, that guy Jay's got it right he has no delusions about what he does. Us? We like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or God forbid cigarettes. We look down on them, as it we're so advanced. Well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here?
Got one. Just pulled up.
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
I'll call you. Let you know.
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
To say the least.
Get the fuck outta here already.
Just the paper.
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
I don't know.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height dark hair gorgeous body?
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
To you?
I... I don't believe this...
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and please God get laid. E Z Wider, one and a halfs.
Pay the good man. Don't you close soon?
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out. You get high?
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
Listen to you. Oh shit. " Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers. "
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy nine for wraps what's that shit?
And these aren't my drugs I just sell them.
What's that mean?
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
At Food City it's ninety nine cents, plus tax.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why because people come here and they're like " A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there. " That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin'off.
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin'it when I saw her. Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
You used to go out with her?
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
And what you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit. Shit, my grandma used to say, " Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it... " No, wait. I fucked up. She said " What's a good looking plate with nothing on it? "
I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
I had a friend that used to chew glass for a living. In the circus.
Oh... Can I help you?
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
The white kind.
Actually, it is kind of rough.
Yeah, but...
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
Thanks, young man. You've got a heart of gold.
I said go ahead.
Here. Now leave me alone.
At least they weren't lit.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
Why did you agree to come in then?
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
You're kidding.
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
What were you doing up so late?
What were you doing?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me? I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on.
You're trusting.
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
Ooh! Can we?!
I was kidding.
Typically male point of view.
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
" Be there? "
How flattering.
Oh, you think so?
And I actually date you?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just " being there " as you put it is not enough.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
You were making a generalization about " broads! "
How many?
How many girls have you slept with?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
It better be up to and including me.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
Why'd you hit me?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Three?
You've only had sex with three different people?
Who?
No; who were the three, besides me?
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
All right. Name it.
Where?
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this.
What do you mean?
He requested this?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Like you said she snowballed him.
Yeah, right.
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
You sucked his dick!
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
Oh my God I feel so nauseous...
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
How many?
How many dicks have you sucked?!
HOW MANY?
This is different. This is important. How many?!
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY SIX?
What the hell is that anyway, " something like thirty six? " Does that include me?
I'M THIRTY SEVEN?
Thirty seven?! My girlfriend sucked thirty seven dicks!
No, but you sucked enough dick!
A few?
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
I feel sick.
Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty six other guys.
Goodbye, Dante.
What is it?
Really? You're the best.
What did he say?
And that made you feel better?
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
Thank you for being rational.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one thirty class.
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
Good. I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne.
What're you talking about?
It was only a few times...
A couple...?
Would you let me explain...
Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again and she will, Dante, I promise you that when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for! I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
Fuck you.
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
I think it's coming now...
It stings a little.
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
Check this out, he's from Russia.
I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying?
English. Come on, " Berserker! " Girls think sexy.
He is.
I do about three fifty, four.
Feel that.
Now feel his. Roll up your sleeve, chief.
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
My man is deaf. I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY! Neh.
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
I'll see you there.
I... I don't know what to say.
I'm not sad.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it! He has his friend do it for him!
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
No, I'm just visiting my man. Dante, this is Willam Black. This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
I will. Take it easy.
Bye That was Snowball.
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin'off the Tower today. C'mon with us.
Next time you're like watching MTV, y'know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out. I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
Exactly, cheesehead, exactly.
Who's shooting?
Cursin'. That's a penalty kick for unsportsmanlike conduct, mate.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
Rooster! Forget the hen stuff. Be safe, honey. Over.
Surprise me.
A monkey?
Y'know, Jessie, doesn't Frank look like a normal guy but he's not, are you Frank?
This is where your background in police work comes in handy ask the questions, Travers.
Suits, underwear, 100 million dollars... the usual stuff. Travers was smart enough to bring along a tracking device. Step into my office.
Copy. Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
The money!
I think it's out. No big deal. It's that old football injury.
I love you, too.
Wait'til you get into trouble, just wait.
The clip's not gonna hold!
Now let me fill you in. You can get your ass back down an'go back to that hole you been hiding in
You're gone now! I don't climb with people I can't trust. Why'd you come up, to prove something?
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it
We'll never know, will we?
What the hell do you know about bad time. You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
Hey, about everything that happened with Sarah. I know you did what you could
Take the gun.
Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind...
Can I count as fast as I like?
I'm sorry for all the trouble... Thank you.
Three...
Six...
You're not gonna die. Grab me with your other hand!
That's a virtue isn't it?
You can stop right there.
Enough.
Oh, please.
Where've you been?
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought out reason.
Had to leave? Believe me, we all wanted to leave... but you know what? We stayed.
I know...
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic. So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt. You held on as long as you could. Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I don't understand?
You're saying, I don't understand? I'm the only one who does understand. I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all. Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you. But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I understand you.
Excuse me?
Did I miss something?
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Resuscitation?
Which could maybe what?
A flare up...
Listen to you... The old " mouth to mouth " resuscitation routine, huh?
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
Where?
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave... This was our home, now it's my home. I can't leave. You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it. And you shouldn't either.
And I can't leave.
You know where everything is... I'm late for my shift.
That's not the issue here, those people are. He can't do it alone.
What if he can't?
You mean the nerve.
Looking for Hal. Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open... you came back.
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked. You look frozen. What's happening?!
Where's Hal, what's going on?
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too. Why'd you have to come up here?!
Yeah, let's go.
Don't worry about me, just go.
I can't believe you just said that.
Making things real rough for Hal.
Remember the first time we came up here?
It was great.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
No, actually it was more like mutual attacking.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
A simple yes or no would have done.
Cute.
Start pulling it apart! We're climbing down on it.
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300. I'm 190, you're about 135 it just may hold.
Never, what?!
Helluva time for vanity!
Do it, goddammit!
I'm holding you to that. Gabe, what about Frank?
There's no " we ". There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
" Time is money " please.
What about you?
We don't have time to argue about it!
Take the rope.
Take the rope.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
An'if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Can't do it. Now go back and get help!
And miss all of this peace and quiet? Never, right Hal?
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Now you get burned.
No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market. Except you, the loyal one. Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
Tucker and Walker, we've lost three bags.
You're looking at him.
Bob and Rick are in Denver. I gotta get up there as fast as possible. Frank, get me a load of flares.
Do you always transport through the air?
These are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause.
Why? What are you going to do?!
You're both with the mountain rescue team?
Down there you buy a life, up here you earn it or die. How's your health?
Give me the fucking code!
No names, this is an open line!
Get off the radio!
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
Appreciate it.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
What did you do that for?
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
Doobidoob... a bit tired maybe, everybody is. A long night for growing malchicks... best not to say more. Bedways is rigthways now, so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right.
Been punished, yeah?
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Long time, is right. I don't remember them days too horrorshow. Don't call me Dim no more, either. Officer, call me.
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
Very well, madam. I suppose you can't be blamed for being suspicious with so many scoundrels and rouges of the night about. Alex walks away from door, then ducks into the bushes where the others are hiding. They put on their maskies and follow Alex round to the rear of the house.
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
Hullo.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Much better, thank you, sir.
Fine, sir, fine.
Thank you very much, sir.
What would you like to know, sir?
Yes, sir. Rubinstein takes out a notebook.
You've not been to school all week, son.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Hullo love, how are you? Nice to see you, Dad.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice cubes.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
As an unmuddied lake, sir. Clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, sir. Deltoid drinks again but this time sees the teeth in the glass. He groans and retches.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
It will be your own torture. I hope to God it will torture you to madness.
Well, we go round shop crasting and the like, coming out with a pitiful rookerful of money each.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
What crime did you commit.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Good.
Fine. Absolutely fine. You see, Ladies and Gentlemen our subject is, you see, impelled towards good by paradoxically being impelled toward evil. The intention to act violently is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress. To counter these, the subject has to switch to a diametrically opposed attitude. Any questions? Priest rises and moves to Alex.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Where is he now, sir?
What job and how much?
Helping you, sir?
Well, who can blame them, sir?
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
Surprise?
Thank you, Fred. Thank you. Minister turns and signals. Door opens and a crowd of cameramen and reporters rush in. Aides push two 6 foot loudspeakers and a Hi Fi on a trolley.
Fine, fine.
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Aye. Glad to see you back, lad.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy wunching lomticks of toast.
How do you do, Joe? Find the room comfortable, do you? No complaints?
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
What do I want?
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
You want to know why I did that, well you see I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
I'm gonna be sick.
I wanna be sick.
Let me get up.
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
Fucking hell...
Oh hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
It's a stinking world because there's no law and order any more. It's a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old like you done. It's no world for an old man any more. What sort of a world is it at all? Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth and there's not no attention paid to earthly law and order no more. The Tramp starts singing again.
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
Then there was like a sea of dirty, smelly old men trying to get at your humble Narrator, with their feeble rookers and horny old claws. It was Old Age having a go at Youth and I daren't do a single solitary thing, O my brothers, it being better to be hit at like that, than want to be sick and feel that horrible pain. The Tramp crowd round Alex, shouting.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
I've done my best, have I not?
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
Father may I ask you a question in private?
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
Yeah... Pete the English.
Big, big money.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that we're not very pleased to see you again. All cured too, eh?
Cram criminals together and what do you get concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Not a chance, my dear fellow. The Ggovernment can't be concerned any longer with outmoded penological theories. Soon we may be needing all of out prison space for political offenders. Common criminals like these are best dealt with on a purely curative basis. Kill the criminal reflex that's all. Full implementation in a year's time. Punishment means nothing to them, you can see that... they enjoy their so called punishment. Alex seizes his chance as they pass by.
Sixth is faster.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
First Friday of the month? Linens. Roll right off the trucks. They're in and out in twenty minutes...... which means they left fifteen minutes ago. Traffic will be smooth.
The ride is free.
No. You were right, I was wrong...... Max.
Let me guess. Clarinet?
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Keep it. Go wild. Have a party.
It's no big deal.
There were two of us. I had the other guy killed. Don't need the competition...
Like what?
Sure. I'm starting an 800 hotline. Caught part of your phone call. And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top of the line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
... Bottega. Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer. You? Definitely Clarence Darrow.
Yeah.
But not now?
You need a vacation.
Not in a cab... I mean a disconnection... get your head straight... you know, get it together...
Soon. But I take little ones all the time. Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
Dozen times a day.
Max, the cab driver!
Listen to me! Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
Kill you! He's coming to kill you!
Dmitri hired him! He's already killed all your witnesses, now he's coming after you! He was stalking you when I dropped you off. I don't know what happened, but he diverted and got into my cab, instead.
Where are you, what floor?
He doesn't know you're up there! Just stay right where you are! Call the police!
Yes! Stay put, goddamn it! Don't move from that spot...
You still carrying passengers?
This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it. Get you towed. Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk. I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab.
You sure? You look pretty shaky...
Right through those doors. The man himself.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show. After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk. That's how he was, you see. Never forgot where he came from. Money and fame an'all that? Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn. So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin'his thing.
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence. Louis was playing. God was smiling.
Did better'n that.
Get outta here! You and Louis?
Unbelievable...... you hearing this? Unbelievable.
The crowd had to dig it.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
I know the answer. I know all there is to know about Louis.
Sorry?
Neither do I. But my children, they're still young. Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas? His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids. That was Black Peter's job. He was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night. And if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door. That was a warning. If they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. And they would never be seen again.
What? What did you say?
You tell me. I had to toss the list in the river. I was protecting your sorry, long winded ass. So why don't you show a little courtesy?
The fat man on Cherry Street. The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer. The trumpet player. That leaves two.
In fifteen years, I have never left a customer unsatisfied.
Hell, make it fifty. Same goes for any business we have in the future.
By the way. Daniel said he was sorry.
... so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo. That guy? That guy is a cabbie. And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze'em in between fares?
You guys been holding hands?
Dmitri Gusunov? What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him. They're a heartbeat away from taking him down. Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
What homicide? Phil. Where's a body? Look. All we got is glass...
Cabbie drove around all night. Three people got killed.
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
I never bought that.
Cabbie had no criminal record, no history of mental illness. Suddenly, he just wigs out and pops three people, then himself? Plus the victims weren't random solid citizens. They were all lowlives. Wiseguys. I've always wondered if there was someone else in the cab.
Joey Cicerno. Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov. Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
... if they're wrong?!
It's nothing.
Tell me about it.
Vincent...
Of course!
I got caught up at work.
I brought you flowers.
You're gonna cheer up.
He paid for'em.
I'm standing right here.
I got my, my hands taped to the steering wheel here, there's this guy, he taped me in the car, he's back there somewhere.
My hands are taped to the fucking steering wheel!
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
Tell it to Max. Tell him he's an asshole.
Maaaaaax!
Same fare you talked to last time. The U. S. Attorney...
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Hang on. Carefully...
It got crashed! I didn't...
... I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
... what do you want me to do, punch him out? I have to work with him...
Twenty four? Not twenty five? Or twenty three?
It's home.
I see your point.
You prefer nights?
You on some kind of work plan?
Yeah. Retirement? Paid sick leave?
You should start a union.
Why not?
Oh? How long you been doing this?
Like what?
None taken. There are talkers and doers. I like doers.
Bullshit. You probably know the light schedules, too. Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing. Five stops, one night. I gotta catch a six a. m. flight. I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures. Why don't you hang with me?
Regulations? These guys don't even give you sick leave. How much you pull down on a good night?
I'll make it an even five hundred. Plus an extra hundred if you get me to LAX on time.
Max? I'm Vincent.
Yeah, yeah. Shit, man. Guy fell on my motherfucking cab.
No. You say you're cool.
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX. Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator. So we go to Plan B. Pop the trunk.
Did I stutter? The trunk. Unless you want him riding up front with you... but given hygiene and his sphincters have let go...
It's just a dead guy. On three, ready? Uno. Dos. Three.
It's a spasm! Jesus, Max, don't be such a girl...
Try harder. I'm gonna count to three. One...
It's not me, it's the engine! A fat guy fell on it from six floors up!
How about the thingy next to it?
I'm making you nervous. I'm the one with a schedule.
Adrenaline's wearing off. You get shaky after. It's not uncommon. Deep breathing helps.
So?
How long, you figure?
You said you were visiting friends!
Listen. I'm not trying to piss you off, see? Okay? I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
You don't understand. I mean it. Really. I'm not up for this...
What else calms you down? Candy? Cigarettes? Sex? Breathe.
I didn't throw him, he fell.
Nothing. I only met him the one time.
I should only kill people after I get to know'em? Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape'cause of one fat guy?
What do you care? Ever hear of Rwanda?
Tens of thousands killed before sundown. Nobody's killed that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Did you bat an eye, Max? Join Amnesty International? No. I off one Angeleno, you throw a hissy fit...
Oh, it's okay, then.'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
You're a cabby. Like talk yourself out of a ticket?
I can't believe this.
Because I have a gun and I say so.
So what?
No you don't.
Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna kick your fat ass.
Collateral damage.
People in the wrong place at the wrong time. Draws attention, which is something you avoid in my line of work. And for you? You attract attention, you're gonna get people killed who don't need to be.
Am I collateral?
Jazz. Music.
Friend of mine told me about this great place in South Central. Says it's like the birthplace of West Coast bebop. Bird. Dexter Gordon. Thelonious Monk. Chet Baker. I'll buy you a drink. Expand your horizons...
God, are you always this prosaic? You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're taught. It's like breathing, like life. Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
Damn right. Instinct, man. If you think too much, it doesn't work. Just listen...
That's the point. You play between the notes, you dance around the structure, you improvise. Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now. Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over. That's not living. That's dying a little every day. Not me, pal. It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living. That's jazz. That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about. Hell, it's the same thing he's talking about, if you just open your ears. You can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet...
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow. You like the man, you like the way he plays. How about a little jazz, huh?
What you mean, no?
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop. I'm not playing.
You go every night?
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention. That's bad. And that's not good...
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
Maybe so. Maybe she hears what you tell her.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you... I had a father like that.
He hated everything I did. Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
I killed him. When I was 15. He was my first. Nah, wishful thinking. Liver cancer.
Don't be. I never saw him after I was 15. Went into the military early. So all this talk about " my job's temporary, I got big plans, " it's all bullshit.
What do you call it? Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me. I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
Yeah? Like what? Limos?
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now. When you leaving?
What, no insurance?
Good excuse. How many others you got?
The man who hired me for this contract.
You're gonna be me. You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way. Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
Max. You threw my briefcase in the river. You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
That's jazz, my friend. You said it yourself. So don't tell me you don't know how to play between the notes.
In case he asks.
You get benefits?
Paid sick leave?
You do impress me, Max. That you do.
Your lady friend. The one who gave you her business card. Think she was just being polite?
What holds you back, Max? Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
It's not what you owe me. Time is so fleeting. One day it's gone. You make it out of this alive, Max, you really should call her. That's what I think.
Who's Heller?
I shoulda saved him'cause he believed you?
Yeah, that.
It's what I do for a living.
Head towards Union Station.
How are you at math? I was hired for five hits. I did four.
There you go...!
You're too good. We're in this together. Fates intertwined. Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
I'm full of shit? You're a monument of bullshit. You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage. Bad guys killing bad guys...
And you believe me...?
How do I know? But, they all got that " witnesses for the prosecution " look to me. Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted... I dunno.
That's the " why. " That's the why? There is no reason. No good reason; no bad reason. To live or to die.
... indifferent.
As in...?
... all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X ray vision...
Look in the mirror.... piss ant paper towels... a bottle of 409... saving up for goin'to the Comoros. How much you got saved?
... pie in the sky? " Someday my dream'll come... " But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old. It hasn't happened. It never will. Life just flipped on you. Tomorrow became yesterday. Then you'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen, anyway, and push it back in memory... and anesthetize yourself in a Barcalounger with daytime TV for the rest of your life... Don't talk to me about murder. You're do in'yourself... in this yellow prison with steel belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday...
I should have done that. Fixed it and more. Get out from under what I been under...
Slow down!
The F. B. I., the C. I. A. You name the initials and they're down there.
All I know is, they said to send you and the body to the basement.
I live on tips, so don't be offended, but you're a liar. I saw you kiss. Admit it, this is the street where love lives.
Geronimo. When you're really in love, you'll jump. Off the top of the Empire State. Screaming'Geronimo'the whole way down.
Aren't you listening, man? Love gives you wings.
I, uh, I have some problems.
You turned up a one way street!
Look, I'm sorry
Tell you what. Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Sure. And the two of'em used my legs for a wishbone. Nearly snapped me in half.
Sure was. Pounded the V. C. for this Greek cat named Ari Onasis.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
Not for years.
Well, I Jerry, the point. Get there. What does it have to do with the President?
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry. We're talking billions. Motive enough?
Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
You think I'm crazy.
You know, to be'normal'and live in the'real world,'to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy against yourself. I can't lie to me, Liza. And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on? You want to go out sometime?
Was waiting till I knew you better. Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.
Yes! Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!
You're the boss. Just don't make me repeat myself. I hate that.
What?
Love.
You switched the charts; you tell me.
Really?
You saved my life.
I can't promise you anything.
Figure of speech. Could we go?
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald. Another lunatic acting alone,
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Uh uh, don't want them to see me.
Change lanes. Then watch your rearview.
Crown Victoria. F. B. I. car. A legitimate tail.
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
Yes.
I noticed.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
Till today, I haven't believed a word. Now, I'm curious. Six months, eleven days. I'm going to give you one more hour to impress me. Where to?
And look here. Cease fire in Chechenia. That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons. Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado. Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive. They've accused the E. P. A. of, quote,'turning a blind eye to the future. '
What newsletter?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
The whole kit and caboodle of'em are British Intelligence agents. Spies. Jerry Garcia had a double o rating. Just like James Bond.
Are these yours?
Stone is their spokesman. You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it? Stone's a disinformation flunky. The face that he's alive says it all.
Absolutely not. A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy. If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
You got a list?
Holden Caulfield? Catcher in the Rye?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Has this happened to you before?
Who are you, Jerry?
Shoot.
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context. Know what I mean?
So what's the question?
That was him.
Please put it down.
He was murdered.
You run with your back to the picture. Like you were trying to get away. Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
Never mind. You'd think I was making it up.
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board. I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Jesus... It's my fault. They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on. I'm passing it to you, too.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse. I should have realized.
Henry Finch. That they monitor everything. That it was only a matter of time. And now four people are dead.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
Murdered?
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool. In Newport.
Where then?
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
Do you watch the news? Read the paper. Last week, this whole place was underwater.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot? Harriman Tower. Their sub basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool. Call the coroner in Rhode Island! Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
You will?
I know that. I'm just I'm nervous. I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics. And I know how I feel.
Oh, Christ, here it comes. Look, I know you think I'm crazy. I don't think I am, but...
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore? If I was normal.
Yeah... Would you, I mean, could you love me then? If I was normal. Maybe?
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall. How it was possible.
It's Geronimo. Love. It lets you see things. It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
I don't. I know you wouldn't.
It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you. But first things first.
Connecticut.
John Hinkley. The guy who shot Reagan. He only had two names.
Is that what they told you?
I don't understand.
At a horse show.
Did you kill my father?!
Then tell me what happened.
Love at first sight?
Back where?
Why? What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
Why not?
I'm sorry.
Get up there and we'll get it back down here for me. Now.
Don't do this.
Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry? Who else knows what you know?
You shouldn't watch, Jerry. It's a moment without hope.
I like that. A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay. May have a headache for a few days. Are you here with honorable intentions?
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow. But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you. Does that seem honorable?
That's your option. Ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time. In case you didn't know it, you're crazy.
That's not what I mean. I want to see her.
Then screw you. I'll rot.
Whatever.
Excuse me?
And you feel bad for it?
And you have no idea where he lives?
Here's a fresh one. Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
Why you?
A charming term. Now, why him?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them? Why him?
That's it. I went to Yale. I hope you won't hold that against me.
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
Please, sit.
A vulgar pop term, but yes. Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin. That was our goal.
M. K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed. EX CATCHER.
I am impressed. We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.
As in'resulting in death.'We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
Me? I was a minor missionary, a heretic really. But where else could a red blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All Highs? Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
It was. It was.
A dog.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
I don't believe you.
So you'll believe what I tell you next. Because I need to find Jerry. And I don't think I can do that without you.
It was my father's. Kept it in his wallet. He was murdered
Not a man. Ezekiel Walters.
You sound so sure.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
Night after that?
I'm not that good at'no,'Liza.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
It makes perfect sense. Field work is not our oeuvre.
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate. Why is that?
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza. What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions. We're out. Shut off. Terminated. Understood?
While we walk. D. C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies. No one knows what the C. I. A. wants him for.
Jonas?
I want to believe you, too.
He's why I watch Jerry. Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
Jonas builds assassins for a living. Several of whom may be in place already. We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
No idea. Honest. What are you going to do?
Don't go home. And don't go to work. Either one could be bad.
That you come with me.
Anything happening in there, El?
There's no plug to pull.
There is no abort procedure we don't know how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off.
He died...... in 1972.
Dr. Arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode.
Dr. Arroway, let me first say
Still settling in, really. Where's Dr. Arroway?
Last week, about 3 A. M., Fish Dr. Fisher was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine. She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the Maytag. Listening.
I'm not. You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense
And only two probabilities: One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime
Two: There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
I disagree.
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
Now exactly. It's... complicated.
Ellie...
You know why I'm here.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N. S. F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt
It's not like you've given me much choice.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
No... You're not. But the price has just gotten too high.
Then why haven't you detected any signals? If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through? It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
It was a worthy experiment worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty six years. As for why... I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science. This could be a chance to win him over.
Ellie
It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a fact if you're not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly. Play ball. Really. It's good advice.
You mean
Do you have a minute?
It'll just take a moment.
I'm asking for your help, David. I want to go. They'll need someone relatively young, unattached and probably a scientist. As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
What?
Right. Well.
Nothing. I guess I just wanted to thank you.
For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.
VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
Ellie. Pulsar?
Nice. Where?
It's how I hear it. The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too.
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
And a hundred mile airspace.
That's terrific, but there's one problem: we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own.
I don't have an official response, Michael. All I have are the same questions you have.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
By our standards... yes.
Thank you, Doctor. Now
Try again between the static and'Hey Jude'; that's where they're hiding.
Just be yourself, Captain. Find out where he is.
Could we hear to the moon?
Could we hear God?
Okay, okay... there.
Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
So. Are you an hallucination? Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...? When I was unconscious. You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even... This beach. I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined... Pensacola.
Can you show me?
Why did you contact us?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
So who...?
The scale... it's just... So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
So we passed some kind of test?
So. What happens now?
No! I mean... why so soon?
None taken... but... do we get to come back? Others of my kind, I mean.
That isn't the way it works.
No more stalling, Captain.
Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years...
Childhood is over, Ellie. It's time to grow up.
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
What kind of deal?
I didn't realize I was out.
You've... found it. What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
Even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission. Heaven is the mustard seed.
A machine. But a machine that does what?
And in return?
Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her. And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out. That's Paris, where my daughter was born. Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking. So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang. As if it never happened. If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed.
What are you talking about? It's over.
You sound like Joseph. You think the world ends with the millennium?
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
Mmm. Look closer.
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
Sounds like a Russian general.
What a coincidence. It happens to be my fetish too.
It's like the pre Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made. I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven to someone even a hundred years ago I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
'... is indistinguishable from magic. '
Please. Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N. S. F. I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing. Still, we've barely started...
It's almost there. The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
The V. L. A.?
Peter if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you we could!
We could be together again
Greenbank?
But what about your research?
But the work
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more
And you think I don't want those things? You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday? Let's get married.
Right now we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
I'm serious about this, Peter
You sonofabitch.
That you, Valerian?
Like it. Almost there.
Thank God. When we lost contact, I thought we thought... but you're okay. We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction. Did you notice anything at all that
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe
What day?
But the machine worked that's what I've been trying to tell everyone! The tape it's all there, if they'd just look at...... the tape...
I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet. For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
Spoken like a true believer.
How do you mean?
' My father's house has many mansions. '
So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch.
That's not doubt. That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct. I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
I had... an experience. Of belonging. Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent. But this experience went beyond both. For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
Do you love your parents?
Did you love him?
Prove it.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Not exactly. It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
I don't think so.
It's too... elegant. The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D. N. A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
In other words.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
And everybody you care about would be dead and buried.
It's what my whole life's been... aimed at; the only thing that's given it a sense of purpose.
Losing Faith: The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
I thought it was well written. Heart felt. And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here?
What are you so afraid of, Ellie?
How do you mean?
Oh. I brought you something.
Maybe that's okay.
What is it?
What?
What are you so afraid of?
What are my other options? In fifty years? Never?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
And then what? Then you'll be safe?
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor? Is that why you're so quick to risk it because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
Pretty ironic, huh? I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
They don't believe me.
You're sure you want to? In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show. What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
It's not enough, don't you understand? I know it happened but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point. It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
But
I want to, Palmer more than anything. But it has to be real. It has to be true.
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
I'm not sure... Maybe it simply exists in the search for it. Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
Something my dad they said.'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.'The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal
But I made this arrangement
Buck is a deal.
Yeah. Well. Gettin'up here, Boss.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on'em.
Smokin'it up here, Boss.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
We call it abuildin'time, Arletta.
Yeah, would of been nice to of knowed him, the way you talk about him.
What went wrong?
No.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin'got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin'the hell out of all of us.
I'm leavin'the place to John.
Nothin'to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin'I give you, so I'm payin'him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin'for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.
You don't know!
Don't hit me! Please, for God's sake, don't hit me.
Supposin'you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin'you was to backsass or try to run again...
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Cuttin'the heads off parkin'meters, Captain.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
That's right, Captain. Just passin'the time.
Went down to see this old hag and she had needles the size of that cane.
Mister Cool Hand here is the soft heart in our Loan Department. Next!
I kin see that, brick head. I mean your hole card.
So then you just call him.
Shut up. Let him eat. Don't pay them no mind, boy.
A cold drink? Okay?
Well, whatta we got here?
You tryin'to say somethin'?
Innocent?
Boy. You jus'asking to be handled!
Cool Hand Luke.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol'belly of yours git it all strained out, in fightin'shape, like a barrage balloon.
' Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Us elephants may be a lil slow, like in makin'love, but you give us a coupla three days to really get with it an'man stand back!
And all the time you was plannin'on runnin'again.
What you talkin'about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
What you mean, Luke?
Luke. Where you goin?
But what am I gonna do all by myself? Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin'down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
Do we even get our same bunks back?
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
Like I always do?
Bet! Babalugats, bet here!
Cuter again.
Fat mile'n a half. Hit this red light, highway patrol pulls up alongside.
You threatened to drive her downtown. She has agoraphobia.
Open space. She hasn't been out of this apartment in three years. I didn't used to think it was real...
I had the dream again. And I got another call. This time he spoke. He said " You and me, you and me. "
He whispered, but it was him! I know it was him!
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
But earlier, he was staring up here. Please, Andy.
I want to die.
You slut! No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.
Get out! All of you!
Look out for her. She's tougher than you think.
Gaahhd! What a cop! You busted me! The new one, in the Marina. She has a police radio scanner. It's always on. She turns it off, and then she has to turn it on again. She's obsessed. She can't not listen to it, but she can't listen to it, so she makes me listen to it.
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
He was lying.
I thought he was lying.
Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears. Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear.
The same as the first time...
He told me he had done two others just like it.
When he was seventeen.
Yes. I believed him.
I was? How you spell that?
I never hurt nobody...
I never carried a gun!
Doesn't work that way. You had your chance, now fuck yourself...
I don't have it...
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing. We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday. He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
What day is this? In jail you lose track. This week. Friday.
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift? Where is it?
Where is it?
The door was already open...
She's supposed to have it.
What book?
I will. I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it. Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
Ah ha. What did he want?
I don't know. I'd like to know where he is.
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll. And maybe you're right, that's the place.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
In jail.
You like that action? Didn't that cop on TV look solemn? The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
You thought I was going to do Ted Bundy next, so you sent your partner...
Mm hmm. I can't get to you. You have to come to me.
Oh, I think you will.
You've been perfect. Don't spoil the symmetry you have to have a male cop.
Where it began McCluskey Auditorium.
Do it. If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it. Have enough guts to do it.
Why did you do that? Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far? I worshipped you. You inspired me. I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others. I knew that about you the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
I don't have the talent for any of those things. All I have a talent for is death. And I am one of a kind. What do you think of your student now? I have made you famous, I am your creation and your monument.
Back in the driver's seat again, Doctor? That old dream study us to see what makes us sick. So you can find a cure they'd name it after you? Death is the only cure for people like me.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am? Do you know any of the victims...
That's an opinion, not evidence...
Who?
Because of your phone calls.
You called us, Doctor Hudson.
Would you want to work with us on this?
I think you are. I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here. I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts. I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
You can't go out lecturing? Tough shit. Women are dying. Where can I lay this stuff out?
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close. Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
He felt remorse. He covered her.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo. He used their own stockings to strangle them. Tied in a bow knot.
Work with me.
He won't.
Maybe that's why you can't catch him. I know what she looks like the red headed woman in my computer.
Because I'm his damned pin up girl! His, all of them! They know me. They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, I'm their worthy opponent. You keep my name out of this.
I want a guard on you. I'm worried about leaving you alone.
But it's a different m. o.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says " no dumping. " Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose. It's all different but it seems so the same. Artificial and posed... Something's wrong with it.
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him. Where's the on switch?
Helen the killer directly contacted you. His interest in you is intense. I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you. I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him. So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
Clint is putting a guard on you. But if you swear to leave the computer on, Winona will assign him to the hall outside.
Please thank Inspector Goetz for taking care of me last night.
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
Injected Windex! Why would he switch to a new m. o.?
He'll get caught. If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
You're afraid of him.
I'm giving you Clint outside.
I did not; the Mouth that's what we call Susan Schiffer got it on her own.
Because I'm all you've got.
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a. 44. It's Son of Sam. Is it Son of Sam?
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ! Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button. Just give me a minute here. The letter is addressed to me... You don't feel fear, do you? You're young. You feel like you'll live forever. How wonderful.
They weren't going to show it to me?! The arrogance! It's my life!
It's not chronological: Son of Sam was before Hillside.
You do that one, I don't want it...
A man? I thought he was a boy. This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why? It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love. Son of a bitch married men! Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
Where's the john? Let me clean up this mess, and get back to work.
Maybe you should...
Out. Where does he go? Nowhere. What does he do? Nothing.
Christ, Helen. The first time, we're ahead of the son of a bitch! I can't leave you like this and there's no time. Knock yourself out.
Helen let go. You've got to let go.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life. I'm going home. I'm going to try to get drunk.
Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn self righteous.
In the sixties. He's dead stabbed to death in prison.
He can get into my computer any time he likes! This is exactly the kind of thing I didn't want to have happen.
He's brilliant. This one is brilliant.
MaryJane. You think that logic and police procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night. I did once. But you know how he'll get caught? He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky. You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard. Or the worst: there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month. The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark. And then, one day, there are no more. What happened? Did he just stop? Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? Did he kill himself? Did he die in an auto accident? Or a fight. Or get sick and die? It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth. And you never know. But you keep asking yourself when you read about a new murder is he back?
Will you stay? Please? I'm afraid to sleep... I don't want... him... in my head...
She on the passenger side?
Listen to me. Is there a gas station nearby?
They all have one...
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer. Stay put.
Just get out of your vehicle...
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
We know Helen. She's not exactly a credible collaborator. Especially late in the day...
Who prescribes the brandy?
Okay.
Michael Johnson.
No. I didn't.
Who came in after you?
Not what I meant; why me?
You're shitting ion your career. You outrank hi...
Don't put yourself down like that. I never used you. I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
God, you're cute when you're mad.
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
Don't ever forget how good you are.
Sure. She likes you, Rube. She likes the way you move. She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
Order Chinese for us and meet me the library? Anything but beef.
Nada. Lemme make the call.
I like women like that!
Needle marks, fresh, here. look at this...
Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.
Yeah, everything's different.
You damn well better start working on that impulse control. A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of evidence?
The woman's unstable. You could wind up with a harassment charge. Anything. You're like some horny little teenager.
Talk to Nikko...!
I said you were...
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love. The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson. Work the clues.
Would you step outside, Sergeant?
How about I put Nikko on it?
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo. Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green. Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile. Cross check ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling. If they've got a German wife. We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
So. Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
We could use a little help.
Christ. How old are you? You sure you want to be in this line of work?
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on? You got no discipline in your operation.
What the hell you need her for?
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self discipline.
Just, I need results. And I am short handed. Who else am I gonna give him?
How'd you get in on the deal?
You have no authority to make a deal like that. That's for the D. A...
Saks. If he knew you did that! They're all asking me,'what is she doing,'as it is.
Nikko?
I just got here. Talk to you later...
We were together six years, sir!
She knows I'm Catholic! She never mentioned divorce! Not once!
I don't want the job. Don't do that to her. She's worked too damned hard for it.
You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself. Where're you?
She doesn't lie! You sure you fed her?
That's what I don't know. Why would you lie? That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie.
Did you come?
We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set...
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
He was a chemical engineer with a food company.
What!? They brought the car here?
Have you seen it?
It's about time.
After being bombarded endlessly by road safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in an actual accident.
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly they should leave them lying around for months.
No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
Maybe I am a little. James, I've got to leave for the office. Are you going to be all right?
Do you find him attractive?
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
Have you seen his penis?
Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him? Would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his anus? Tell me, describe it to me. Tell me what you would do. How would you kiss him in that car? Describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans, then take out his penis. Would you kiss it or suck it right away? Which hand would you hold it in? Have you ever sucked a penis? Do you know what semen tastes like? Have you ever tasted semen? Some semen is saltier than others. Vaughan's semen must be very salty...
I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?
One of my suitors.
Not yet. It's only beginning.
They said it was here. They told me this morning.
Can I give you a lift? I somehow find myself driving again.
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
So why the airport?
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
Isn't that rather too close...?
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
I'm sure the police would make an exception in your case.
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
You're kidding.
You're not jealous, are you? You have to understand... Helen and I had this strange, intense... experience together.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus'Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
The case could be made.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
It's hospital policy...
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
Patient.
I want to see my mother immediately.
I don't think you understand. I won't wait.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee. I can take care of myself.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
I don't need a lecture. I care about Michael.
I don't want to hear anymore.
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
What?
Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
It was just a little going away gesture.
Oh?
Maybe if we had them both to dinner or something.
Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
Yeah, it'll be fun.
Everything's ready for tomorrow night except the artillery.
Really?
What about the souffle? Has that gone in?
It'll be fine.
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
You're slowing.
And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?
But what am I going to do?
I can't. I can't see him there.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
I know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night.
What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again?
What if it's got a pattern?
It's no big deal. We all compare.
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
Was it bad news the visit from Peter?
It was romantic. He's very romantic.
Guess.
A small price.
No.
Rendezvous at the closet in 30.
A rose is a rose.
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
What's my rap?
I wish I could have seen that.
My Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight. Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light. But even though they end up crooked, they're still trees, just like the straight ones.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
That's where I always go when I get out.
And we'd eat Spaghetti O's in bed from the can.
I have a terrible confession.
I don't like lamb.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, " It's a good thing I love you. "
I do.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck.
So there were no problems?
And did you go to the mission?
Yeah.
All over. Did you see your new apartment?
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
List schmist. You'll remember.
Very trendy. Let's see the rest.
Let's try out the bed.
I love your apartment.
You're so wrong.
You've got one hell of a great body.
Yeah. How was the job search?
Promise?
Steak?
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
I think I should go home.
Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
I couldn't even face that one.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
How about a dance?
What?
We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly.
Silly, silly, silly.
It's hard to know where to start.
Yeah, the plans.
But that wasn't me. I didn't mean to do that.
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
Oh, God, Michael, I know. Why does everything have to be so hard?
I know I don't want to lose you. I don't think I could stand it.
I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
She's only known the guy a few months.
I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
Won't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late?
Forget I asked.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
Yeah.
Sure. Why?
I think you're overreacting.
Are you all right?
I hope it wasn't something I did.
Yes, I suppose so.
Especially now.
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
I just wish we'd done it sooner.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1. 5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines. Letty?
So will you?
That's a load off my mind.
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
Who?
Have you been seeing another teacher?
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney tune that you misguidedly think is love?
No way. You keep the ring. You'll come to your senses.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
How's work going? Are you back at school?
What?
Michael. Yes.
I'm really sorry.
Who?
Marcel?
Oui.
No.
Oui.
Should I call you back?
Take what you've got and get out of there.
Good. I have a job for you in America.
The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
I don't trust anyone. You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all, you are a thief. It's in your nature to steal. I'm just protecting my investment.
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
And?
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
Good word.
Uh, no
You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
But you were there?
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony?
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
And the other half?
I only have your word for that.
Where are you staying?
You have something for me?
What kind of business?
I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
Because you're the closest.
Jesus!
We'll see.
I'm going to kill him myself!
I thought they came with batteries.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
Everyone get some sleep. We're leaving in the morning.
You're sure?
This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.
I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.
I'll be Elvis and you
No. Chicks dig me.
We have to find Sophie.
Some bread and...
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
Does it really matter what I say?
I will.
Guns. Can you get them?
Don't bullshit me.
I've got a way with people.
I'm from Belgium.
Why haven't you turned us in?
A thousand dollars?
Hey you guys are becoming famous. I was just watching the news and
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
I'll tell you when it's time.
I just thought that
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Oh yeah.
There must be half a million dollars here though.
Go where? The police are outside.
Yes.
No. 145 Ridgeroad Way.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick pocketing.
Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave.
This kind.
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I? I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin'city!
That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
I've never driven a Cadillac before.
We both know I'm already dead.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
You lived there. You know the city.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
No, that's not Mr. Taylor.
Hey, you know you can't this in France.
No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin'baseball!
Give it to me, Sami.
No. It's mine.
I'm telling you that's my car! And someone's gonna pay for it!
Fuck you, grease ball!
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
You see that car?
No shit?
No thank you.
Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?
J  amp; B?
Glenmorangie is very good.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really
You wanna tell him?
It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
They're not nice people.
Did she break your heart?
It looks old. Did you get it a long time ago?
That's how you get to know someone. Did it hurt when you got it?
You got it in a bar?
Sorry. I didn't mean to pry.
I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
Sounds boring.
That's good. That's what a stand up guy does.
Yeah. I mean besides that. They treating you all right? Food okay?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
Okay. Okay.
Much better. You've been gone so long.
I'll go and make up his room!
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.
I'm looking for someone. Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district. Jade Fox is a master criminal. I hear she infiltrated the Yus. She must have come with them when they transferred here. But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Yes.
Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her. My wife was quite a martial arts expert. Jade Fox killed her. So you see, this is personal. Leave her to me.
Stop talking like a monk! Just fight!
On guard!
Why do you want to teach me?
And if I use them to kill you?
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword. Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun? You, too, are responsible for that death. Come with me. You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat. Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
You're already a thief.
Wherever we want. We'll get rid of anyone in our way. Even your father.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
Yes, you do! You are still my disciple.
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain. You know... you've gone as far as you can go. I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10. You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu. But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened! Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
Put them down.
Do you know her?
It will be just the same. Enough! I'm tired.
But I have had much practice. As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us. They'd let me play with their weapons. The scabbard is so beautiful.
Exquisite! You said it belongs to...
Li Mu Bai! The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
You're a sword fighter too?
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
You know what I mean. I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
You're not married, are you?
No! You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
I'm bored.
I'm hardly doing a thing. The less I think of it the better. My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
Am I? I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read. Like you and Li Mu Bai. I guess I'm happy to be marrying. But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
No, really?
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
Don't distance us. From now on, let's be like sisters.
I'll give them to you.
They forced me to marry!
You know about Lo?
Where is he now?
You're working together to set me up! I'm leaving!
What do I care? You were never a real friend anyway. But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Let's end this here.
All right. If you can take back the sword in three moves, I'll go with you.
Never!
You're tired. You need rest. Your horse needs water. There's a creek up here.
Still in a bad mood? At least you're speaking. What's your name?
Not true. I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong. I though you were a Han.
I don't take orders from anyone.
I am a man. And now I've found the brightest star of all.
It is trouble for me.
If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy.
Don't ever come back.
Make a wish, Lo.
Good. And how are you?
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you. My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
Why? You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
You were enlightened?
What was it?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
I don't understand. How can you part with it? It has always been with you.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
So what will you do now?
Join me once you have finished. I can wait for you in Peking.
What have you discovered?
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
Did you see who posted it?
It was Bo, Sir Te's man. I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
No, not yet...
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
What do you mean? Didn't you come back here for it?
Then, why did you come?
True. But I must borrow it for one last mission. Jade Fox must die at its edge. Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
You did your job well. But, this girl... I saw her last night.
She needs direction... and training.
That's not for her. She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
For her, they might make an exception. If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.
Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.
You're right, but I don't know what to do. I want to be with you... just like this. It gives me a sense of peace.
I'll look around and catch up later.
We followed Jade Fox.
Save your strength.
Use it to meditate. Free yourself from this world as you have been taught. Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath. Do not waste it... for me.
I heard Sir Te lost something. And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
Sir Te knows that even well meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
Yes. The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master. Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
" We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill. " Good, the fox is out of her hole.
All right. I'll act as the sword's custodian.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
I don't know...
I beg your pardon. Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
But the sword could be in his compound.
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.
This sack of shit is called Tin Tin.
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
You buying?
They make you fart.
Thanks, babe.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
The others are called Skank, T Bird. Street names. Funboy. Watch me, office Albrecht.
You went out the window. She was beaten and raped. She died in the hospital.
Thirty hours. A day of life, plus change...
Yeah, among others. Hey, man you're hit.
It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
No. I have one more thing to do.
You're welcome.
The hell you say. This isn't just about you any more.
I lost my key.
We'll discuss this later. Obviously. You left the door open.
It's just the dope, don't worry
Not me.
Mister Funboy.
He has a room, upstairs. I don't like him very much.
Does she have a name?
You gotta go now, I bet.
Elly...
You're not gonna come back, are you?
Well, how's your friend?
Oh.
I'd like to get in touch with him.
Right.
You cut her. You raped her. You watched!
Wrong answer.
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
Like the car. He hangs out with Skank. that little ass hair, and they hang at the Pit hell, Funboy lives there. Ask Top Dollar.
Of course you can. ANGLE GRANGE IN THE GALLERY in darkness. The running lights on his night scoped, laser sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
I know. That is why I will prevail. Mr. Grange...?
I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade. Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow. MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.
Does it hurt?! You dead ass, clown faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts! What the shit are you gonna do about this?!
... necklace... pearls...
Leather purse...
Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.
Mmm. But tonight I can take what is his.
Move in, guys.
Did you know Sebastian well?
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
I'm sure you're going to love it there.
Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine.
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
You heard me.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
I have his journal.
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
I know.
That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth.
No. I mean. I don't know. What else do you know about him?
What do you mean?
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen?
Okay...
Got a boyfriend back home?
Why not?
You a lesbo?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
Oh really?
How do you know I've been with several women?
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
The Fountainhead.
You've read The Fountainhead?
Romantic? He rapes her.
You need help.
At this hour? I don't think so.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
This is my favorite part. Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
I sincerely doubt it.
I never said that.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Thank you.
Shut up.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Because you act like a pig.
You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.
How are you today?
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
I said I was sorry.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
You don't even know me.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
That's none of your business.
I'm busy.
That's also none of your business.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
And you promise to abide by it?
Alright. I want you to leave and go back to New York.
If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
I'm... I'm alright.
It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
Okay?
Reading.
Somerset Maugham.
You're not gonna start that again.
Need any company?
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa.
What?
I do.
I don't.
I did. We played three games of backgammon and...
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
Lighten up.
Fine.
No?
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
Because I'm in love with you.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me?... Tell me!
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
Why can't we be together?
It's because I don't trust myself with you. I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Good for you.
Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.
Why aren't you understanding?
I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up.
But you knew this was important to me.
Wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
The football stud?
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
What do you mean?
Are you shitting me?
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Outstanding.
No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the " stroke of midnight " no pun intended?
Doctor King is my favorite.
Absolutely.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
That's great.
What are you scared of?
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me.
I guess. It still sounds gross.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Eyes closed.
What are you saying?
Is it that obvious?
Well do you like him?
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
Did you hide the letters?
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
What do you mean?!
Cecile, you have to tell me.
Does your mother know?
Why didn't you do something?
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
He made you give him a blow job.
Well what then?
What do I do then?
Well... I don't know it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.
Cool.
But I thought high school is only four years.
He'll love it.
I look terrible.
I was just kidding.
Why not?... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway.
And then I can go home?
But
I'm sorry.
No, you were fine.
Need any company?
Want a blow job?
Prude.
Your career? What about your family? Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge packer.
I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you.
Yes.
Yes!
Yes!
I'm pretty sure she did.
She bought it.
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
Where is she?!
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
One.
Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
Yeah?
What do you mean?
I'll be right there.
It's been going on for a while. Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and
You don't mean?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
B. F. D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
I'll think about it...
And if I win?
In English. I'll fuck your brains out.
Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
It would feel so yummy.
Loser.
Call me later.
Interesting.
No.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Oh sis. You're so tense.
Any day now.
Who are you spying on?
Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley. Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book.
Nothing.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her. She made me laugh.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
So? How'd it go last night?
Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
Exactly the opposite.
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified.
You don't know? She left thirty minutes ago.
She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends. You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in.
Tell me all the details.
Oh come on. For her first time?
No, tell me.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
I'm not in the mood.
It clearly is why.
And I don't.
P whipped, p whipped.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
Is that what you think?
How have you dumped girls in the past?
I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, " How do you breathe when she sits on your face? " " It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her. " Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. " I'm completely fucked up. " " I'm completely fucked up. " " I'm completely fucked up. " Poor fatty never had a chance.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
Annette?
Ronald?
You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard. Cheers.
Fine! Get off me!
Get out? We had an arrangement.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
War it is.
She really loves me.
Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Did you hit her?
Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
I suppose any note, no matter how sour, is a song if you hold on to it long enough.
Oh, you'll remember it some time.
Did you ever make a wish?
Did your wishes ever come true?
I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
But where did you get it, Amy?
The Farren house
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
She was very pretty.
Irena.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
I'm sure I don't, Alice. It's something else something moody something sickly She could almost be Irena's child.
I know that.
No. It's not that. It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
You make me sound like the father in " East Lynne. "
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
All right, Ollie. Go ahead. Call the Boyds... 3000W... see if their darling Donald has left.
That's right.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings. Neither of them received invitations.
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
You're shouting at me.
It's your play.
That's the Farren house.
But I told her to go with you.
You do that, Edward.
Did you mail then?
Where did you mail them?
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
But, Amy, that was just a story; it wasn't real. That tree's no mailbox.
Certain wishes do.
But this is different. Go on blow,
Can't you tell me later?
Because you didn't ask them? I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
Why didn't you run after them?
And who did the voice belong to?
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Let me be the judge of that.
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty five cents for it, too.
Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
She's there whenever I call her!
Don't you see her?... Right there, under the tree.
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
I have eyes too, and I tell you no one's there. If you deny that, if you insist that this woman you call your friend is in the garden, then I'm afraid I shall have to punish you. Do you understand?
She's upstairs... the lady who lives up there.
Tell me tha real truth. You can see my friend, can't you?
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
Irena. But who are you?
I've wanted a friend.
But where do you come from?
But where is that?
Will you be friend for always?
I shall want you for always.
Not even Daddy... or Mommy?
Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
But you must!
Oh yes they do. Look. One is like a tall princess.
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
That's right!
Of course,
Light shining  in her eyes  Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
Pretend, darling. It's All Soul's Eve. Round about the fire we go... Over the flames we leapt
My dolls. We can pretend.
Oh, but the winter's fun. There's the wind and the snow. You'll like the warm fire upon the hearth, and the long, long nights.
You can open it now, I guess. Lois Huggins says that's proper,
I shall wear it in my hair!
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
It stands so still.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
May I pet the deer?
I want to touch it.
She's dead! I know what it is now when people say somebody died. I know what they mean! And I'm afraid. She's dead; she's dead!
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
But, Amy! Amy... I'm dead.
But why?
A lady threw it to me.
It's a pretty ring.
The ring up to him  What's a mourning ring?
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
Let me take another look at that ring.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
Soon as I finish.
That means I can go alone?
But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Because it can't. It's dead.
It got hit.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard. I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party and me with the cake already in the oven.
She pleaded so to do it
So do I, Mr. Reed.
Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A S S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build up, and if his woman isn't givin'it to'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
Looks like a helluva lot more than a make over. Was there surgery involved?
Don't apologize. It's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.
Yeah that's like a three bagger. Today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that's really hot. So hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses.
No.
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
Oh, on my wrist.
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
How have you been feeling?
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called " The PMS Diet, " which may be helpful.
Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
Mom!
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
Translation: a total geek.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
He's a very talented musician.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
I'd kill for just a little bloated.
Can't you get contacts?
Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
There's a sale. It's such a nice place classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.
Even on sale that stuff's a fortune. I worked all week to pay for a bra.
George bit you?
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
Maybe they have to pee.
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
You are not Frida, we all have a little hair there. I didn't even notice till you showed me. We can bleach that, it's no big deal.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
Why would they exaggerate?
No, did you fuck him?
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
What? Why the hell did he do that?
And then?
At least your PMS is over.
Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.
I wonder if he's married.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
What the hell is the tampon test?
I looked like an Italian man!
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
Hey, Carlton's in town come out with the three of us.
Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast.
You're just saying that.
Oh my god. I've never had that before. I've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said " Hey there beautiful. "
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
I look like fuckin'Chewbacca.
No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
I've been here. What day is it?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Oh no.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
I'm stopping by later. I'm worried about you. Bye.
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
Yeah, I guess. Mark?
DON'T call the police.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
Why the fuck would you do that?
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
Okay, let's say that this is PMS related. You think those male cops are going to understand that? You'll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. We have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves.
Ignore it.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure I don't get how it works.
You're such a good friend.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
" The female cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves. " See I knew you never loved Mark.
She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
What choice do we have?
Fall in love.
I tried to kill myself earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
The werewolf always dies at the end. Didn't you see " American Werewolf in London? "
About Benito.
No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
I wish I only had your problems.
Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
I do development for TV movies.
You said you're starving. Come on, I can't stand a woman who won't eat.
That's great. Highly original.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
My apartment's just such a mess.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
You don't have to pee.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
Uh huh. So pee.
Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it that's what this is all about, right?
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
I'm working on it...
Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in.
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
Script coverage?
Coffee and...
A little.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
No.
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
There's a lot of that going around.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
Oh, it's nothing.
It's stupid.
No, she died when I was twelve.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
Like what?
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date.
Yeah. Maybe.
Goodnight.
What are they for?
My period? No.
Frida, wait. Don't go. We can just sleep. I just want to wake up with you.
I'm sorry I'm on edge today.
Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
What happened?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
Speaking of Mark we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
Is that how you feel?
You didn't say it.
You know, I've never seen your cat.
No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural.
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
Peter I love you too but...
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
I know. The important thing is that it stop.
I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose " eating him " as the method of killing?
You use the word " fucking. " You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex.
No, it was our first date.
No, I have a cat.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
So now being with Frida is lucky? I thought you said she was a flake.
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
You can't believe this bullshit.
I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun.
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days.
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
Madonna's in Penthouse?
Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin'eyes.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
And fifth, you're dating her.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
What kind of animal?
Thanks. Just some pills.
The city. I need to get to the ocean.
Yeah, I  m like that. Senility says the wife. But she sure can  t complain. Heh. The erector set still works good. And this ain  t no fucking rug! G  head. Feel it! All mine!
Spinning backwards?
I know it's his doctor... I need the file on.. Daniel Paul Schreber M. D.
His wife.
No one available.
Well, sir... I don't know exactly.
Shut up! Everybody stay calm...
Really? And how is his state of mind?
That's surprising. He was leaving your office at the time...
I see. One thing  s for sure, he  s ambitious. You  ll be a busy man from now on.
She  s getting better, thanks. She...
Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me...
That was a pretty good escape act at the station. How did you do that?
I don't know who they are.
Don't know that either.
That's right. Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads. No mistake. I just hadn't remembered it that way. Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory. That's not all. Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies. It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event. Then I would turn the lights off. Sit down in a comfortable chair... And study each detail of this subject.
Why, that's ridiculous. You just...
Not that. Anything else.
Is that your idea of a joke? I don't remember... Take my advice, Bumstead. Get off this case. Now.
Which one?
Where does it lead?
No. I mean... that isn  t necessary.
Please...
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it? Is there nothing you remember? Not even a detail? You must try.
Water?
Your name is John White.
Tell me about them...
That's right. I am your doctor.
Anything but, my friend.
You can't go yet. We've got so much to talk about...
So you're telling me the truth this time? Is that it!
Everyone get's one very much like this... But this one's special. It will help you understand, everything...
Why?
How do you know I'm innocent?
I can't do that. It's dangerous. What about my parents? Do you know where I can find them?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Don't say a.
Is this dangerous or anything?
The usual...
It happens. This is where you'll be sleeping.
Oh... Okay.
For a month.
Right and don't embellish.
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony. All you have to say is  thanks for doing this, Ellen. '
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
Share...
You're lint! You're a flea! You're a blip!
I know.
Nightmare...
Don't call the Vice President!
Just don't call him, Alan!
I don't give a shit.
This is mine, Al all mine... I made him. I built him. And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be Vice President of the United States!
Bob, the guy had a stroke!
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Yes and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Soon.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke of course much more serious this time the newly appointed V. P. becomes the Pres...
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
Her?... Oh the First Lady... She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr. I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  the hotel.'She seems to hate him more than ever.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'story...
The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob. He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
Check his kids.
Nobody's got clean kids.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up. Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months. The whole thing is under control.
It's a homeless shelter.
It's gonna be great.'Caring about his wife.'' Spending time on her favorite issue... '
Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
You're kidding.
Three years.
Oh. Fine.
You can't kill a President.
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
What I told him to?
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free. I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
I'll lock him away for good.
Are you threatening me?
Jesus...
Oh yeah... Me, too. You want to get dinner later?
Oh. Okay. I'll catch ya tomorrow then.
They could put you in jail.
And who's gonna find out?
I am the government.
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
Well, yeah. But you gotta start making some choices.
You know priorities. Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed  cause you wanted to get that piano?
Yeah. That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
Well take care.
We're not upset with you, Dave. We think you did a terrific job. Don't we?
Extend them. C'mere for a second.
What happened?
Really? Crazy?
Well, let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital. You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
Now, let's say the whole country. Was in that car. The entire United States of America.
In the car.
What?
Oh.
At a press conference.
That's at a press conference. Otherwise he just puts  em right out there.
Dave...
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Quick. Gimme a quarter.
This is wrong, Alan!
Alan...
And these are a gift from the King of To go.
Ah.
The Fidelity nonsense...
They re not my attack dogs.
I just fired Bob Alexander.
Yeah.
You know. Your first campaign.
My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.
You're not?
On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
Really?
You mean you don't know or like you can't say.
Oh.
You got a gun?
Huh. You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
What's that?
You're kidding.
Oh, sure. Don't worry about it.
Oh... right... You know, ever since the stroke...
You don't change, do you, Bill?
That's not just a works bill you vetoed that would have given these kids homes...... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
You made their funding disappear!
Oh... Yeah.
No.
Oh, I don't think so. Still, you helped a lot of people.
You weren't in the state legislature.
I'm sure they did.'State of Emergency.'' National Security.'You ever hear of the Constitution?
Where are you going?
I never wanted to hurt anybody. In fact... I even thought I was helping.
Thanks.
I'm starving. There's got to be something open around here.
I guess.
Yes.
Yeah. Is that funny?
Well don't get carried away I'm not that good at it.
But you could go to jail for it.
I know. I'm sorry...
That's okay.
You really believe that?
I sure fall for some weird guys.
 Thought I needed a little change. You like it?
I missed...
Oh... I lived with a President. It isn't any fun.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time. That last guy was a joke.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
Oh yeah. Did you take care of later on?
Fabulous.
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever... FOREVER!
Then why did you come here?
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein'borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands'round here. They was leasin'this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o'that. Now this is Dickerson's.... Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o'his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee... and his private army, of course.
Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against'em. We been watchin'you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could.... well, it could be the end of everything.
Curse?
It's a disease. It's a... a bug... a parasite that infects the brain.
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o'Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin'your liver for lunch.
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin'for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much.... traffic.
No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here!
What?
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
There's hundreds of'em. Right where we landed our boat.
Look... I know you have no reason to trust me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin'out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island.
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
What?
I got some fuel comin'out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.
Oh, no. I'm tryin'to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin'in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
What?
A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? How're you gonna leave yourself time to get out?
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of'em... without bein'able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin'you.
Come on!
But... we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to... to...
No. The disease was cut away from me. I will live. I will live.
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
I detest all my sins... because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy... just... punish...
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
No wonder they're so.... hungry.
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
Rhodes, you and I had a roll in the hay together when I first got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which I do not want to, and which I never will repeat! So give up, mister! I'm going home... to that roommate you mentioned.
No, Miss Science. You're the one who needs to do some thinking.
Some of Rhodes'men. At the door.
It's because of me.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
I am not... a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not... I'm not strong that way. I need...
I can work here. Maybe my work can help... help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
MARY!
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave them there. Go help with the rest of the gear.
Let me see your weapon.
What'dya get?
We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
Actually I don't
To fucking Mutt.
You know how many demerits we're talking?
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
They're townies?!
Hell no, I'm not afraid of them just, if we get caught with them, we're dead.
It will? How do you figure?
But why?
Meeks, you're the brain here. What do the dead poets say about somebody like me?
No, I've been calm all my life! If I don't do something, it's gonna kill me.
Yeah.
So?
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point. That's not the point at all!
The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me. Damn it, it's gonna happen! I feel it. She's going to be mine!
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
This is it.
It should, but I found it and now I claim it. carpe cavern, guys. Seize the cave.
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?! Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is? Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?! What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
But I thought
Yes sir.
Isn't he precious?
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body. You're not like that.
No! Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Please! It's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
This is better than sex any day. This is romance!
Your family move into that new house, Mr. Overstreet?
Mr. Dalton, if you think you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again. Others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail. Bend over and grab your shins.
What is this " Dead Potts Society "? I want names.
If I find that there are others, Mr. Dalton, they will be expelled and you will remain enrolled. Stand up.
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
What's his specialty, brown nosing?
You're welcome to join us, Todd.
To put the rout all that was not life. And not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. Pledge Overstreet.
Nuwanda, what is going on?
What happened?
Maybe he'll have some advice. Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
You know,
Chet...
You going out for the Henley Hall play? They're doing " A Midsummer Night's Dream. "
Knox. Oh yes, Knox. I'm glad you called.
I'll be there. The Danburrys. Friday night. Thank you, Chris.
Ginny Danburry's here. Look for her.
I gotta find Chet. Make yourself at home.
Knox, you're crazy.
You can't be in here.
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
But I love you.
Of course just like that. That's how you always know when it's right.
Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
Chet? To a play? Are you kidding?
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Uh huh.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it
What is that?
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Yes sir.
Very good, Mr. ?
Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time. Why does the poet write these lines?
English. Way before your time. It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you. I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom. I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Boys marching. Clapping in unison.
John, the curriculum here is set. It's proven. It works. If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
At these boys'age? Not on your life! Tradition, John. Discipline. Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself.
Again! Louder!
LOUDER!
All right! Very good! There's a barbarian in there after all!
A madman. Perhaps he was. What kind of madman? Don't think! Answer.
Use your imagination! First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
Now there's the poet speaking! Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see. NOW!
A sweaty toothed madman
Excellent! Have him act. Give it rhythm!
From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying, It will cover just your head as you wail and cry and scream!
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Actually, I'd like to talk to you alone.
Why do you do it? I mean, with all this seize the day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall. When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison! I mean, I can see his point. We're not a rich family like Charlie's. But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
Are you kidding? He'd kill me!
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him. You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do. If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Give your father the benefit of the doubt. Talk to him. Let him see who you are.
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
Really? You told your father what you told me? You let him see your passion for acting?
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that. Forget her. Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
She won't even see me, Pitts.
But father, it's not fair.
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please. Until then, you will listen to me.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
Father, I
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?! " My niece is in a play with your son, " Mrs. Marks says. " You must be mistaken, " I say. " My son isn't in a play. " You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play! Is that clear? Is that clear!
Beyond the stream. I think I know.
The god of the cave.
Oh, so you're that Anderson.
I don't.
What?
Todd, if you're gonna make it around here, you've gotta speak up. The meek might inherit the earth but they don't get into Harvard. know what I mean?
But why? Don't you understand what Keating is saying? Don't you want to do something about it?
Put what? Goddamn it, tell me.
What?
God, you really have a problem, don't you? How can it hurt you to read? I mean isn't that what this is all about? Expressing yourself?
What I want to do! Right now. What is really inside of me.
I know that. What's it got to do with you?
So?
And now he will?
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Come on, that's impossible.
Why don't you ask him first? Maybe he'll say yes.
But if he said no before then...
Being in the club means being stirred up by things. You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
No, I want you in. But being in means you gotta do something. Not just say you're in.
Why not? Don't you think you could be?
Er No.
No.
From you?
Neil, you're not gonna...
It is? Happy Birthday. You get anything?
Oh..
I mean, this is one special gift! Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
Follow me then to plainer ground. God, I love this!
Yes, and acting! It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of lives.
Lots of girls. The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
Chicken shit. Where were we?
Put more into it!
That's it! " Follow my voice. We'll try no manhood here. " See you at dinner.
I don't know.
How do we get out of here?
Why don't you want a message sent?
Us... I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
No, it just struck me as odd... I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
The one you came up to ask... are we on schedule?
And no questions asked.
He did... with a crowbar... you know the rules on a broken contract.
We can't... we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
Not an option.
With who?
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
Who asked you to!
I'm not a thief.
I'm their ride.
He's with them.
What are those things?
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
I'm not rich people.
Thank you, I work at it...
Seen a lot of islands?
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes... population of one...
Self sufficient...
Takes one to know one.
Yeah you did...
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
The " come back " kind.
Takes one to know one.
I'm saying they're calling the shots...
We can't just leave them here.
You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this...
... the minute you start your engines... it's goint to kill us, isn't it?
Jet ski... there's one left up there.
And what if I run into one of those things?
You don't take orders very well, do you?
This time, make an exception.
So... If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Shut up, man, just shut the hell up! I gotta think! I gotta think!!
Sure I do... I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
Oh yeah... and that my stich job doesn't make you uglier than you already are... this won't hurt a bit...
No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing?
... Like a house in the suburbs... maybe a couple of kids... some sort of business... be in the bowling league... go to the ball games...
Joey... look at me...
If I don't, I ain't going back to get it... you think we're safe?
Red cross over to blue double blue... is that what it is? A squid?
For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast.
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
And what have you come up with?
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed... and for what? Some chick?
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
Or I could go for a swim... although, I gotta tell you... if I never get in the water again...
What the hell does that mean?
Plans don't change...
Someone's back there.
I'm looking...
She fucked me too.
She fucked me too.
Fucking women, man...
You want'em?
Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
I mean let's get going before
Who's going?
Nick's going?
No women?
Who's full of shit?
I'm telling you, they changed it!
They did too!
It's gotta!
Nick...? Jesus, Nick!
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin'guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
You don't!
I'm tellin'you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin'cock in the front fucking hall?!
She does, Vince! That's what I'm telling you! She does!!!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Here. Hit it here.
I love this car. Some cars sit, you know? This car, a car like this... grows. I mean you never know, with a car like this, where this car has been.
Tell him, Vince.
Nick...
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Sure. Why not.
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick!
You know what Sal's got now?... Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and... that's it.
No, I
I have to go.
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
No. None of that.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
You are his friend.
Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him.
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
Only, good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda
You mean...?
You call me Linda, just like home.
How was huntin'?
Get anything?
Too bad.
Not bad fresh, but they don't keep worth a pig's fart.
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Now he's back.
Oh well! What do you mean Oh well?! The guy is actually... He did it again! That's what he's doing... He... He's reaching in, John, to her! I'll kill him! I'm gonna kill him right now.
Vince!!!
Sit down. Here. Right here. Albert! Vince!
No?
Not so good.
Worse since she talked to him.
Kind of. You didn't know?
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
Oh, Jesus.
Linda, what's the matter?
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking
What?
Okay.
What kind of beer would you like?
Give her Miller's. Miller's High Life.
Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so!
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
But
I made you a sweater. Here... You have to take that off.
Frost.
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk
Nick. It's okay... It's okay. I have to go now.
You're going hunting?
I see you're going hunting.
Hey. Look. There must be something.
I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve. But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do. Where did you play?
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive. La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
Playing?
And then you...
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
Sure. Sure, Sal. We're going home.
That way it sets.
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
You do?
So do I. I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
Fucking A.
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
What do you think about?
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo yo.
Who's a yo yo...? Who do you think's a yo yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
Yeah. When it comes to hunting, that's true.
Fucking A. See that ribbon in the left. That's Quan Son. That fucking guy was at Quan Son!
Pow?
Oh.
Well, where's he from?
Yeah.
Promise! You gotta promise!
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
Yeah... I mean so he knows... He doesn't even know.
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
What are you, hoping?
I thought you might be praying.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
Forget Sal.
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
Forget Sal... Listen to me forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD TOO!
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
Nick... NICK!!! It's the only chance we've got!
No way. No fucking way!
No. No way!
YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY!!!
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
I like it, Nick.
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
Here! This is it!
No.
No.
That's it. No. No way.
You gotta learn, Vince! You come out here... You got no jacket, you got no pants, you got no knife and you got no boots. You think everyone's gonna take care of you! That's what you always think, but this time you're wrong. This time you're on your own!
You know what I think? There's times I think you're a goddamn faggot!... I fixed you up a million times, Merle! I fixed him up a million times! I don't know how many times I fixed him up... and nothin'ever happens... Zilch! Zero!... The trouble with you, Merle, no one knows what you're talking about! " This is this "? What does that mean, " this is this "? I mean is that some faggot bullshit, or is that some faggot bullshit!!! And if it isn't, what the hell is it???
You guys are crazy. You know that? I mean you guys are really nuts.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
Great. That's great.
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
What's that noise?
What's that noise?
Great. Hey. That's great.
John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
What?
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly
We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars.
Did you get one?
You didn't get a deer?
Where?
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
Yeah.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird... Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange...
Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I mean... Great! That's really great!
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
No!
Oh, Jesus! You're kiddin'!
Six or eight. And they go wild?
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
The fuck I did!!!
Up ribbon!
Down ribbon!
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model. I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
No chance. Not their sector. They ain't even into things this big. Our zone boy's performing out of a horror show. Something else. Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood. One Manny Turner. Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
This monster escaped from Cryo Prison this morning.
I want this bastard brought down.
I'd think about it.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting. If you've forgotten, they're called'men'. Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade. I want to know who put you up to it.
Shucks, and I got all dressed up.
Jury found you guilty, not me. I just called it as I saw it. Fuck that. You were brought here for a reason. Doucet's escaped. Re animated for his parole hearing. Killed a lot of people. Most of them cops.
I want to see my wife and kid.
I told you. I'm out of the cops and robbers business. Retired twenty years ago. I've been trained as a bus driver. Got a whole route planned and everything. Even nailed down the lingo'Exact change, please'.
No, but he's going to be by tomorrow. He's aging.'Bout the entire twenty years lost while being frozen in forty eight hours. In that time he'll be an old man. Could be a year, an hour, or all at once. Called NPA Syndrome. Natural Pro gression of Aging. It affects each individual differently. I'm sure it's painful.
Give it to me.
Ah, fuck you, Wade. This is bull shit. You're not going to kill me. You're not going to risk your freedom.
Don't threaten me. I tend to take these things seriously. And get a couple hours sleep. You look like day old shit.
Not anymore.
I heard about today. Good job. I'm all for capital punishment. Why don't you go home and see your family?
What are you talking about?
You were the dirty cop... and I was on to you. You panicked. Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
Forget it. Stick to the program.
I'm thrilled beyond belief.
Tell Doucet that. What was his rehabilitation training?
I don't want any press on this. I've got an election to win day after to morrow.
I've also drafted a letter to families of officers killed in the line of duty. They'll need your signature.
Aces.
You sure? I can help you.
Nobody's looking.
Ooops, I forgot.
Are you a cop?
Well, that's good enough for me.
I'm ready.
Give me a break, Sanchez. It's like riding a bike.
Got it. Ejection seat?
Lean year for role models.
Some things never change.
We don't know that for sure. We'll have to wait until they move.
When you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?
Give me a break. I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
How then?
I also PVC'd you. Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs. Four honor medals...
It doesn't make sense. Who would want to do that to you?
Yeah. Least I think so. Twenty six years this March.
Good night, Wade.
Hey, I'm eating.
You want to be a good detective?
Then find me some cigarettes.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize. Crime's a science. Everything's analyzed.
You're just afraid to use this. You have technophobia, Wade. That's what you got.
You're not pregnant, are you?
Wallet, cash, I. D...
How do I look?
You treat her nice.
Your girl. Being a cop will be rough on her.
Not yet.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
What is it? Your legs? Hands?
You be careful.
You startin'a fan club or some thin'?
You never want to find out.
But he was such a good cop.
Well I've got news for you. This dirty cop was the only cop who could bag Doucet.
Seat's too high.
William Simpson. I like Willy.
Haven't seen you around. Where have you been all my life, handsome?
You could always take it off.
Oh Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady. Get some wine for the Squire, Belle.
Belle
You're lying.
You know that you're in my house.
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back not that way.
All right, Daniel. Jump in.
No but I can hardly wait Mister tell me, will there really be a man that eats fire?
And two unpara unparalleled Cir cass ian beauties? What is that?
' N Daniel Webster will be there.
I think I'd like to begin with the fire eater
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
It does hurt! And don't you do it again.
Golly I'd like to see all your horses!
What's that, sir?
Anybody can see that.
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
Daniel!... I've stood just about as much as I can bear!
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
But I like the new one better.
Not me!
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Well here's how it is... Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about that new sort of organization grange they call it. What you think about it?
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
Don't I?... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Thanks, Jabez I really wouldn't need very much... if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for spring planting...
Are you one of old Stevens'customers too?
Yes, it's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer!
Black Dan'l?
What Grange?
We'll be mighty glad to have you with us.
She couldn't be gone!
Belle
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment
In gold.
You know some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air. Like that!
Doesn't satisfy, eh? Well that's too bad....
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Where's everybody?
Almost seven. No no, he's not seven yet I am sure
Afraid... of what?
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried that's all.
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
All right so it's buried with you!
Huh? What's that? Well what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Stevens what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it you know something about me!
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county. You just go about it the wrong way so many men do. Hard work well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky but once you're lucky you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
A clever man like yourself he can find money anywhere. Money to pay his bills money for his wife and his children money to be a rich man. All he needs is a friend to point it out to him. Like that!
Yes, why shouldn't it?
What does it mean here about my soul?
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot what is the date?
1840. Well, that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847.
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
Oh, certainly. I shan't even come to the christening it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste. But I may send a friend of mine just for old sake's sake. Yes, I might do that.
Just a minute, neighbor Stone. I promised you money and all that money can buy. I don't recall any other obligations. But let's look at the contract.
He was
My time isn't up yet.
What a headstrong fellow! Well I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone You know I'm a good natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security I might
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of You see there is that promising little fellow, your son...
Come, come, Mr. Stone, you are a little upset. It's not fair to bargain with you now. I'll give you until midnight, Mr. Stone, but not one minute more. Ah, then you'll come with me indeed.
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
That is highly irrelevant to this case, Your Honor.
You know darn well it is.
Not at all, lad not at all. For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.
Well I'll be if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
What what's on your mind?
Contracts? Yes, they have contracts with me lots of'em but but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
No you haven't time You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
Oh, come, man, come. Just because you've sold your soul to the devil that needn't make you a teetotaler.
I know that was mighty queer Medford knew it the minute I tasted it. But it takes more than that to down Daniel Webster.
Worst I had in years ahem starting a spring cold, I guess er don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
You really think so?
Why of course
Dan'l Webster?
Yes.
The only one you missed is the President.
Yes siree that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: " Look, folks here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor. " Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
Oh yes I am want to bet?
How much?
Shake!
All right only he needn't dirty my pants!
You're right, Mary.
Yep.
That's what we said.
It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers Oh, glory where's my pants?
If it would only move old Miser Stevens We've still got to pay him.
Your butter money?
Mary it's gone.
Yes I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Mary, I'm a farmer always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh how's it all going to end?
I will, Mary always thought a man could be stronger alone seems I've been wrong about that.
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on... It's a lovely calf.
Mary how do you feel?
Mary what would you do?
Mary look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
I'd love to.
Worried!
You'll never change will you?
Don't take cold, Jabez. Come it's warm in here.
Thanks, Mary.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
I'm serious.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds when the Squire and his wife
Well that's the last time we'll have servants to do it.
And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
Nothing, Jabez just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes. Shh, little Daniel sleep sleep
You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.
My fault?... Oh, Jabez all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
But Jabez, I never said that!
Well I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do remember?
What's the matter with'em? Why don't they come?
Mary! Come back...
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a reading the holy word!
Now, Jabez Stone as for what you're calling hard luck well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
Yes and you figgered right, consarn it!
Helps sometimes to say it.
Well... make him keep quiet.
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell. Don't seem right, somehow!
Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance.
I feel fidgety, Ma not right at all.
Me a son.
Do you really think that?
I know, Ma, but Suppose a man got his money in bad ways
A man can always change things, Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters.
What's that you say, Son?
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Golly, Ma Consarn that music! Shouldn't a had the harvest festival tonight.
Gone with Daniel Webster to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
The law is the law. Good bye, Mary.
And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
Belle, give the Sheriff a cup of rum.
Coming, Ma.
What mountain?
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone I'm worried about you, that's all.
What's that?
Ah, fiddlesticks you are old enough to know what you are doing.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Of course. And you tell your father for me we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
Well she hardly ever comes here she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes I'm all on my own sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely Do you mind if I indulge?
No, you wouldn't You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke or fire But now let's talk about your affairs.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman like nibbling around the edge But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary I've been called names myself.
Mary you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us the shadows and the evil but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson and other things.
And now come on, Mary. I want to show you the all fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right here in Marshfield of course!
Mr. Webster you will help him?
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
I'll be there, too!
Scratch will do for the evening. May I join you?
Me?
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy.
Cup for cup!
There, Mr. Webster. All open and above board and in due and legal form.
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England?'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
You mean a jury trial?
Very well. You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury
The quick or the dead! You have said it. May the best man win, Mr. Webster!
That isn't it. It's... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch... the loneliness!
I want someone to talk to...
No, no... I want to talk to men... to people in Cross Corners... to my neighbors...
I can't be honest with them.
That's okay. This is my first time riding in one.
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
Hey, I'm sorry. When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
So, you divorced of what?
Closer to Japan. You're fast.
' Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
The police...?
John? Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up... what does he think he's doing?
His'job'is 3000 miles away. Without him, they might let us go... at least we have a chance...
What are you going to do?
I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
John, how can you say that, after all these years? John? John?
You're amazing. You figured this all out already?
I must have missed 60 Minutes. What are you saying?
I don't want neutral... I want dead
Who said we were terrorists?
Just the fly in the ointment, Hans. The monkey in the wrench, the pain in the ass
I'm afraid not. But you have me at a loss you know my name, but who are you? Just another American who saw too many movies as a child. Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne... Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
New York...
Sounds better than nothing.
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
Yeah. Like you did with Takagi.
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
' Yippe ki yea, mother fucker'? Now you are fucked.
If out plan works... the FBI will get rid of it for us.
You did. You murdered by Boss. Now... They're looking to me. Personally I'd pass on the jab. I don't enjoy being this close to you.
No. But I'll have a sofa brought out to you. Good enough?
Yes, you're right. It will be done.
That's okay...... I have an eye on his private bathroom.
Ramona... no, Pomona, that's it.
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
Didn't we have this same conversation in July? Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here I had to take it
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
You want to know my idea of a marriage? It's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots console each other when there's a down... and when there's an up, well, hell, a little Goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn't be too bad. I needed that, John. I deserved that.
Yeah. How'd you know?
So I've heard.
I'm fine. You throw quite a party. I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
Uh, what do I call you?
They're all yours, Al. Good luck.
I said we'll talk later, Roy. If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors. One spotters say you got two with that blast.
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours? That doesn't even make any sense
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
They boys'll be glad. We got a pool going on you.
Hey, you couldn't know.
Then this won't matter. LAPD's not calling the shots anymore.
I hope so. But that's up to the guy upstairs. Upstairs...... Hans, you bastard... what were you doing?
Stand by, Powell. I gotta check something out.
I'm serious. Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero.
The terrorists? Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
We don't exactly know, Sir. He won't give us him name. He appears to be the man who called in the report... he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
I don't think so, Sir. In fact... I think he's a cop. Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
A hunch. Things he said. Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID
Going in... are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there for all we know
What about the body that fell out of the window?
Give me that. Now, listen to me, mister, I don't know what you think you're doing, but demolishing a building doesn't fall under the definition of'help'! There's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass
Maybe. And maybe they'd at least be talking to us! Now tell your'partner'to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
Anytime you want to go home, Sergeant... consider yourself dismissed.
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it. They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to and I say,'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors. '
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors. Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you. I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
I blame myself, Sonny. I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin'at the kids like a madman, believe me. And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there fulla one year old kids. It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there,'You pig, get on the fuckin'ride!'Well, everything fell outta me my heart, my liver fell to the floor you name it! Yellin'at me in front of all those people. Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never. I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
See? You're screaming with the language and all! A person can't communicate with you. You become a stranger in your own home...
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat. Like I can't stand you being a bank robber. I guess that's what love is huh, Sonny?
Jesus what I'm afraid I'm gonna get shot or whatever. You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
Listen, it's late already when I realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and Sal. I couldn't get a baby sitter.
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Take the subway. We need the car. Hey, gimme the keys the keys!
It looks like a whole roast.
Yeah. A lot of guns.
Oh, yeah, I will...
How are you doing?
Yeah. You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Well.... huh...
Oh... huh... how you feeling?
Well, you know... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
Yeah...
So... that sure is something.
Fine, thank you. I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know. Boy... I'm dying.
What are you talking about?
Now don't give me that deep shit now. Don't start with that shit.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that. Well, I don't know what to say, Leon. When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit. I mean, what am I supposed to say?
I told you. That I got a lot of pressures. You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money! I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
All right. I know you didn't ask me. You didn't ask me but I did it.
I did it on my own. I did this all on my own. I ain't laying it on anybody. Nothing on anybody. I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know. I am squaring away my accounts with life. Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow. Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too! I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know? That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
I'm getting out of here, man. I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up. I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway. So fuck it! But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon. If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come. You're free to do what you want.
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing. And we're gonna go, man!
That's it.
I know!
Who the fuck knows? I think we're gonna go... we worked it out to Algeria. So, I don't know. So I'll go to Algeria.
Huh... I don't know. They got Howard Johnson's there. I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
I know that. I'm warped... I'm warped!
What am I supposed to do?
Denmark? Sweden?
Sal wanted to go to Wyoming. I told him it wasn't a country. We gotta get outta the country! To hell with a guy who doesn't know where Wyoming is. Okay. Can you imagine what kind of a shape I'm in?
Oh... wow! Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
Would you do something for me? Please?
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing. They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
I gotta listen to it if they think...
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
Yeah.
I don't have a choice.
No! They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Look... don't throw that on me.
Yeah... I knew it. But, what choice do I have? I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
They won't talk to you.
Yeah... yeah!
Yeah... huh, thank you. I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people. They're really trying to help me.
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Yeah... yeah.
It's my only chance!
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
You said a mouthful... sweetheart!
Well, you got to get hold of yourself. You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
He's got eight people in there with him. He's got this kid with him... they're gonna shoot the people.
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
You try calling the police?
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
He's makin'threats in there.
What kind of things, Leon?
He needed money? For the operation for you?
Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory. You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
You think it over, Leon.
Who's this?
... But you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time... You got it? Okay?
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
You alone, or you got confederates?
How many you got in there?
Sal? What's that for? Salvatore?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin'to call you.
Sonny boy, one word?
Listen, Sonny... can I call you Sonny for short?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there. I want to come over there, without a gun... and you can frisk me. So you can see you can trust me. So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
You frisk me.
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny. I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me. Some sight... right?
How about letting the people out of the bank. Why put them in this position?
Okay, give us the women.
You're all one way! I'm bein'reasonable with you; give me somethin'... Give me one of them, anyway... Just one...
You want me to give up, huh? Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me one move and Sal gives it to them. Boom boom. How do I know you won't jump me?
Well, armed, then. Nobody's been hurt. Release the hostages, nobody is gonna worry over kidnapping charges, the worst you're gonna get is five years you can be out in a year.
Calm down, you're not...
Okay, what do you give me?
The girl hostages.
I'll see what they'll do.
You tryin'to fuck me?
So, what were they doin'? You're tellin'me you had nothin'to do with that back there?
Bullshit... I don't walk to talk to you...
Yeah...
You're full of shit...
Well, what were you doin'back there?
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here...
Don't fuck with me...
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body...
All right... I got some hungry people in there... I want to get some pizza... some stuff like that...
Cokes, seven ups... also some aspirin...
Okay...
I want to talk to him.
He's totally unstable. He'll make a mistake.
Eugene, at 3: 07, this became Federal. Why don't I take it over now?
Okay, don't worry about it. Stick it in the bag...
My side, shit!
You and me are checking the other ways in and out.
To what... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
Ah, I know! You're being very cooperative. I got no complaint against you whatever; you got bank insurance?
What if I take you with me?
They'll shoot you; the fucking cops'll shoot you... they don't give a damn. In spite of that bank insurance. You see what they did in Attica, they shot everybody, the hostages, prisoners, cops, guards, forty two people they killed, the innocent with the guilty.
Wait a minute... I've been looking at this all wrong... Let's look at it the other way...

I'm not going. I'm okay.
You tell me. Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
Oh, Jesus! You want to be a martyr or a hero or what?
They're like any others but they're special to me. You got kids? You told me; you got two.
You like me?
No you don't.
You know... I like you people... I really do.
You know I had a job once. I used to work in a bank. I had been training... I used to have a boss... Mr. Don Frio... he wore a toupee... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job...
Yeah.
I don't think so.
Are you a lawyer?
I want to dictate my will. I need a notary?
Listen, I owe a couple hundred dollars! I don't wanta leave owing anybody anything! A clean slate, a new leaf...
Yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket.
Yeah. Well, you're okay?
Okay.
It's okay.  Regards to the family, Sam. 
Hey. It's raining.
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Did you always call him Junior.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
I used to, but I stopped.
Because I don't want cancer.
You shouldn't start now.
Go ahead. Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record. You oughta take care of your body.
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
You're really pure, you know? You got a perfect record. You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
What are you crying for? Jesus Christ. It's not your fault there's no money...
... The bodies out the door.
But do you mean it?
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out. Okay?
I want him to think that.
We won't have to.
Alive.
All right... let's go.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal...
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive... get'em to drop the kidnapping charges...

We'd kill ourselves.
We're not there yet.
Wyoming... That's not out of the country that's in the United States... Look, I'll be back.
I never been up in a plane before.
Look, I talked to him and it's not going to be a helicopter they can't land on top of the roof so they're comin'with a big... limousine bus and they'll take us to the airport and they're gonna get a jet... so things are rollin'... they're movin'... I also ordered some food... I got some pizzas for us, all right? I got some things to drink I got sodas... I even asked them for aspirins... I'm doin'what I can... now I gotta pay for the pizza... where are the marked bills?
That's all they're interested in it's a freak show to them. I can't control it, Sal let'em say what they want. Forget it. It don't matter.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
All right.
Oh, Jesus! Hey. How about food? I forgot to ask to have food on board.
Aw, Jesus... you been doin'us favors all night!
Bullshit!
At the airport. We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
I want to talk to Leon.
I have to see.
Nothin'personal, huh? The man that kills me, I want him to do it because he hates my guts. Not because it's a job. Okay, let's go... but you gotta walk in backwards.
Gimme the black guy...
Open this up!
It's not a joke. I got this terrible fear of being locked in...
Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom come on...
... Just give me time to think...
Those bastards they poisoned the pizza! Sal you didn't eat any pizza!?
Mom I got it all worked out; it's over. The best thing is you go home. Watch it on TV.
You did what? Who did you talk to? What for?
Oh my God, mother!
Don't talk to them anymore. Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria I'll write you from there.
We can't stay here.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again...
Mom. Mom. There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
She doesn't have anything to do with it! You understand that? Mother? This is me!
Not now, Mom, please.
I can't, Mom. If I come out Sal will kill them.
What the hell for? Twenty five years in the pen?
Maybe! Aw Christ, what dreams you live on! Maybe what?
Did Pop come down?
He's right. You shoulda done what he did. Go home. Don't talk to the FBI anymore.

Wake up? Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Good! Leave me alone when I'm sleeping. I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
Do me a favor. Go to work.
Sal's gonna be mad.
I think no such a thing. Sal pays you, you should work.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all. I'm carrying you as it is.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
I didn't stutter. Take care of your responsibilities. Y'know exactly what I'm talking about.
I'm going with you.
I'll see ya there.
No, you're tripping. Don't come in Sal's. Alright, read my lips.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
Nice!
Innocent!
You should see the way he looks at you. All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
I might be, but you're not welcome here.
Oh, it doesn't, huh! You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
... peanuts.
I truly hope so. I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Can you pay me now?
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
I would like to get paid now.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
C'mon, Sal.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
We both do.
Do we now?
You don't know shit about shit.
Keep it.

Shit! I forgot.
I just forgot.
No! No! You won't come back either.
How long then?
That's out. No! It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
You a blue moon fool.
What else?
Trust you? Because of trusting you we have a son. Remember your son?
Why you gotta curse?
No rawness.
Lie down, please.
Later for you.
What?
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something. You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Be a man.
You're to the curb. You better step off. Get a life.
You get paid to do what we say.
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk. What do we pay Mookie for? He don't even work. I work harder than him and I'm your own son.

Mookie's OK.
Stop busting my balls. I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
How do you know this?
You really think so?
So what do you want me to do?
And that's exactly what I'm talkin'' bout.
Can you do better? C'mere.
Twenty minutes. How come you niggers are so stupid?
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Then we could try something else.
I'm sick of niggers, it's a bad neighborhood. I don't like being around them, they're animals.
So what if this is a Black neighborhood, so what if we're a minority. I've never had no trouble with dese people, don't want none either, so don't start none. This is America. Sal's Famous Pizzeria is here for good. You think you know it all? Well, you don't. I'm your father, you better remember that.
I have five kids at home, I know how it works. I'm just not " it ". Okay guys? Two fifty.
Excuse me.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
You're the kid who was home schooled.
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four color ink pens at the student store.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine. I'm Jessica Matthews.
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
You did?
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re, re... special
You and Lloyd chose the class!?
O'clock?
Gotcha.
Would you like something to drink?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years.
Just down the hall.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
What?
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
No, that's not it. Anyway LLOYD Christmas.
I haven't seen you around here before.
Home school? What's that?
Me too!
No, it's a treasure map.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
What?
No no no no no.
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
Me too!
Yeah, he's aces. Thanks, Turk!
Wow.
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
Oh, of course.
Just a guy I hang out with.
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says " yo ho ho " has a peg leg...
Yeah, go cart accident.
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank. Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
Your mom made a move on me.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
I will stop this car right now.
You take that back!
Where did you learn that word?
Kids.
No.
I didn't know that.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
A. Slushee. Don't tell me. Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
... cause you said...
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
How do you know it's for us?
Who's your partner?
Well... Uh... maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could... perhaps... maybe... uh... partner up?
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get " some ".
You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
Sure I do. On one condition.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
Alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate.
I kinda screwed things up.
I don't think so.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
Good thanks Lloyd! I'll meet you downstairs, I gotta find some clothes.
I bet you want your head scratched.
But
You're right. Hey, thanks for the jet pack. Your fantasies are so much cooler than mine. Bye Mom.
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
Captain Rob came back?
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin'one.
The answer is George Jefferson.
Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?
A turd.
Hello, he only invented money!
You certainly did.
Sorry, no further questions.
Are, too.
Hey, let's go spy on them.
Well, I'm listening now.
But my mom gave me the map.
I made the polar bear pants.
I... found that rock.
Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
And like she said, do it before the parade.
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
You're a great teacher, Lloyd.
Well, that's too bad, this is his day.
I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget.
Okay. Which one do you want?
What?
Well, what should we do?
I know.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
And, Ching Chong, you're not a Special Needs kid. You're just a foreign exchange student.
Oh no, I know that class isn't for me. But I'm happy for you guys.
Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up.
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
That's it. I'm done.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find what I was looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can't know we were here.
HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
You really are a pirate.
So I'm an " arrrrrs hole ", eh Captain Rob?
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
I reckon so.
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
Well you know Detective, he's expecting'Moffit'to be someone who has... certain... well...
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!
This is my son, Paul.
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Yes.
Play out your little comedy while you can off worlders...

Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
Not sorry enough.
Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Let him stand free!
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Death may be the result.... Are you sure?
As the legend says.
Say it not lightly... Do you know its meaning?
What does she fear? What about my Father?
The South Polar regions... the forbidden area. We must make it to that rock...
Is he....?
He knows.
I know the secret. The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm.
He's hiding something.
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
That it is. He shall know your ways as if born to them.
Always?
Why do they come?
We call that one Muad'dib.
You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us.... We welcome you.
Did they try and fail?
I'd know the difference.
We have our new army. Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
Oh, tract housing, huh? I guess I shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank. What a dump. Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy shower. I still don't know where to hang the towels!
Uh, Greetings. I am the Count...
Ah, cheer up! Don't lose heart over what happened tonight. I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success!
I can't believe this! I sleep in coffins!
YES! My father ran a mortuary it's an old habit!
No. I don't work here.
Ha!
Really?
I thought it was great. You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.
Ah, you gotta be jokin'! A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of'em lined up.
They were mythic. They had a poetry to them. And you know what else? The women prefer the traditional monsters.
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them. Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth. The blood. The blood is horror.
Take my word for it. You want to " score " with a young lady, you take her to see " Dracula. "
Certainly. But now the children of the night are calling me.
You must be double jointed, and you must be Hungarian. Vampira, look at me! Stare into my eyes.
No thank you, Eddie. I'll be alright.
Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde! Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde! I'm looking forward to this production.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Yeah. You pull the strings " Pull the strings "... hey, that's pretty good!
Of course! Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there. Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment
Huh?! Oh yeah, of course.
Eh, forget it. What else is big? Teenagers! Jailbait pics! Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks
Uh, a cop. NO! You play the father. He's angry! He doesn't like seeing his son no he doesn't like seeing his daughter behave this way!
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we know the audience will want to see. Mmm. What was your biggest hit?
Of course!
We can't. Those sons a bitches control the rights.
No! Doctor Acula! You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor! Not a count.
I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!
Let me take you to the hospital.
I don't know how to make goulash.
Don't worry. I'll do something.
" It is my home. "
" Beg to differ. This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates "
Forget about it. We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again.
We didn't make a dime.
You're shooting " Bride Of The Atom. " Scene 85.
Okay. Then you'll be sitting on the left.
" Dear, you're lovely. " " Strap her to the table. "
But was it a bad decision? At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
Yeah, I did.
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag. I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Correct. So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback. Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
Out there?! What happened to the stream?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Fuck you! You come out here. Hey, toss me that J. D.
After I did " Dracula, " the studio offered me " Frankenstein "! But I turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough. It was too degrading for a big star like me.
Alright! Let's put it on film. CAMERA! SOUND!
No. Seriously. I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me. A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Jesus Christ, what an evening. What happened?
Don't you have any savings?
Bela, I'm on your side. C'mon, give me the gun... If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink. What are you drinking?
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be all right.
Bela, they're parasites! They just want to exploit you.
No, you look good. And the tests came back fine. C'mon...
Oh. So what is the scene about?
Perfect.
I envied him. Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
I know none of my wives would've.
No problem. I know it by heart...
Mexico! And guess what I'm going to do there?!
WRONG! I'm getting my first series of hormone shots! And once those babies kick in, they're gonna remove my organs, and MAKE ME A WOMAN!
Ssh! He's so big! He's a monster! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie?
If you say so.
You can't sit! You gotta walk around, with good posture. You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll never invest in our movie.
NO! It has to be UNDERWATER!
Edward Wood, Sir.
H how'd you know?!
I don't understand.
Eddie, we're in show biz! It's all about razzle dazzle. Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything.
My pleasure. I'm always happy to assist in a little larceny.
Will he be okay?
No. They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
The ghost can be barefoot. Give me your shoes!
Orson Welles was 26 when he made " Citizen Kane. " I'm already 30!
I know... But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it's gonna get...
Huh?! Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something better happened!
Yeah! I met a movie star! Somebody really big!
No! A horror movie star!
Close! The other one!
Oh, the hell with you. I met BELA LUGOSI!
It's a shame. He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
Jesus Christ! And you never told me?
What, by putting it in a fuckin'script, for everyone to see?! What kind of sick mind would operate like that?
Oh! You got nerve, buddy.
It takes me comfortable.
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Who cares?! We're on a ROLL! These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
But you do! And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts. And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!
Exactly.
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going... But of course I can't I made the worst movie of all time.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Don't get angry at me. Maybe you just need a day job.
All I know is, ever since " Glen Or Glenda, " all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
I'm sorry! What did you want me to say?
But there's plenty of other parts.
The secretary. Or the file clerk.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry? I blew it! I thought she was rich.
I didn't dump you! Get it through your skull I just recast the part!
I'm going to my mother's.
That's right...
None. But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Hey, the movie's getting made. That's the main thing.
But what's our relationship? Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Did you really mean those things you said..?
Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie. Now that it's done, so am I.
Yes. Hollywood is oh so exciting.
For this one, we need  60, 000.
Oh, of course!! There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
Yeah. Exactly!
Yeah. Well I need the other sixty thousand.
The other sixty thousand you said you'd give me.
Yeah? Well now he's a junkie. He don't deserve to work.
He's so great, you hire him.
Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord. Could you please open up?
I'm real sorry. My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one.
I'm interested in the picture business. My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Oh! Our church has the money for one film. We just don't have it for all twelve...
Absolutely! You see this script..?
From outer space! It's science fiction. Very big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films! And pay my back rent from the profits.
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular but don't the big hits always have big stars?
Lugosi??! Didn't be pass on?
It's plenty! It's the acorn that will grow a great oak. I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as " Bela Lugosi's Final Film "
I like to think so.
People won't notice. Filmmaking isn't about picky details it's about the big picture.
We are gonna finish this film just the way I want it! Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!
Tor. Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
I think you're quite handsome.
Nah, that doesn't matter! It's a visual medium.
Hopefully, very soon. I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
No. She tink Lobo is waste of my time. Lobo don't talk.
Bela, he talk. Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me I'm da happiest guy I know!
Forget her! Move on. A good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish.
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed. It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn " Variety " printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie! I've already pre  sold Alabama and Oklahoma. Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff. So we'll just make it without that she male. We'll fictitionalize it.
Hmm. There's five hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of " special qualifications. "
No, no, not at all! I love women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Nah, I'm all man. I even fought in WW2.'Course, I was wearing ladies'undergarments under my uniform.
Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was terrified of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.
No. Better than tits a star!
Yeah. Crap with a star.
Fine, maybe you're right. But it doesn't friggin'matter. I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about.
Isn't he dead?
OUR picture?
Yeah! Five pages right before it ends! The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
And what's with this new title?! My poster says " I CHANGED MY SEX "!
Then how's it gonna get in the picture?!
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do? Make it seven reels long. I've got contracts with my exhibitors. If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
They'll notice. Look, why don't you let me take over from here? I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
Good. And one more thing. I think your " Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood " credit is a bad idea.
And you did a bang up job, too. But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag. Trust me. It's a career killer.
Because I can't sell it to save my life! You made a goddamn feathered fish. Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick? Nobody knows! I'm beggin'people to book it.
Screw you, Wood! I even sunk more money into different titles: " Transvestite " " He Or She? " " I Led Two Lives "... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
" Your movie "?! I wish it was your movie! I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb. If I ever see you again, I'll kill you!!!
I got married last night.
The marriage already ended.
How long's he been here?
You look beat.
He's better. Thank you for asking. How's your friend?
They're very nice. Let me get my coat.
Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners.
" Dracula. "
A few years ago, I actually saw him do " Dracula " live. I thought he was much scarier in person.
I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road.
Oh. Okay.
I might as well be. I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see. I blew it. All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
I was a fuckin'HACK! I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives... I let Bela down...
The left. It's more natural. Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb. What would that be made of?
No. They're beyond that! They're smarter than the humans. What's more advanced?
No, BIGGER! What's the biggest energy??
Yes! BINGO! Solar energy! Oh that's gonna seem so scientific. This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film. No compromises.
Yeah... I should give her a call.
My chiropractor!
C'mon! Let's just go.
Huh?!
But it's pouring. And the car top is stuck!
You don't know me, but my name is Ed Wood. I'm a film producer. I'm currently in production on a science fiction piece, with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson. And I saw you here, and I thought: Kismet!
You want me to show it on my TV program? Well I got nothing to do with that. You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven
Look buddy, I'm a big star. I've got real offers from real studios. I don't need to blow some dentist for a part. So forget it!
It's the same film. But the distributor wanted a punchier title. C'mon! It's gonna be a big event we're going all out! Bela, Tor, and Cris are coming. You'll have fun!
I know what that's like. Anyway, I brought a copy of the script. You would play the " Ghoul's Wife. "
Exactly. Hey, how'bout this what if I don't have any lines? I'll do the part mute!
LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
I suppose. It's very expensive.
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
Ah, c'mon! Nobody does all that.
Wow.
What if I'm vomiting?
I guess I don't it's all in the contract. There's this million page contract
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
At the point I don't Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die. You had a busy night last night.
Look at your face. I had a car that color.
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
They celebrated the common person.
No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.
Well, now I will. He was a crazy mean, son of a bitch.
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Where is she? Is she all right?
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
What?!
Oh, Al... This is just...
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
Okay, I'm nuts.
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's... They know what they're doing.
So?
You know what would be great?
If Ray would steal this girl from Ed. That would be great.
You know it.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady cams following you.
I want you to take this.
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
I do.
Good idea. Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes?
Uh huh?
Sure.
Yeah?!
Stand back I'm about to do my Happy Dance.
Great line.
Ed, do you want my advice?
Leave her be.
Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth.
Ed
Ed
Yeah? Well I'm not starting now.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed TV is an over inflated balloon. Get it off before it explodes all over us.
You said that.
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says " If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life. " And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Your brother's here.
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
What?
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby... Jessica!
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
So he killed himself.
Are the TV people with you?
Send him away.
No.
No. It's a mess.
Hey, he cheated on her.
I don't want to do you know where he is?
No! And that girl has a name.
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married after Dad left.
I mean, that worked out.
Both.
I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television!
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
She could've been a nurse.
She had white shoes.
What's the difference?
Who?
What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...
I'm at the hospital.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
St. Joseph's.
Who?
So you had sex with him?
To you? In front of him? With the...
Oh my god! On TV!
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
I'm a tramp Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
I'm a whore! Your bathrooms are filthy!
No, I understand. That's where is she, is she all right?
What is she, at work?
Well, when will she be back?
She left. She moved. She got Fed Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
She wouldn't tell me.
Our what?
I can imagine. You said you wanted nothing to do with this. You swore to me. " Don't come near me. Don't bring this into my life... "
He's just... trying a little too hard
I can't do that to him. He's pushing a little too hard but... I just can't do that to him.
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
I batted!
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called " Get your shit together before it's too late. "
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Why do it?
Cream rinse?
So?
Dynamite is dangerous.
No, no, I as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, " Boy Shari looks beautiful. " I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it.
Ha!
I've got news for you I never intended to marry him.
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Leave. Go.
Go!
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
Oh God, this is so weird.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
It's quite an honor. Will you come with me?
Saturday, I think we should
He could give me some oxygen.
So? What do they think we're not kids
Shari, I really like you...
... if this...... weren't here...?
So...?
Everybody hates me!
Look at this.
A poll. " Is Shari Good Enough for Ed? " Seventy one per cent said " no. " They hate me!
Twenty nine.
There's a list.
Ed?
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
I'm sorry.
Where?
Okay.
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself " How do they find me " she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
Oh that was... no, I... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu it's too complicated. I Besides...
Well, yeah, everybody's someone. But I mean someone they want to be. I mean let's face it, I'm working in the video store, no one's coming in saying " oh, I wish I was that guy. 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes. " At least for a month I'm not just a guy with a name tag. I'm famous.
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm glad you asked. The contest is who can dig up legally, of course I'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV.
I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll... trust me, this is my business.
Show business.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama!... Bedwetter!
I'm making a tape.
Look there's a million ways to humiliate yourself I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
Why do you do that?
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say " Let me ask you something? " Why don't you just ask me?
I'm doing all right.
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot. Hi.
Yeah.
That's our sister. She's got a new boyfriend.
Marcia's living with a singer?
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Richie! She spent six months dating a criminal
" Quick pull off the highway " is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.
While I'm gone, tell them about our cousin Lenny who's gay. We knew from when he was five.
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Yeah...
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
You brought the girl!
If I go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too.
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
Look, we gotta talk.
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
You know what your problem is?
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault.
Hi, Shari.
Who's
I was in jail.
No. Two times.
Check forging.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
I need help. How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
The pirate ship.
No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.
Hm?
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And... We'11 make a night of it... okay?
What is? Oh, dinner!
Mm.
Ohh... do you own a cat?
How?
What does that have to do with...?
By the X.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
By the X. That's were two lines cross forming an X.
Tu
El / ella
She's incredible. Everything just gets soaked.
In love?
But you haven't written your novel.
Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend. What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay? I know what
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
Everything's fine. Just, you know, school.
He likes it.
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
Do it!
You guys have fun?
Well, Sherry's great. But she can be a little much sometimes.
What?
You're going to Catholic school next year. You're going to Sacred Heart. Maybe they'll straighten you out!
Fine. So do your count. Start with president, and I'll be right back.
All right. I'll be back
You're kidding, right?
Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.
I think we've got a problem.
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
You know what they say about the early bird.
Tracy.
Oh. There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
Here they are.
Could you approve them now? I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
NO, that's fine
Okay, fine. Sure
Hell, you know, Coca Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Are you sure all her signatures are real? It's not easy to get all those signatures.
A travesty. Huh. That's interesting, because I think you did it.
I was. So? Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6: 30.
I don't. I just know they were there when I left. I'm giving you helpful information is all. You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
Well, I don't know. It could have been anybody. There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard. You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn outs. Or Doug Schenken what about him? Or what about Tammy Metzier? Her whole thing is being anti this and anti that.
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake. I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences. You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact but maybe one day you'll understand.
I agree. But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
Oh. New cars. I see. Well, you came to the right place
Huh. Right. College. Wow. Where are you going? Where'd you get into?
Good for you. Good for you
Plenty of pep, too.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
Why are you doing this?
Coming to see me. Are you trying to.. humiliate me?
I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
I hope so
Yeah... whatever. All I know is she's a troublemaker. She's on my list.
Even tried you at home. We've got a situation here.
Okay. But is this about the posters?
Okay. Because I know who did it. So.. I'll just be outside.
What is it. Tammy?
Looks at her skeptically doesn't say a word.
And when did you do it?
Exactly when?
And how did you get in the school?
Which door?
I don't believe you.
More this way.
You sure?
Points at the motel.
All his life. He's tried everything.
Yep.
Right now?
Three twenty five.
Yeah. I'm here.
Don't say that. You know it's not true.
We made a mistake. Let's not make it worse.
I was lonely. You took advantage
I know. I understand disappointment. I really do.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity. I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Let me give you a clue. You're a born leader. You're one of the most popular students at Millard. You're honest and straightforward. You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside. The other kids look up to you. What does that spell?
And she's super nice
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
No, wait apples. Apples.
Exactly. So what do you say? Maybe it's time to give a little something back.
Oh, okay. Yeah, sorry.
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
If you say so.
What...?
People can see this.
These are private these are for us.
But other people can see them too.
Well, I do.
I mean at you.
I don't know. You're her brother you should know.
Oh, no, hey. Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Thought what?
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
Okay, Mr. Popular. You're on.
Hell, good luck!
Thanks!
Yeah.
Thanks. You too. It was great working with you.
Yeah. So guess what happened. So Mr. McAllister, he Oh hi. Lisa.
So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me
You know how they say one day a big meteor might come and crash into the Earth and kill everybody? Well, I think that would be a good thing.
Sure, Paul. No hard feelings.
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan. I like your style.
You got a brother up in Folsom. I know because I put him there.
How'd you like to make it 1960? I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D. A.
You wanna buy your brother ten years...? You don't have to say anything. Just look at this list and point. Here.
That obvious, huh?
Of course I am. What kind of question is that?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Yeah I know. Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side. He doesn't want any attention.
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
How'd she meet Patchett?
Tell me about Patchett.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
You say'fuck'a lot.
There's blood on your shirt. Is that an integral part of your job?
Do you enjoy it?
Did they deserve it today?
But you did it anyway.
Actually, it was two. You're different, Officer White. You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us. He makes us quit the life at thirty. He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us. Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
No. I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me. And that's all the news that's fit to print.
I don't know.
Forget I asked. It was a mistake.
So you saved her.
How'd you get to know so much about him?
We talked.
In the morning.
Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables.
Captain, what do you want?
Dudley, what do you want?
Yeah, I hate them.
He helped me out once. That's all.
Him and me both. Fucking Exley.
What do you want?
Doing what? Mowing your fucking lawn?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
How what, Wendell?
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation. That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely. Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell.
You lost me, Dudley. I don't know what you're talking about.
Sure, boss. Sure you can.
Rain check me, partner. I got something big going on tonight.
No. I'll tell you sometime. Not now. Don't want to jinx it. But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
It's confidential, Bud. Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. Hush Hush. I'll see you tomorrow. And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it.
You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
She told you?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Then something goes wrong. Meeks gets killed. Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house. The night he died, Stens was all mysterious. Said he had something big going down.
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
Dudley.
Dudley's guys.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
What?
Stay smart, Bud. We build a case. We play by the rules.
With a wrecking ball. You want to help me swing it?
We had one thing figured wrong. I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
Patchett's dead. He sent you after me. I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
I'm a homicide detective. Where were you last night?
Richard Stensland.
Officer White. How about Susan Lefferts? You know her?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve. This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating.
I don't have one. Lefferts looked beat up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it. How come?
No.
That's right.
Why were Lefferts'eyes black?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner. Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake. I use girls who look like movie stars. Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
No, Mr. White. Pierce Morehouse Patchett. Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you. If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address? I doubt she knows anything, but
Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White?
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
What do you want to know?
You mean beside the fact that thirty five out of forty five rounds were gratuitous? I can't think of anything.
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way. What are these smears in the blood?
But she's moving away from the door. Who was sitting at this table?
Exactly. At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
What do you mean?
Yeah, so...
And I'll promote you. You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
More or less.
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to'43.
Just show me where they are!
Did one of the officers work you over a little?
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago. Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy
That fucking Larry. I almost believed him.
Nothing, Ray. That Larry, he's a pisser. You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
Oh? you feel that way about people, too?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes. You were seen burning them. Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
Were you on hop? You were passed out when you got arrested. Were you hopped up, Ray?
Where do they get their stuff? Come on. Give me one to feed the D. A. Just a little one.
It's for your own safety. Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
What does that have to do
And what?
You'll make lieutenant inside a year. Patrol division?
Dudley, we've been over this.
I... No.
No.
No.
No.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did. Or my father.
No, Edmund. He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time.
So be it.
Yes, I do, sir.
Get on it.
Something's wrong. I feel it inside. Doesn't that sound crazy?
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin. Through his whore girl friend. I sent him to make the buy. The rest is history.
A vacuum, Edmund. That's what we have in Los Angeles. Sending Mickey Cohen up created it. My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
Absolutely. Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds. Anesthetize them. As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care. It's still a crime free city... for respectable people.
Something like that.
Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland. They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam. Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double dip for some blackmail. Charges got dropped. Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
Part of it has to do with a murder. I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
It's a private investigation. I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Not even with Exley?
I should've known. What's the Chief throwing you?
Yeah, Exley. What's the payoff?
You're playing an angle, college boy. You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching. If they're making you a detective, watch out. Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week. Next to you I'm clean. And smart.
Glasses.
Even I'm not that crazy.
Yesterday that might've meant something. Pull me off. You'd be doing me a big favor.
Transfer me, suspend me. Just leave me alone.
Yeah. My whole life.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
It's a simple question.
So what's the point?
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
Movie star hookers. Whatever you desire... It's Fleur fr Lis again.
High line whores. With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else? It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett. You want to talk to him?
She is Lana Turner.
Great. You get the girl, I get the coroner.
What are you talking about?
For the last time. I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
A vulgar term, but yes.
Lynn Bracken.
Why do men and women usually see each other?
No.
Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
Really? What did White say?
The way you've underestimated Bud White?
You sound like you mean it.
How about White?
I'll take your word for it.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him. He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do. That makes him dangerous.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
No. This is the means to the reality. But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
Like recognizes like. I'm pretty tough, myself.
Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.
Okay. Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
When?
Where is he?
On what evidence?
Absolutely not. Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without
Do you have any proof?
I'm not going to dignify youwith answers. If you'll excuse me, I've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for.
Beats me. Look, Jackie Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds. He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills. It's right around the corner.
Contract players at Metro. You pinch'em. I do you up feature in the next issue. Plus the usual fifty cash. Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
Jack! It's Christmas!
I like it! I like it!
Jackie, are you back on Narco? I need copy.
Don't know. I'm chasing picture books. Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies. It's well done stuff. I thought you might have heard something.
No. No, I've heard bupkis. Jack, I'll talk to you later. Call me when you get something I can use. Smut's from hunger. For sad sacks who can't get their ashes hauled
Down around my ankles.
You tight with the D. A., trash?
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund. Did you know Loew was a swish?
He's queer too. Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues. On screen and off. I'm getting him to fuck the D. A. for a hundred bucks. That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
Around.
Give me some Narco skinny. I want to put out an all hop head issue. Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars. Maybe tie it into the Rosenbergs. You like?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
He's dead. I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
No, Sergeant. I checked twice.
Oh, I know. A Fleur de Lis party, right?
Really? How?
Yeah. Me neither.
It'll be our secret.
They found him yesterday folded neatly in a car trunk. What about Zavitz?
They said he was behind an extortion scheme.
What'd he say to you?
What'd he give to you?
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.
Someone else?
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so
Who else have you told?
I'm doing a transfer now.
I'll come straight there.
They want to hold you in Contempt for ethics violations.
I have a professional relationship with Rachel Banks. She's the go between for a private investigator I use.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
Yes.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
That's who they are.
Yes.
Okay.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.
Why are they after me?
Wait. What do I do?
I don't know what that
I don't know anything.
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my life?!
What if
I'll pay you.
Move it.
I was worried about my hundred and twenty'K'.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
I mean did you call anyone.
Jesus!
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
I told you no calls.
I didn't use my name.
None of your business.
I was a traffic analyst.
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do. Hard line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic. Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud mouths. Anyone we wanted.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan every phonecall for target words like " bomb " or " President ". We red flag phone numbers or voice prints... whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
It was'72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to Ramparts and split.
Well... there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again.
Welcome to Santa's Workshop.
Yeah. Take a walk with me.
The NSA killed him.
Well, actually, you have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
They're here.
Them.
Here?
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
You're driving.
I didn't see a warrant. Did you see a warrant?
Fuckin A.
Yeah, I can see where that'd
Drive.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin'head off.
Goddammit
Same thing?
I was thinkin'about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
It'd never get through. All packages are screened, x rayed and then hand searched for explosives. You didn't like my " give me my money " idea?
Well how do I know what they're
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
What if what?
How?
Reynolds.
Who?
Shit.
Who's calling?
Jerry's on vacation'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name
My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you.
Oh, God, I knew it was stupid, I knew we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just sitting there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
That's my point.
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Because my life is being ruined.
Thanks. Who are you?
Your stuff?
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
A police report.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
About the accident.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
You tell me.
Are you invoking attorney / client privilege.
Than why can't you tell me.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Anything at all?
Was he with anyone?
Nobody gave you anything?
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
For your wife?
I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.
Uh oh.
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
You should take this seriously.
What?
What do you mean?
I'm sorry.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
Who did you work with to get the
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you
Have you been working with Rachel?
Sorry.
He's got his priorities?
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm hearing of
It's not true.
I've seen it.
Yeah... look
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking counselor for a year.
You told me you weren't seeing her at all.
Oh, please
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Leave this house.
Stacy
I know, but listen
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
I know.
It wasn't me.
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
I was in a car chase and a small explosion. Now listen to me: The NSA is behind this. They think that guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz, they think Zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them. So they're doing all these things electronically. The bank records, the surveillance. They're the ones who broke into the house. Now I know there's no reason to believe me. But I love you. And I love our son. So just believe me anyway. Please.
Good.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
The lingerie.
I was missing you.
Oh Christ.
I'm sorry about Rachel.
Who?
You did good.
Is this a fuckin'joke?
Why the hell would I
That ain't me.
You don't know who the fuck
This is fucked. You don't know who's in that
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
My wife's Jewish. But that probably doesn't matter right now.
It is fish.
Do you like fish?
DePinto?
Never.
What answer were you
Brill?
So you've said.
Other than Brill.
Why would I
I like our history. And I like you. I'd probably like Brill if I ever got to
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
How can I be sure.
Thank you.
Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg.
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The mob, Bobby!
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
I gotta go.
You being audited?
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
That's temporary.
Rachel
I'm gonna fix it.
Tell me about Brill.
I've never met him?
This conversation's over.
I don't have a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
What makes you think it's you?
You're a moron, you know that?
Who are you people?
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could
He didn't.
You're wrong.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
He didn't give me
Otherwise you may have to what?
Fuck you. You may have to what?
Otherwise you may have to what?
Fuck you. You may have to
Gimme the shoe.
I don't know you, I don't know your name, I don't know what the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin'sick of this! Get it?!
You're Brill.
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
I don't under
Why would the Union
My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer. Don't do anything'till I talk to you.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
She can't talk to you right now.
Because she's reading the newspaper, you asshole.
Some of'em.
Sure, go ahead.
In your dreams.
You staying for dinner?
She's in the kitchen.
Where've you been?
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
Who won the fight?
Yeah.
No " 900 " numbers.
No.
No.
Why don't you give'em a call.
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big screen TV, they took my blender.
I love my blender.
No, but they took my blender.
What?
Serve the ball.
That's what I want to talk to you about?
He's heard that it's escalated.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Just be cool.
Ssh!
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
The NSA's doing this'cause they think I have something. And they killed
They killed Rachel.
Yes.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
They're framing me.
I don't know. I mean
I don't know!
Jerry
You gotta
No, I
I won't make it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell'em to stop. Tell'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
Go to'em, Jerry.
So do I!
Turn yourself in.
Yeah?
It's been a few years.
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the main present, it's just, you know, a little
Tell me about it.
Are you okay?
Yeah, what's going on?
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Yeah.
What does that have to do with you?
Yes. But we can't.
Because we, and our associates, have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to shyster lawyers like you, because of shyster lawyers like you, and we'd just as soon sit back and sip a beer while you get ass banged by as many people as possible.
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
Then what's your goddam opinion?
Get it.
It means who's side are you on?
It's a bi partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and
What?
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. American buildings. Americans getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
What about the tapes?
The originals?
Am I to understand
Who?
Contact COINTEL. Profile. Assess the threat. Then cross check against Zavitz. Red flag the intersects and anything we can exploit. Also NRO. Pull up the keyhole tapes. I need to own him. I need to own him now.
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
Help from whom? Christ.
He's clever? He had help? Oh.
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
I don't care if he's Solomon with Saint Joseph sitting in his lap. I want the tape and I want him. Now is
Well... his real name's Edward Lyle.
Yes sir.
No sir.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
If they've looked at the video.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Explain that.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
Not yet. He's near " M " and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
This guy's carrying the flag for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
He's carrying the damn flag.
No thank you.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Then let's assume I don't.
A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it. Big car, slow car, chauffeur driven car, still a car.
They don't see foreign women in this market. How much did you pay?
Which stall?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
That insults them.
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this. I apologize if I appear abrupt. I am rusty at social graces. How do you find Cairo? Did you visit the Pyramids?
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
You felt obliged to.
So why follow me? Escort me, by all means. Following me is predatory, isn't it?
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
The Ostrich is a detour. A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method. Nothing to do with Zerzura. To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move. The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat otherwise the ostrich will run. At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards. When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer. Haunting the ostrich.
Be careful? You mean you or me? Who?
You sing. All the time.
Ask Al Auf. Alm  sy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
There's really no need. This is just a scrapbook. I should feel obliged. Thank you.
Look over there.
They're so untidy. I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Shall we be all right?
Yes is a comfort. Absolutely is not.
All true. Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind the Simoon so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
Water? Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical. Come on, come on! There's also a plant I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
Will you please come in?
Don't.
You sew very badly.
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it. Close your eyes.
When were you least happy?
Okay. And what do you love? Say everything.
What do you hate most?
Ownership. Being owned. When you leave, you should forget me.
Say you're feeling faint the sun.
I can't work. I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
I'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth. Swoon. I'll catch you.
Arabic?
It's beautiful. What's it about?
Yes. A different wife.
Of course. You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
Yes. Yes. Absolutely.
What? What? That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
Is he next? Do you drag him into your little room? Where is it? Is this it?
I've watched you on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races how can you stand there? How can you ever smile? As if your life hadn't capsized?
Dance with me.
Dance with me. I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
It hurts too much.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
Don't leave me!
Oh dear.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again.
Clifton your wife do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
I think the desert is, it's for a woman it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned
Very well.
It's Geoffrey under this.
And the people here don't want us. Are you kidding? The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials  isn't that right? Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood. Isn't that right?
Yes, of course. So, golly, where have you come from?
I see.
Do you have your papers, sir?
If I could just see some identification.
Right. And what's your name, sir?
Alm  sy would you mind just spelling that for me? What nationality would that be?
I understand you are agitated perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
What did you do?
I was talking about the girl.
Bermann!
Which we've overflown twice.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government. They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
Don't be so bloody na  ve. You know there's a war breaking out. This arrived this morning. By order of the British Government all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939.
Own the desert.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow. I'm going to do what I can, but  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
We didn't care about countries. Did we? Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans. None of that mattered, did it? It was something finer than that.
When's Clifton picking you up?
I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis. So if you need it  hard to know how long one's talking about. We might all be back in a month or two.
May God make safety your companion.
Please I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me. My wife is dying.
Fritz? What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
Your leg will be fine. A lot of shrapnel came out I saved you the pieces.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
Well, she is!
Oh.
Lady H said she thought you might be
Right.
Sweltering. Come on, I'll take you home.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
I do so love you. What do you smell of?
Marzipan! I think you've got marzipan in your hair. No wonder you're homesick.
We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Alm  sy smiles and walks on towards the others.
This is Clive Fenelon Barnes.
I won't hear of it. None of us will.
Did Katharine say? Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
Hana, I know you do!
I see. Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach. He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
No, but, no, not at all. I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and such good manners for someone worried about mines. That's all.
I don't think so.
What do I do?
So I follow the wires?
I follow the wires.
Okay. Get away from here. Quick.
You must get away. Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling. He's going to topple over if he cuts.
No. But he hands them over.
Don't talk. Check again. Lie flat and then cut.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
You wouldn't come to find me? That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban.
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste I'd been taught to re use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
The lamp was burning all night in his room. Caravaggio was there with him.
I mean home. India.
I know here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
It's what I've learned.
So one day we'll meet.
When he dies I'll catch up.
And what if he really is a spy?
If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
Oh God. Oh God.
I was going to say if you want to eat with us, ever  you and Lieutenant Singh 
Since Caravaggio turned up food seems to appear, so please.
You saved my life. I haven't forgotten. I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big a Giant and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
Only we have to go to work.
A bomb. At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Pardon me?
We can do that when we're very, very old.
I was looking forward to this evening.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
Yessir.
A more modest expedition, or even wait a year. Remind our families we still exist.
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
The windows don't open.
Interesting theory. Where's the proof?
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
Yeah. Me.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
Which you have in mind.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
How close?
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
Don't overestimate yourself.
Where are you at least?
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
That is of no interest.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
I can't?
I don't want to waste your time.
I have a proposal for you.
Meet me in front. Five minutes.
It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit.
Are you... okay?
That's good. Terrific.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
Excuse me?
So alive.
Of course I can. I have a note from mother.
Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way.
Not interested.
Good. I'll call the concierge. They can get you a new room, book your flight home, so forth.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property which I do not I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
Oh?
Maybe I should drive this time.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
But
Not funny.
You what?
Where's my bag?
What's my problem? You want a list?
And
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
Nice spot.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
That's when we'll do it. And we'll need every single day.
Precisely. You give me the Mask security code, I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, should be two or three million at least. Not too bad.
This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt... that Rembrandt!
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
True enough.
This isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
Hmmm.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
The lipstick thermal camera?
Charged. Receiver?
You were afraid of heights?
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
Aren't we all.
Something like that.
Popup, on floorboards. And
Let's mingle a little, shall we?
You can't be too careful.
What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.
The big job.
It's fifty fifty, less the cost of the dress.
I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.
Everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human.
The eight billion. From them to us.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ 6.
Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.
That's where the Mask comes in.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
There's always a surprise.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
Parachute.
There is one more thing.
But that's all behind us now.
I'm sorry.
Four billion dollars.
That's because you grew up rich.
I'm leaving from the Nathan Road Station at 6: 30 tomorrow morning. You could come too.
They'll each be positive the other guy did it. I fear an ugly international incident.
We can't help it, we... we've gotta...
Go!
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
You mean the seven billion.
Always in a rush.
Gin, really.
That's a joke, right?
Don't use language with me
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250, 000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
You're kidding, right? Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG  E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions.
250, 000 is all I'm authorized to offer.
His dry cleaners. You want him?
He's a low life. Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor. Jesus. Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
All of them.
Jesus.
How does someone get meningitis?
... or lemme guess toxic waste?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry  Vititoe?
Hell, no. I hate lawyers. I just work for them. You got a minute?
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know you're making all new curtains. Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy. You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
Thank you. It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know. And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy. Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts. All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
So the whole idea of selling the house don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
You bet. Paid for a check up for the whole family. And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either. They just took care of it. Just like that. We never even saw a bill.
Cause of the chromium.
The chromium. Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium it's poisonous?
Well then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG  E told me. They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns now. I was thinking Mandy really values your opinion...
Both.
Five million dollars?
And get someone to help around the house.
Oh my God. Oh my God.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
Yeah. I know.
Oh, please, it was long over by then. God damn, he made me look like some cheap
Bullshit. You told me I'd get half a million dollars. You told me I'd be set.
There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry. Being ignored, and being lied to. You did both.
I'm sorry about that. Really. But
Jane's the office manager. She handles payroll and petty cash. But she leaves early on Fridays.
Bullshit, you don't.
Out to lunch with the girls.
Good.
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
That's not how we work here. You don't just leave a message and take off.
Oh, yeah?
Well, that was nice of him. Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give'em the ax?
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.
So what made you think it was?
What medical records?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
Lemme see it, will you?
A ten percent raise and benefits. But that's it. I'm drawing the line.
Find out.
It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice.
I don't get why they'd do that.
And you can't?
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
Because I said no. Look the only reason PG  E's even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute. We add plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle of a toxic tort with a statute problem against a massive utility. No, thank you.
Bullshit.
Who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it.
Okay, fine. I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference
You think there's more?
Kinda like David and what's his name's whole fucking family. Okay, here's the deal if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up I'll do it. I'll take it on.
It didn't help, but no. The real problem's on the bottom.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
No
Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something.
What do you mean?
Oh, they knew. They had to know.
Me too. That's why I like it. It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
I would now.
Yeah, I heard that one before.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
Some guy in a truck he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking. Get me a beer.
He's gone. Did you get a license plate? Or a make?
I was just asking. Are you all right?
Yeah, I mind. You bet your ass I mind.
Erin, you're a big girl. If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with
Is that what you want?
Whoa. No shit.
So what are you thinking?
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Why the fuck should I respect her?
Gee, I wonder why.
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for " just a meeting "
Bullshit. You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Kurt thought? What about you? Do you think anymore?
You're emotional. You're erratic. You say any God damn thing that comes into your head. And I'm not saying that's bad. That can be great; that can be a lot of fun
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't
Bullshit. You stuck me in Siberia dictating to some God damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me. After all I've done for you, that's the thanks I get.
I know. I'm sorry. Do I get to hear what happened anyway?
And if you had to guess...
So why would PG  E offer it?
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be ten years before these plaintiffs see their money?
Fuck legal terms. We're talking about human beings here. Sick people. A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years. They need their money now! We gotta get'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed. We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to
When? Where?
Okay, good. I think I should be the one to tell'em, cause they trust me more than
The fuck I'm not. I don't care what the doctor says
Why not?
Fuck Kurt.
No, I'm serious. You know what Kurt Potter is? He's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place. He's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when PG  E offered 20 million. He doesn't work like us, Ed. There's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing.
You know what, Mr. Potter? I completely forgot your birthday this year. And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight. So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.
I was wrong.
I did. Both.
The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin. The luckiest son of a bitch in history.
Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing. Give him another chance.
Yeah. Yours is nicer.
Here what comes?
I wasn't gonna
Ed, I swear, I'm not
Good.
I think we should makes some changes.
Nope. And I didn't ask.
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding you gotta find some way to entertain your mind. So yeah, I took a look.
There was a lot of dull stuff vacation schedules, the like. But then there were a few memos about the holding ponds. The water in them. They had readings from test wells, stuff like that.
Well. There were a few documents that I somehow didn't get around to shredding. That I kept instead.
Ross.
You come to the right place.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig'em out for you.
Heck, yeah. Come on back. Just gonna need you to sign in here
You're married.
The fuck you don't. No one calls me Pattee. That heavy breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you. People are dying, Ross. You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it. I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.
Yes. There's straight up chromium does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
With repeated exposure to toxic levels God, anything, really respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration plus, of course, any type of cancer.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Hunh uh. What's that?
County water board. All righty, thanks.
I'm gonna hate it.
That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
George!
Hey, just so long as you see Him.
PG  Are you sure?
When?
I never forget, honey. I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
Oh, God, sweetheart, no. There's nothing on Earth I love more than you. Nothing. I promise.
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay? I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
Whose number do you need?
I said, whose number do you need?
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
Now, don't be like that. Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness?
Which number do you want, George?
Shit, yeah. I got numbers coming out of my ears. Like, for instance, ten.
Sure. That's one of my numbers. It's how many months old my little girl is.
Yeah. Sexy, huh? And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is. Seven is my son's age. Two is how many times I been married and divorced. You getting all this? 16 is the number of dollars in my bank account. 454 3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.
Return'em. Maybe you'll get your money back.
Cause I don't even know you.
I'm never here. I gotta leave'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
Great. Another deadbeat.
Yeah? And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
It's been a while. Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
Right.
I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
I can't call an exterminator. I can't afford one. God, I can't even afford my phone. I got fired.
Doesn't matter. Doesn't make one bit of difference. Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so... so nothing?
You are someone.
You're someone to me. You're someone real special to me.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life. They're gonna start holding up 7 11's any day now.
I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna hear it. I am doing the best I can.
I'm not in danger. I have a dead bolt. Remember?
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
Cause I can get a job. I will. And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again. Would that make you happy?
I know what they can sleep through, Erin. I probably know it better than you.
No, no jokes, I gotta pee. Just tell me about your day. What went on back there?
What? Beth? My Beth?
No, I wanna say hi.
Bull shit, Erin. Bullshit.
About what?
It's a pair of earrings. I saw'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought'em. And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with'em. Know how long ago that was? Six months. In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me. That's a long time.
I know. But still. Six months. I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend. Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of'em.
Yeah, you can. You could just quit. People do it all the time.
More than you need me.
I don't do favors for you anymore.
It's just the pain. It's only getting worse. I can't be a good wife. I can't be a good mother.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine. I don't even know how much they cost.
I had photos of my kids, plus a mug
There may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time, but this isn't one of them. Here, if you don't do the work, you don't get to stay.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
What?
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood he ran the dairy on Community seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other. I just figured it was something in the genes. And you know how it is you don't like to ask about things like that...
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich. I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about I guess they call it epidemiology? and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Who's Baxter?
Of course! Oh, gosh, of course
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong. And these guys Donna and Peter
Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say they both have some form of cancer.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him....
Yes, My Lord.
We've discussed this before.
No... there is another.
You must go to the Dagobah System... There you will learn from one who taught me: Yoda, the Jedi Master.
Luke... you are the only hope.
You don't know that. Even I cannot see their fate.
You're not ready yet. You still have much to learn.
But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with The Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path... as Vader did... you will become an agent of evil... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate, despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now.
Right.
That was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you.
Yeah...
I'm looking for a great warrior.
No, no! I'll stay and help you find your friend.
Oh, a Jedi Master. Different altogether. Yoda you seek, Yoda.
Of course, yes. But now eat we must. Good food, I have good food. Come, come.
Look, it smells good. I'm sure it's delicious But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
Because of my father, I guess.
How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am. Can't we get on with this already?
I have felt it.
Our destruction? Who?
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi wan could not have taught him so much that...
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
He will join us or die, My Master.
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
Thank you, General. But there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
Fine. But they'll have to take care of themselves.
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you. No one seems to know...
The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold.
It can wait.
We're in trouble!
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
He'll know when he gets back... Don't give me that look. Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me. If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else. I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
We?
Not you?
You probably don't. How could you? You're so terrified of your own emotions...
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss. You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one. I could have helped you plenty in that department... if you'd have let go for a minute. But it's too late now, sweetheart. Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Spare me please! Don't tell me about the Rebellion again. I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion. The result is you're as cold as this planet.
Sure... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.
Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self destruct....
Now don't panic. We don't know that.
I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried.
Let's hope so... it's just the chance we need.
Aren't I? Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
We've got to get out of this shower.
Right. I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones...
That should do nicely.
You don't look angry.
Beautiful.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Where have I heard that before?
You could be a touch warmer, though. Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right.
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
I do not!
Outside, in the cave.
But the tremors have stopped.
It's not my fault. I can't under stand it!
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
That depends. Where are we?
Well, sometimes... Ah hah, I knew it! Lando Calrissian.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con artist... all around scoundrel...... your kind of guy. The system is called Bespin. It's a ways from here, but reachable.
A Tibanna gas mine. Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
No. But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know...
You look silly.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
Well, I do trust him. Lando's an old friend. Must have been an accident.
Me either. They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
That's two you owe me, junior.
Are you kidding?
I'll bet.
What have you done to my ship?
I'll have my people get to work on it right away. Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.
Nothing. I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon sible leader and businessman... But you wear it well.
This ought to be good.
Luke? I don't get it.
That was never mentioned. Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
No.
That wasn't the bargain. You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in
I must say, your beauty is unpar alleled. Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
Not actually.... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well... unofficial.
And when do you betray us again?
This is no time to be choosy, honey. What do you say we debate this later? There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
Sure I did... once. It turned out lousy.
What?
Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter. It's not much, but...
I'll be back later.
Me too. I was afraid.
That's just great. Why doesn't everyone just take off?
First Han, now you. When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself?...
Jabba the Hutt?
Snow creatures... they're here?!
To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
Yes, but by what standard, ask I? Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.
Okay. I'll give it a try.
That they are.
That would matter not were The Force flowing through you. Higher you'd jump! Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.
Anger, fear, aggression! The dark side of The Force are they. Easily they flow... quick to join you in a fight. Beware, beware, beware of them. A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
Lord Vader... Is the dark side stronger?
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
But tell me why...
What's in there?
My mind fills with so many images.
I see a city in the clouds.
I see them!... They're in pain... they're suffering.
And I too.
There is much Obi wan did not tell you. Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
That won't be necessary.
It won't get through the blockade.
Me, too. Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse. Have we fed them? Like raw steak or something?
Good God.
What d'you mean, pretending? They are dressing. Where'd they get those clothes?
My name is Lewis Lewis Dixon.
That primitive apes can talk.
And Earth will be destroyed just as we saw it. Only, since fleeing it, we have passed through a.... backward disturbance in time did you notice the Date Meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship? and we have returned to Earth almost two thousand years before its destruction. That is another reason for keeping silence. Our human captors would not be edified to know that, one day, their world will crack like an egg and fry to a cinder, because of an Ape war of aggression.
I did not call her mad. I merely asked her if she was. And I repeat the question. Are you mad?
A display of primitive apparatus
With food?
I don't believe it.
Yes, but don't take any chances.
Keep him in cold storage till the reports in. Then send him to Taxidermy. He's a museum piece.
Humans?
I like you.
Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
Some areas have power they're on line to San Onofre.
All right, so I made another deal.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
Say goodnight, Carjack.
No, that sucks. How are we getting out?
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off. Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
That's the deal.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Call me Snake.
Defense against what?
All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a. m.
So you want me to take her out? Is that an order from the President?
By the way who gives me the anti toxin?
Not you?
Good.
Locked.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
The name's Plissken.
Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.
Down that way.
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin'fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man.
Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.
A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.
No screamin'shit.
Who?
Like hell I do.
The freeway.
It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
Well, I'll think it over.
I've been doin'that all my life. Might as well do it in L. A. Everybody else there is.
Who ain't?
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
Uh uh. Bluebacks.
Take Excalibur. Find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it.
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse. Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
I will not. You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms, under the eyes of God.
It is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must.
But your life and lands are far from here.
It is the old wound, that has been opened. I have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. Let my heart do its job, my King, and pump me empty...
... Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was...... Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must.
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
I want to thank you.
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
Thank you.
What book is that?
What?!
Guenevere...
You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge.
Good and evil; there is never one without the other.
A king should be afraid, always. The enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle, on the deer paths of his forest, or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest, in here.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
What is this place, Merlin?
Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
And you are the great King? The lords have rebelled. Invaders attack the coasts. Crops don't grow. There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. Only I am feared. I will be king. You may have lost Excalibur, but I have found my own weapon of power. There.
I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.
I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've sewn my father's wounds more than once.
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.
Without Lancelot?!
And you cannot love me...
And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?
I have kept it.
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
Why?
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
Who?!
Me?
To me? But why?
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
It is.
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
A lovestruck page!
Maybe... maybe...
I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
I swear it.
The child is mine, Uther. I have come for him.
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
They are not weapons, my friend, but truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your allies will turn against you. Give me the child, Uther, I will protect him. Go back to your war tent.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
Hiding?
How about Lankaster Merrin.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
No, he's working on another book.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
Ten maybe twelve years ago, in Africa. The exorcism supposedly lasted for months. I heard it damn near killed him.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
Oh not to bad, kinda like the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story, but other than that it was terrific.
And you got an invitation.
Dinner at the White House.
Just five or six people.
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
Didn't who tell me?
What's Burke got to do with it?
Yeah, well I guess you should've.
Phonograph.
Sure you won't change your mind?
It's serious?
May I ask...?
Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Groceries maybe? A package?
Oh, I see.
Never mind.
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked " What's this fungus? " we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...
Rats?
Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
A man to see you.
How are you today?
That's good.
It affects concentration.
A stimulant.
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression but that's out of my field.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Lies?
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying uncharacter
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
She used those words?
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist?
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Mrs. MacNeil the problem with your daughter is not her bed, it's her brain.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
Are you sure?
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
I'm Father Karras.
Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?
Where?
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Pretty close?
Did he tell you about my party?
About my daughter?
He didn't mention?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
On what?
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
You wouldn't.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I didn't get you?
Oh yeah, since when?
Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.
To begin with it could make things worse.
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
No, you don't understand. Your daughter
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
Did you know my mother died recently?
No, is Regan aware of it?
It's not important good night.
What do you drink?
It's fine really, sit.
Have you told him what's happening?
Well I think you should.
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession.
She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.
What kind of stuff?
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
We'll see when we get home okay.
We'll see Regan. Now about those party invitations.......
Oh it's so funny.
Where?
You know how?
Oh yeah, well let's both play.
Captain who?
Who's Captain Howdy?
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Oh I bet he is.
You think?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Oh you wouldn't talk, well I didn't have my make up man there.
Well what would you like to do? Got any ideas?
Oh I love you.
Mr. Dennings?
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin'to do.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Well your thinking's not so good.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
God gets lonesome for us, Rags. He wants us back.
Oh, honey.
Make it stop, it really hurts! Mother! Make it...
Hi Father.
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
There's only one.
Save your servant
Be unto her o'Lord a fortified tower.
And also with you.
O'Lord hear my preyer.
The Lord be with you.
Can you give her something?
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
Always.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
Really?
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church  you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to'M'Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
It's possible. Possible however 
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Look, Father this is hard for you please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Who?
I could have you deported, you know that?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Yes
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
Give me the keys!
It's my goddamn car!
Give me the keys.
Yeah, come on in.
Mondays.
Now? Why not tomorrow? After the show.
What about tomorrow?
Twelve years.
So?
Vacation? Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Maybe next time.
Just the same.
Honey...
Frank.
Oh. What do you do?
My brother and I. One each.
What's wrong with the kid?
The fire. The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.
Come on, friend. I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee. You'll forget what you're angry about.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
When they coming in?
How we...? What, are you kidding me?
That's not the point.
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
Jack.
Jack.
Christ, will you look at your hair?
No one's gonna be looking at my hair. Come on, we're on.
Of course, back then, things were a little different. I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil. We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?
Count it.
Count the fucking money, Frank.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
Fuck him. Great. Terrific. Fuck him.
You're their uncle.
They don't. They're always asking about you.
It was an accident.
Cindy.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
What d'you say, Willie? Tighten her up?
You look awful.
Really. You sleeping?
Seeing anyone in particular?
Because I'm your brother. Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
Uh uh. How about you? You seeing anyone?
It's only a ring. Not a collar.
No, I mean it.
We gotta go, Jack.
This time you gotta go.
You gotta go.
Your older brother.
Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.
Her hands. Like that.
Frank?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
So talk to me tomorrow. After the gig.
What're you talking about?
Honey, it's only Uncle Jack. You remember Uncle Jack.
The trees. The flowers. Nice.
Yeah... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains. Look good as new.
The hell you don't.
Bullshit. Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
No?
What was it like?
That how you see it?
Hey, you weren't there. Right?
I been thinking maybe we should make some changes. I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
It's more like 40 60, wouldn't you say?
That's what we agreed.
I'm not unhappy.
Frank. Fuck it. Okay?
I'm grateful, Frank. How much? For the singer.
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
Thirty seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
I just don't understand. You would think someone... anyone...
All right. What's your name?
What's there to talk about? She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
You're getting cold feet about this.
Ma? Ma? Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador? Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
Okay?
I told everyone seven fifteen. Didn't I? Seven fifteen.
Just like the day of the auditions, right? Jesus. How's my hair?
Get out of here.
Get out of here!
I'll hit you, Frank. I swear.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
Jack, for crying out loud. Your bachelorhood's showing. Ah, here we go.
Yeah... Well, I gotta go.
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Just a lucky guess.
Very realistic.
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know. I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
Day. Wednesday.
Sunday.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
Unless you want the right.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know. I'm, flexible.
All night?
We're gonna be here a week?
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night. For a week.
Why would I mind?
Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
What's the matter with you? So the piano's a little out of tune. So what?
No! I never hear it! Maybe. Sometimes. I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So'Tie a Yellow Ribbon'sounds a little flat. So what? Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack. Nobody. So why should you care?
Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother?
What?
How dare you say you love me.
Really.
How long you been at it?
They stopped serving two hours ago.
Time flies, huh?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her. Makes me nervous.
Yeah, well, she's our girl now. I think we better keep an eye on her. There's trouble there. Hey, listen to this. Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy five years. You believe that?
Dedications. I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room. The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it. Daniels went crazy for the idea. And that's not all. Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability. Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard on for Susie.
Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere. Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
He's with the hotel. I called him.
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
He had to come quickly. It was a big leak.
You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always been a heavy sleeper. Unlike me.
The party's over.
Couple years.
April.
A useless talent.
I told you. It's a useless talent.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
Yeah, but he told you things. He never told me anything. Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
I could've. But he didn't want me to.
Maybe so. You ever go back there? Where it happened.
What?
What do you mean?
Be reasonable, Jack.
Cancel, Frank.
Better give her pneumonia.
Nothing. We get nothing.
What's it for?
What disease?
You don't know?
What channels it on?
Seventy one? What's seventy one?
What?
What?
Basketballs, Frank. You had us playing for basketballs.
What?
You weren't there.
Fuck you.
Oh... I was just hoping for something to drink. But it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of cooking sherry.
Right.
Yeah, fine.
Sure.
Bought it on the way over. Clean as a nun.
Oh, yeah, right. I forgot.
Good choice.
You know, that night, I... It just all came up.
I mean, you can play. You're okay.
Yeah. Larry Shelton. Blackie. Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
Right. It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Christ, that's right. How could I forget. What a nightmare.
I told Halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said:
So she's got a few sniffles.
What am I gonna do? Put a record player out there? Bad, Frankie. Bad.
Moran. Monica. The whole thing. It's my stage name. My real name's Blanche.
No romance, right? That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche. If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Candy Man.'Is that all right?
Well... thanks. Bye.
What do you mean?
What about me?
Punctuality. First rule of show business.
Just like that, huh? You're not even gonna give me a chance?
How should I take it?
So if I'm so'late how come you're still here?
So run a little longer.
You find a girl?
I sing now?
Don't leave a girl hanging. Second rule of show business.
What I mean is
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
What?
We'll talk about it later. Right now, you gotta get changed.
Where's your dress?
Is there a language problem here? Your dress. For tonight. Where is it?
That! You can't wear that!
It's orange!
Come on. We don't have much time.
A seven.
I wear a seven.
Save it for your wife.
Nine.
Nine!
Zip me up?
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
Oh, thanks.
You're a prince.
Right.
Did you hear it?
Give me that.
We are not a saloon act. We do not take tips from dirty old men.
We do not take tips. I'll apply this to the cost of the dress.
Sorry. It only plays static.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise. What's with the stars?
Virgins?
Jack?
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
It's paradise. That's what it is. Paradise.
Great?
Peggy Lee?
Wow. You ever see her again?
What do you say we send a bottle over?
Got another song for us?
Well then... shall we?
Huh?
Uh...
Decency? Hey listen, pal...
Forget it.
That song. I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
I'm gonna throw up, Frank. I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night. Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
Yes, sir. You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
Lucky for you. Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh... you want to count it, Jack?
How come?
Will I see you again?
Thanks.
Right. Bring him back.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Right. In there.
Yeah, yeah, I know. I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now?
All right. Hold on.
Save it. What's he look like?
All right. they lay the dead ones out in the cold room. I'll take a look.
Oh. Well, for Blackie then.
I don't know. It's hard figuring you two as brothers. Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.
Nice place. Fulla velvet. Even the bedspreads. Damn! Two fifty a pack and I go through'em like toothpicks. Twelve and a half cents a piece, you believe that?
Paris Opals. Twelve and a half cents. I sat down with a pencil and added it one day. But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best. Ah, here's a lost soul.
You kidding? We must've killed three pots in there. Anyway, I gotta get home. Rest the pipes.
Forget it.
Forget it.
Aren't the kids asleep?
So why's he do it?
Can't sleep?
It's the waves. God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
How's egghead?
In and out.
It's a shitty song.
What'd I say?
You're upset.
All I said was you were good.
What's that supposed to mean?
You were good.
You were good.
Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit!
Friend.
She's four feet tall. Ed?
Soap convention.
Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean. Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe. The older ones, they were okay. Nice. Polite. Pulled the chair out for you. But the younger ones... Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again. She thought she had it all figured out. But she wasn't so smart. There are killers with palms like a baby.
My father proposed to my mother in there.
Oh. So what's it doing here?
You sending me home?
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
He had a mind that escalated things.
He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
Ma didn't want it around. After.
Yeah... No.
Yeah, maybe... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
So...?
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure. You two.
Yeah.
Terrific. I'm doing vegetables next week.
Vegetables.
Well, this is some surprise. Hey... You don't look so good, pal.
Yeah.
Funny how life repeats itself, huh? Over and over. Like a song.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Like clockwork. You got a good memory, Jackie.
He's got blood in his eye.
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular. All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner. And breakfast.
Married.
My days are not the old days, genius.
The recent past.
How do you know?
Oh?
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Older than me.
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
Ever go to church?
Not so good.
Can I stay here tonight? Even if she comes here?
That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
You mean if I get sick?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say " thanks "?
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
I don't care he's manipulating it. That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
The last time I took orders from you I ended up with five years probation.
You shouldn't have brought me here... it's dangerous.
I'm not the same person you remember.
Five. No one knows you're his father. I thought someone might want to hurt him just to hurt you.
Why would he need more?
Or reactivated the first one.
They haven't found it yet Listen, Pollux...
I don't know. Everything's jumbled so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
Like...
And I bet I've kept that promise...
Being stuck in this rat hole when it blows. Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the Smithsonian.
For being one helluva guy.
She's only 12. Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying " I love you. "
Jon... we just remember how it used to be. You staying for a while or is this just a piss stop?
I'm late for surgery.
So is finishing my residency and passing my boards...
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Actually in this dream I was your mother.
Totally you were being very, very bad. You went up in the plane and jumped out. You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
No.
I don't know... Maybe because you've never needed my help.
You said you'd be here! You promised me you promised Jamie! What could be more important than that?
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave? Okay, go on! GO!
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis. You need to seek the help of a trained
Whoever you are, don't call again.
I don't know that. Maybe Jon's already dead.
Tell me what happened on April 9th 13 years ago.
What do you mean?
Or maybe all at once. There's a get together tonight at New St. Marks. For all the bureau chiefs and their families. He's insisted Jamie and I be there too.
The bomb. He's reactivated it. And everyone there is going to die.
I know Lazarro the first person she'd call is " me. " We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
Eve...
That's what they always say.
Damn right.
Go on.
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24 hour hard on. He's nothing like you.
Either way, come Saturday morning I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
What're you gonna do with me gone? You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs and only I can stop it.
Don't count on it.
It can't be. It's impossible.
What are you going to do, Castor?
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
Or what? You'll have me fired?
I've never been more certain of anything. Get everyone in position. And get the word out shoot to kill.
Castor Troy almost strangled me to death. Where the hell were you?
When did you start smoking?
Did it look like I was siding with him? Did it? You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared. Do you have protection?
I mean like protection.
Kim?
You always call me Miss Brewster.
The Admiral?
Castor's escaped!
Backing you up! Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
Trust me. You're gonna love it...
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside. Check it out. Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand? He's being treated for bone cancer at the V. A. Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid technology... Ooops! His radiation does just quadrupled.
I'm just having some fun.
All of them do. We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb. And we'll be rich.
Like I fucking care? I'm not just sitting here!
Just following your example.
What's that?
I had doubts too. I always looked at a desk as though it were a ball and chain. But something happened...
Jon, you're starting to remind me of me. Congratulations.
I just thought that under the circumstances you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
Okay, then. I leave it in your able hands.
As much as ever. Nothing.
The hospital.
Jon I don't have time to play games. There're leftovers in the fridge.
No.
You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage you wouldn't break the law. Remember what my brother called you?
Isn't that what all this is about? Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, your next assignment?
You always say that then you leave.
... That's great.
I'm late. Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
Okay, if you insist. But you drive.
Great? He's 17 you told her to stay away from him.
Yes, Jon. That Karl.
Yes.
Wait a second you hated Madonna. Didn't you?
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college. I almost married her...
Almost married. And almost a junior broker at E. F. Hutton...
She didn't want me to go to London. We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
God, no. I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia. You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
Adelle?
Why Jack?
I can see that, Alan.
That  s right. And auto supply...
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
It  s okay, Alan. I get it. I  m in your shoes, I  m thinking exactly the same thing... but here  s the thing. Business is business. Wall Street, Main Street, it  s all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell they  re gonna send their kids to college. It  s just people...
You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. You  re an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...
Oh, I  m hearing you, Alan. That  s not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine. And I don  t care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back... So do yourself a favor and don  t get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office.
It  s not good. Bob Thomas has secretly been talking to a European drug company. We  re not sure which one, Julia  s on it right now. Word is they  re willing to let him buy a minority stake and keep running the entire company. The Global people are up in arms. They say we should  ve been prepared for this. We  re in trouble here, Jack...
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu  Art of War  tricks?
That  s right. Okay, let  s make a quick stop at the kids  shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then I  ll run into the linen store...
I don  t know...
The aliens... In the mother ship. You look just like him.
You know how to make chocolate milk?
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Try not to be late because kids don  t like to be the last one picked up.
Bye...
Big Ed  s? Big Ed  s Tires? Why...?
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Mom liked it.
Right. That  s a major oversight... So if I  m Kate... I can  t really afford the finer things, my husband  s career is a crushing disappointment to me, I  m trapped in suburbia...
Ah. A classic...
Trouble at work?
It  s not Kate, is it?
You  re right. Why am I so competitive!? Compensation, I guess. Look, just focus, Jack. You can still pick up the spare...
She is relentless.
She said that?
Oh yeah... What is it about you?
Whoa... whoa... wait a second, Jack. You  re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Look, maybe I  m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one. A little flirtation  s harmless but you  re playing with fire here. The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor. You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
Screw the rules. I  m talking about the choice.
All I  m saying it there isn  t a guy in Union County who wouldn  t give his left nut to be married to Kate...
I don  t care if you  re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can  t park here.
How  d you know my name?
I never won anything in bowling.
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you... you played baseball, right? You  re doing well...
You never really talked to me. I wanted to talk to you, man...
Look, can I just borrow your car?! I promise it  ll be returned!
Yes you do...
A lucky streak, huh?
You just said everyone needs something.
Wow. It must be great being you. You got it all.
Sure it's about you. But it's about society, too.
It  s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by laws of your alt fate contract...
Basically, it  s my car now. Get in.
No? C  mon, Jack... I  ve got everything I need, I don  t have regrets, that  s just not for me... sound familiar?
You? What about me? I  m working hard for you here, Jack. On Christmas too! Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way. I was moved...
Look, eventually, everybody gets one... some of  em take a couple seconds...... some of  em take a lot longer...
As long as it takes to figure it out. Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Because you got to figure it out for yourself. Are you listening to me?
What're you talkin'about?
Get out!
I thought I saw you notice it at the kids  recital.
C  mon, as soon as I put them down, you  re gonna grab a couple... you always do...
Something like that.
You  re a nurse?
Is there something going on between us?
Okay, you  re right, we  ve been dancing around this for years...
Mr. Mintz? I don  t think so... building  s closed pal. You  ll have to come back tomorrow.
I don  t care who you are. It  s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Thank you.
That  s the kind of thing you can really build on...
I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always...
You want me to handle him? I think I  m ready...
I also put side two of London Calling on there...
I know we  ve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Right, for us. But... I  m afraid that if you get on that plane...
We're being responsible. Go. Get on the plane.
The city? New York City? Why?
Jack... don  t even start...
You look forward to this party all year. What  s with you today?
Why not?
She  s your dog, Jack.
Fine, she  s the kid  s dog. Let  s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
You  re having a bad day, I  ll go with you... actually, there  s no way in hell you  re gettin  me back out there...
HEY!
I  m working on a new deal now...
Whatever you say... honey.
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Look at me like you haven  t seen me every day for the last twelve years...
Those shoes were twenty five dollars. C  mon, take it off. We  ll go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.
Excuse me?
What  s in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes?
I think it worked out okay, don  t you?
Good, Jack. Maybe we  ll keep her.
We were young... Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
You can  t really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...... who knows what would  ve happened if you hadn  t stepped in at the store.
How would you look at it?
C  mon, you know what I like to hear...
Then say it... just say it to me...!
What? You make me hot...
I know that, but...
How do you even know about this place?
I think it may help us but there  s a slight chance it could make things worse.
No. Well, maybe a few things. But mostly just different...
Now... I don  t...
C  mon, Jack, you think there aren  t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I  m doing in New Jersey...
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone... and you  ve seen my pay check.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
Way out...
For the week?
A company called P. K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
Annie goes to a great school.
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
I can  t believe you want to move back into the city. I thought the reason we left was because we didn  t want to raise the kids here?
Jack.
You  ve been Jack Campbell. And that  s always a good thing...
Please, just promise me you  ll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you don  t, then it  s like it never happened and I don  t think I could live with that.
I promise. Come to bed, honey.
Paris?
To Paris. Paris, France.
So you  re not at a non profit firm?
You  re not married, are you?
Not exactly... Can we just take a minute here? Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
Don  t get on that plane!
Please. Let  s just go have a cup of coffee. That  s all I  m asking for. I  m sure there  s another flight to Paris tonight.
And God love you for it.
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
I need you, tiger..
Aspen.
Not by a long shot.
Not exactly. I  ve seen you on CNBC. You look taller in real life...
Okay... you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. You  re a scotch man, single malt, not because it  s trendy but because you  ve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand...
You won  t regret it... Tommy! Set Mr. Conlin up with four B. F. Goodrich G Force T / A  s...... and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
Kate? No, there  s no one here named Kate. Is that good enough for you?
No... I  m not...
Last night was great...
Thanks. You're not bad yourself...
Tonight.
I'm taking the train...
Christmas? It can  t be Christmas...
Hey, kind of giving up Christmas day for my ex boss here.
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
I mean...
No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round
I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
I had it at four.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
Solid.
I should have done more, run more tests
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
He's smart, powerful, successful
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask
O kay. We'll skip that question.
We're working as hard as we can
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss up.
Don't you wander off, boy.
Reed?... Sue?
Give me a mirror...
Baby, you're scaring me.
About me? How sweet.
Where do you think? With Sue.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
What did he do to the uniform?!
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works analyzing every little step before he takes one
No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
I don't really know. A compound organic metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks
I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and
Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
... and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
Now.
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Sweet.
Is that what you call it? " Real "?
As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
But Johnny... you can't fly.
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
Then what is it?
Reed's disaster. You know, I half think he did this to me on purpose.
And that's a good thing?
Front page?
Ben's still out there
Ben did this?
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool
I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
That's good. That's uh... good.
Which was?
Sue... look at your hands.
If it happened to him, then it could...
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed... I'm saying it now.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm
Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
You can't leave them out there.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to
Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job
Skeptical...?
Normally not. Unless it's an Arterio Venous Fistula
Not until the very last second. We must think of something... Something to save the situation.
I know that. But what's the maximum?
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
Let's find what the devil's holding them up! Contact the Proteus!
What're you getting at?
Along the Optic Nerve to the Eye.
Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him!
How bad off is he?
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others
I wouldn't know if he's trying to save him or kill him.
Say that again?
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Trip? Where to?
You mean going along?
Wait a minute! They can't shrink!
But I don't want to be Miniaturized!
Not even for a minute! General Carter, sir, I'd like you to reconsider your choice. I'm just not the right man for a mission of this kind.
Where can I get a cab back to town?
He's blanked out on that one particular point.
Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.
Difficult? He's impossible!
With no laser
I I want to say...
Thank you for volunteering.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
A long time, with one man.
A surgeon might...
I've got a source. All I have to do is tap it.
A great deal more than that, I believe...
What gives you that idea?
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
What do you mean?
It's too late now. We must go on.
That's not the purpose of this mission. Captain keep a straight course until you're in the clear.
If we can go in past the Oculomotor Nerve...
I've done all I could with the laser.
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
I know only too well what's in the balance, Doctor. And it's not my ego, damned or otherwise.
What's that?
Everything can be divided in half, no matter how minute.
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Yes... We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
It's too late!
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage or surgical assassination.
Request removal, Mr. Grant.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just
Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
You have no right to blame Duval
I I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
It's possible
The Lymphatic System drains off excess fluid from the Tissues. Without it, we'd all swell up like balloons. He reaches the console, begins to take out a new chart.
How long will it take to get from here to the Removal Point?
Nothing has changed as far as authority goes! He is going to operate! Not in the little time we have left! There's no chance of success! It's sheer suicide for all of us!
I can't tell you.
I can't tell you that either... Excuse me, Mr. Grant, but you've got a smudge on your cheek.
And she said it was indelible...
That makes two of us.
That's cutting it mighty close for a perfect fit.
Remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus.
Berserk nothing. He's the one who's been sabotaging the mission... Get this on. Hurry!
We feel great, don't we? Just?!
Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine just fine!
Not to the valve. But we've lost too much air to make it the rest of the way.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Well, see, there's a minimum charge of four dollars. Long term parking charges by the day.
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS
Drop that fucking money!
Is this a fucking joke here?
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
Can I see your license and registration please?
That's my license and registration. I wanna be in compliance.
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
Yeah, well, it depends on the artist. You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no complaints. Waiter!
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
Yeah, yeah, Jesus I'm sayin', we'll stop for pancakes, then we'll get laid. Wuddya think?
... Would it kill you to say something?
" No. " First thing you've said in the last four hours. That's a, that's a fountain of conversation, man. That's a geyser. I mean, whoa, daddy, stand back, man. Shit, I'm sittin'here driving, man, doin'all the driving, whole fuckin'way from Brainerd, drivin', tryin'to, you know, tryin'to chat, keep our spirits up, fight the boredom of the road, and you can't say one fucking thing just in the way of conversation.
I need... unguent.
Huh?
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you
Well, okay, it's
Yah, well, that was a mix up, then.
Yah. But it's not a whole pay in advance deal. I give you a brand new vehicle in advance and
Okay.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
Yah.
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
So why don't you just ask him for the money?
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh
Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that.
Blood has been shed, Jerry.
Three people. In Brainerd.
That's right. And we need more money.
We need more
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand.
Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
IS IT, JERRY? You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask'em!
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yah, okay, but, uh
... Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now
Okay, real good, then.
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
You're sittin'here, you're talkin'in circles! You're talkin'like we didn't go over this already!
We had us a deal here for nineteen five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen five!
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it! And here ya are and you're wastin'my time and you're wastin'my wife's time and I'm payin'nineteen five for this vehicle here!
Yah, you don't need that. Now were you thinking of financing here? You oughta be aware a this GMAC plan they have now, it's really super
Yah.
Yah, right o.
So he says,'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin','only he doesn't use the word jerk.
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin'and he says,'What do ya think about that?'So I says,'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then. '
And he says,'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.'And then he says,'Geez, I'm goin'crazy out there at the lake. '
Well, Ecklund  Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny lookin'.
Just a general way.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Ya got that right.
No, I gotta hey, Norm, I thought you were goin'fishin'up at Mile Lacs?
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence. A Shep Proudfoot.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Yah.
Oh, yah? Twin Cities?
You're not a C student.
And yet you're gettin'C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
You know what a disparity is?
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin'out fer hockey.
You're sayin'what're you sayin'?
What's the next step here, Jerry?
Yah.
Yah, geez, Scotty. I'll go talk to him.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
Yah.
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any. These men, they just want money, see.
No, no, nothin's goin'wrong here. Grandad and I, we're we're makin'sure this gets handled right.
Yeah, but
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here
Huh? Do you mind if I sit down I'm carrying quite a load here.
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson
Uh huh. Well, I'm a police officer from up Brainerd investigating some malfeasance and I was just wondering if you've had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks specifically a tan Cutlass Ciera?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
Okey dokey, thanks a bunch. I'll let you get back to your paperwork, then.
No, I
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know? Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
So how do you have you done any kind of inventory recently?
But do you know that for sure without
Yah, but
I know, but well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin'my job here.
Sure right now! You're darned tootin'!
Yah, real good.
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the
Yah, so we're all set.
But the deal's already done, I already got the money
Yah, well, they exist all right.
Well, but see, I don't have'em in front a me why don't I just fax you over a copy
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Yah, how much money was that?
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Okay, real good, then.
Well... yah.
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin'out for ya?
Well, what do ya mean?
What the how's Jean?
Yah!
Yah! I... those are in the mail.
Yah.
Yah.
... Yah.
Where're you going?
Norstars.
OOOoooh! His reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd.
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money
Lot. It's a limited
I mean a parking lot.
Yah, well, it's a chunk, but
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him. I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin'there?
No kiddin'?
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
Yah.
... Huh?
We're good to loan in.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin'it to us.
I'm not talkin'about your damn word, Jerry. Geez, what the heck're you?... Well, look, I don't want to cut you out of the loop, but his here's a good deal. I assume, if you're not innarested, you won't mind if we move on it independently.
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin'Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin'call a professional!
It's my money, I'll deliver it what do they care?
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin'to a professional. He points at a briefcase.
No, see
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh
Well, that's okay, I just
Carl somethin'?
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Geez, you okay, Margie?
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Let's go take a look at that trooper.
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
Yah.
No way.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
So I got the state lookin'for a Ciera with a tag startin'DLR. They don't got no match yet.
Yah?
Oh...
Yah, that's a good one.
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I 35?
Oh, yah?
Yah.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge. I'll fix ya some eggs.
Ya gotta eat a breakfast...
No, that's okay.
Yah.
Yah, that's me.
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Yah how are you doon?
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
I see that! That's great!
You're livin'in Edina, then?
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married you have kids?
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey ya remember Linda? She was a year behind us.
And then I, and then I been workin'for Honeywell for a few years now.
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin'like your achievement.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out Linda passed away. She, uh...
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
It was a tough, uh... it was a long She fought real hard, Marge...
Oh, ya know, that's, uh what can I say?...
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
It's okay, Mike Should we get together another time, ya think?
You were such a super lady... and then I... I been so lonely...
Yep.
Nope.
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Now, I saw some rough stuff on your priors, but nothing in the nature of a homicide...
So you think you might remember who those folks were who called ya?
Yah?
... Well, yah. Who's this?
... Mike Yanagita!
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's
Well, it was nothin'specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin '
Linda.
Linda Cooksey?
So... they didn't...
Oh. Oh, my.
Oh. Geez.
Geez. Well geez. That's a suprise.
Yah.
Gustafson's accountant.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Sorry didn't copy.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Copy.
There's the car! There's the car!
Don't go in! Wait for back up!
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Prowler needs a jump.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
Not on your feet too much?
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Was it reasonable?
Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good.
Your mallard?
Norm, that's terrific!
Hautman's blue winged teal got the twenty nine cent. People don't much use the three cent.
Yah.
Yah, I guess.
And his wife?
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
Oh, my.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
Yah. Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding.
He's at
We gotta protect Jean. These we're not holdin'any cards here, Wade, they got all of'em. So they call the shots.
Yes. We're men. Men is what we are.
They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
Better than I've ever been in my life.
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
You are?!
You know about the guy who invented it? I hear all kinds of things. Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution. They say he only sleeps one hour a night. You know about this guy? Tyler Durden?
You want me to de prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
He was full of pep. Must've had his grande latte enema.
Yes.
Hmm?
" Abuse " the copy machine. There's an image.
I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.
What about this? Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant. In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut. I won't need to come to the office. I can do this job from home.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
You need to lighten up.
Red and blue Tuinal, lipstick red Seconals.
I'm on to you. You're a faker. You aren't dying.
Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying. But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying.
Telling me off. Is it going as well as you hoped...? "... Mr. Taylor. "
Go ahead. I'll expose you.
These are my groups. I was here first. I've been coming for a year.
Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.
Yeah.
Please. Can't we do something...?
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
You're kidding.
I want brain parasites.
I want that.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
Deal.
In case we want to switch nights.
That's the idea we split them.
I found a new one.
It's for men.
Look, this is a bad time...
I'm just on my way out...
This could go on for hours.
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
What the hell are you doing here?
Worth every penny.
I don't know...
She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book.
No, thanks.
There?
Here.
No.
You feel nothing?
I wish I could return the favor.
Uh... nah.
Really... I mean it. Have you been going to your groups?
When?
I don't know.
That... sawing and hammering.
Guy or girl?
Why would you get bent if I asked?
You're afraid to say.
He's not here.
He's not here! Tyler's not here anymore! He's gone away!
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Is this a trick?
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Is that what you're calling it?
You fuck me, then snub me. You love me, you hate me. You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole! Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
What did you say...?
Say my name.
Say my name! What's my name!?
Marla, no, wait...
I'm sorry, I...
Marla... I need to talk to you. It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
I've done you enough favors.
Two sides? You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
What?
Whatever. I'll take my food to go...
You have to get out of here. Leave as soon as possible. Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
Marla...
What?! You're sorry? I don't believe that for a minute.
... And you open the door and you step inside. We're inside our hearts. Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light. That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light.
Somehow, I realize all of this the gun, the bombs, the revolution is really about Marla Singer.
Oxygen gets you high. In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths...
I mean for a living.
Thank you.
What?
Well, uh... great.
All gone.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit. The trendy paper lamps, the Euro trash shelving unit, am I right?
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Delivered from bullshit colors like " Cobalt, " " Ebony, " and " Fuchsia. "
What list?
I don't... think so.
Well, I have to file a claim...
Don't I?
God, it's late. I should find a hotel...
Yeah.
I don't follow...
Huh?
No, I...
Would that be a problem?
Can I stay at your place?
Thank you.
What's that?
What?
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
A nice, big cock.
Go ahead. Say it.
No. That's a good thing, isn't it?
Me?
Alright, go crazy. Let'er rip.
Surprise me.
But a good strange.
We've crossed the threshold. You want to call it off?
The fight.
This fight, pussy.
Anyone.
I know that.
Same here.
I don't know how Tyler found the house, but he'd been there for half a year.
What?
Show off.
Alive or dead?
Hemingway. You?
Okay... Ghandi.
You?
Good. This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
Hey... don't knock librarians.
She needs an exorcist. This isn't love. This is sport fucking.
Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
Promise you won't.
Promise?
That was three times you promised.
Shhhhhh! I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't...
This clear layer in glycerin. We'll mix it back in when we make the soap.
Guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this.
Shut up. Our fathers were our models for God. And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
We don't need him...
Yeah. Where you headed?
Okay, and... and...
I thought you did.
What is it?
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning? You and I started fight club together.
What do you want? A statement of purpose...?
Should I E mail you? Should I put this on your " action item list? "
What do you want to know about Project Mayhem?
We are the all singing, all dancing crap of the world. We are all part of the same compost heap...
I'm not asking you to.
I don't think that's true.
I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat! It's not a seminar! You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know about life, about friendship, about you and me.
... is over.
" Applicant? "
" Training? " Tyler...
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
You broke your promise. You talked to her about me.
Why did you do that?
Why do people think anything?
Is this really news to you?
Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me...
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
It's okay. We okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
Wrong, wrong what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
You took me to the house.
You have jobs.
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
... go through with this? What are you going to do?
... stop me?
... to let this happen!
... your sentences! They're our sentences. Get your mind around that.
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago. Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
Fuck you.
You want out?
Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons. You need to get with the program. Seven minutes. Let's get out of here.
Defuse the bomb.
Defuse the bomb?
This is the beginning. We're at ground zero. Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Please...
What?
Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
Why can't I get rid of you? Why can't I just wish you away?
No, no, I don't. I thank you, I really do. Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
Noooo, please...
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
I'm doing this for us.
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
You will. You know you will.
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Appreciate something.
Look at me...
My eyes are open.
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Excuse me?
Now wait, there's been a mix up. Everything's changed...
Abort the plan.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
But, this is Project Mayhem.
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Robert Paulson?
Irvine? Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
Really?
Ain't that something?
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
Did you hear what I just said?!
Okay! Okay, fuck it! Use the basement! Get off me!
Alright, Christ! Fucking let me go!
Let go of me!!
They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers. Raymond, you're going to die.
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so and so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
I... I don't know...
Stuff. That means you have to get more schooling.
Yeah, how?
Nice work. Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me. But I doubt you'll survive that long.
What list?
That still doesn't make sense. You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to. But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first.
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon. When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in your face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it. It usually means the difference between life and death.
That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
I can practically taste the water in my throat. And something else. The smell of flowers...
So let's do it.
Are you crazy? What makes you think you'd survive?
Six duds in a row.
Yeah, fuck'em. No offense.
He probably already knows we're coming.
She had the baby?
What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago? You're nuts.
What about the rest of you? Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona. Was Route 18 your first choice?
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours.'Course, missed the show...
Who?
Jorge. When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off.
Do you want to deliver this baby?
May we come in?
Take a guess.
She did.
Anyway, I guessed it right and won these.
But why single me out? What am I in the great scheme of things? You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man.
I never mad it. The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.
You're not listening to me! You have to do something!
Do you remember what triggered it all?
They're next on the list. We have to find them.
I did. And right now, I don't think she cares.
Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?
You said she was going to drive into a lake. How can she when she's in protective custody?
I wasn't worried about us.
Impossible. She was on the onramp.
I can live with thaaaa
For Christ sakes girl, take a breath.
When I die. Is it gonna hurt?
Would you take these? And if I die... Could you throw all my drugs out? Paraphernalia, porno, you know... Anything that would break my mom's heart.
You think... You think those guys were b. s. ing us today or what?
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
" It? "
Then, let's go see him!
That's him, but... he's not here.
Remember the gate number?
Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four / Twenty five, as in, month and day... that's a reach.
Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence.
Nothing is... anymore.
When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
All I owe is these people. To live my life to the fullest.
It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin'" Stepmom. "
No. I saw it. I saw it!
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
Not with us in the fuckin'car!
I know what you're doing! It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there. But this is real, isn't it? You're taking me home now?
What kind of raggedy ass rescue you call this?
What's that?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
You stopped.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo! I swear to Christ.
That's what I'm here for.
We're leaving tonight, not in a week.
Home on my strobe.
Batteries not included.
I was in the brig. They gave me a deal. I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M 19. He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value. Seemed like a good idea at the time.
I've seen worse places.
Damn! Leeches.
I had it cupped.
Brewer. Does a jet make noise?
What's that?
Yeah. Dinky dau, that's me. Hey, Co. You wanna meet Jake the one eyed snake?
Pirates? No kidding?
Can't tell. Pretty tall. He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Torture cage. Can't stand... can't sit... for days. Sometimes weeks.
You never been in one of those things.
What... whattaya do?
Hold your pantyhose. Here, gimme a hand.
Forget it.
Why's that?
Crazy motherfucker.
Intelligence work.
It's nice there. He's probably digging every minute. Got a surfboard. Breaking girls'hearts.
Why'd they want us?
Let's go.
I do?
Invulnerable.
Go United States. See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics. Buy Cadillac. Watch " Dynasty. "
I know. I go with you.
That's an order.
What's the job?
Why me?
Where?
I'm not jumping blind.
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue. You are phase one. Your two man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
Negative. Absolutely not. The phase two assault team will get them out.
Don't look so disappointed. It should be hairy enough... even for you.
Typical...
What?
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
He... took it.
Nice work.
Black. No sugar.
It's not necessary.
That's a pretty hairy ride. Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.
Not my people.
Don't dance me, Kirkhill. You'll be walking funny.
Word came down... they wanted an answer. And they knew the answer they wanted: no POWs. But it had to look good. Best effort. The whole dog and pony show.
" Terminate with extreme prejudice. "
What that?
Man, you are one scary looking motherfucker!
I could a couple of days ago. Gonna be... stiff.
Mind if I sit down?
That depends on you. Christ, look at you. I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
Hard to believe. You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken. No sense of humor. What did you expect? An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?
You're not.
Plus, what else? Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
What did you want?
You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.
You got it, sir.
Yeah.
Yes! They'll be in soon.
No, thank you.
Fine.
What?
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
I think some people are meant to be alone. Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts...
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them... I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
I'm paying you.
Yeah!
Jack, he's starting a conversation...
Most men are.
Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?... I'll cook tonight.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
What!
Oh my God... What did they do! My God!!!
You're all right... you sure...
Please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful time together... When we first met, you said this wasn't serious and I shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets. None. And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me... I want the truth. If you're seein'somebody else, let me know... You don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me. Just tell me the truth.
Oh sure... Gotta believe in God. But I don't think God made man in his own image. No.'Cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men. No, I think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of God because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting I slept with a few saints and let me tell you... Booooorring!!!... And so the whole point of life, I think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and, ya know work it out...... Not that we have to get married.
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit. Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home.
Lydia?! Lydia who!?
You're calling Lydia in my office. You must think I'm some dope. You fuckin'bastard... You...... stay out all night long...
... I don't get a friggin'phone call. You stroll in here at noon. I got... two people out sick. Ya think I need this? I Do Not Need This!
He's not a moron.
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
I... You're not going to understand this.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
See, I told you!
I thought... if... if I can help him in some way... you know?... get him this girl he loves... Then... maybe.... things'll start changing for me... My luck, ya know... Maybe... Forget it... It's a stupid idea.
Nothing it's just... I begining to understand you.
You were great. Thanks alot.
You're kidding! What did he say?
Whoah! Oh, honey, that's terrific!
Ya know, I'm thinkin'with another income coming in, I would love to get a bigger place.
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
No... it's just...
Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
No.
Bullshit! If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
Oh yeah? What did I get? What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week? You think your company is such a treat? Your moods, your... " pain ", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
Terrific. Going on alot of dates... seeing lots of men... lots of dates..
Yeah so? The guy's beat up he... he probably has a concussion or something, right? He'll snap out of it?
But.. How could that happen?
What if I was a relative?
Yeah, Edwin, sure... and Pinnochio is a true story... Edwin! Wake up! This is a fairytale...
She likes me. She said for me to call!
I tell him no visitors!!!
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
He and his wife was were at some bar.. and some nut came in with a shotgun and blew the place apart. She was a beautiful girl... She never knew what hit her.
He's not here.
A real nice place I know... Ah... can't get there! Not tonight.
No... no... we can't... we can't..
Venice... Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME...... Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn...
Come on now... You can't sit here.
Leave me alone... I wanna go...
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood. It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
Good. You believe this drunk?
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body. Do you know what that means? What this could lead to?
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran. Want some?
How un sixties of you.
I used to think my biography would be JACK LUCAS THE FACE BEHIND THE VOICE, but now it can be JACK LUCAS, THE FACE " AND " THE VOICE... or maybe just JACK EXCLAMATION POINT...
Huh huh.
Which ones?
A list.
Well there.... What's the difference?
You get a VCR with the membership.... For a short time until you get your own. Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out. See if you're interested.
No! I told you! You won a contest!
Free?
Well, since you're a member, we could...
If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh.
No... thanks... Listen
Hi... Where are my shoes?
Where?
What?!
They said you're The One.
Oh shut up!!!
Take a guess... Let him guess!! Tch.
A quest?
The Little...
Him...?
Listen... I don't mean to be flippant or to enrage you or anything but... you're an imbecile. And I'm not The One... I'm not any One...
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
Parry.
I know...
What's her name?
No.. I have to get back to work. Take care of yourself.
I don't know. But I gave it to you... to help YOU... not him.
O. K... let me explain this one more time... The Holly Grail is in....
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were a frat initiation? I don't think so... There has to be a Grail.
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
Tch. You are so sweet... Now I know why you're saying this.... You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
I LOVE THIS MAN... YA HEAR ME JADED CITY...... I'M DAFFY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!!!
I'm not. Believe me. I'm scum.
I'm self centered, I'm weak I don't have the will power of a fly on shit...
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me... You know none of this is true PARRY the Grail, the voices... Jack... There's a part of you that Come on... what are knows this isn't true. saying... I know who you are... I know who you are.. or who you were. You're acting really You don't belong on the No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent Jack... man.... you're a teacher... Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?...
The Red...? You're totally gone, aren't you?
Well, maybe he wants to stay here. Do... do you want to stay here?
Yes. I think that's very fair.
NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it... this is nuts. This is too nuts... I'm leaving. I mean it!
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth... And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, " You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men "... But the boy was overcome... Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power... Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of... radical amazement... he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...... And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames... leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved... Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value... He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail. Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him. He was a simple minded man... not particularly skilled... or admired... He tells the King some jokes... sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse... Finally, the fool says, " What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help? "... And the King says, " I need a sip of water to cool my throat "... So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King... Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him... an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along... And the King asks, " How can this be?... how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find "? And the fool answers, " I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty. "... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man not because he was touched by God's glory... but rather, by the compassion of a fool.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Happily married, probably.
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
In a bar called Hellfire.
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or.. stay together.
I'm still scared.
Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish... now begone... before somebody drops a house on you!...
Fuck you.
You're out numbered son.
Oh... like Moses.
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's " The Purple Bread, " an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery. In subtitles.
Well, we have plenty of those. Right over here. We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
Yeah.
Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
Don't say that.
Well, it's enough for me.
I never say anything I have to.
What are we about to do?
I don't drink coffee...
I don't drink coffee...
Well, no wonder. We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...... I'm not coming up to your apartment. That was never my idea.
Oh no, I want to. I've got a hard on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night. I have a confession to make?
No.
No, I...
Will you stop!...... I'm in love with you...
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
Yeah,'cause she's so " twinky "...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig,'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
No.
Well, lemme sing the one I picked an'see what you think... " When there's a fire in your heart / Break the glass / Sound the alarm... "
Now, now.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
I did, didn'I, El?
You just going to sit there?
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
I'm going on over there...
I know you're not.
I'm sorry.
Now, hand...
Sssh, come on now... Be a good girl.
I'm not going to get up an'leave you. Now let's go over to El's an'have a good time.
" You'll be burned out / Or smoked out / An'come back to me, I know... "
I'magine it's me then, id'n it?
You're depressed that I come along.
Well, is that a happy face I see?
Bobby, don't talk like that...
Sure...
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Just finish eating.
No, let's go...
You got any change?
Seven hundred dollars, down the toilet! I'd like to go back and punch the son of a bitch out! Can you give us a lift?
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
Alaska.
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
Who? People, that's who! Pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. They're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.
No, but it was very clever... I would of just punched her out.
Five'll do it.
No. We have tomatoes.
Only what's on the menu... A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
I'll come back when you've made up your mind...
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
You want me to hold the chicken.
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
I always tell everyone the same thing. I got rolled and beat up real bad recently, and since then it's two for one, an'I work strictly in tandem with Betty...
No, I'm not... I'm not.
Thank you... Oh no, don't put it on there...
Oh.
No.
No kidding.
I have to talk seriously with you...
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
Catherine she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on his way to the post office in La Roche... and he ran into a Jeep and sprained his neck...
Robert, I have to tell you something...
Daddy's very ill.
He's had two strokes.
No...
Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
All right...
It's not that bad.
A week or two isn't going to ruin your life, for Godsakes.
We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
Sometimes.
Sort of.
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
Like what?
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
With applesauce?
I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
I don't know where she is!
You were going without saying goodbye?
But what about me?
And you no longer play at all?
Yes, intentionally.
Swimming?
Why?
Nothing.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Tomorrow's a full practice day... But the day after is kind of open.
If you're free.
You don't call that music, though.
I was really very moved by the way you...
Why?
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
You had no inner feeling?
Then I must have been supplying it.
What?
No, it isn't what I think.
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
Some bath oil?
I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
I don't believe vou.
Something witty and devastating like that.
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
Yes.
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
I have to talk to you.
Yes, it is!
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
What?! I can't hear you!
Please, I'll see you later this evening.
I'm trying to be delicate with you, but you're not understanding me. It's not just because of Carl, or my music, but because of you... I mean, what would it come to? If a person has no love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his friends, something... How can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should he ask for it?
That'll make you happy.
It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around...... like this...
Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
I thought you had to go to the mainland today. Aren't you going to miss the ferry?
I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
Not at all.
Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once, that Bobby give me...
I don't think that's true.
Besides being very rude.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, " What for? " Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that...
No, I wouldn't.
Well, I should hope not...
Bullshit! Truck drivers know the best eating places on the road.
Don't call me " mack, " honey.
You better hold onto your tongue!
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
Yeah, it could be adorable...
Right, steam. A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote them a note once, and told them to clean it... I mean, don't you see that? It's just filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a stink! I don't even want to talk about it...
Pardon me?
I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
Perhaps...
Fine.
What?
Not now, I'm busy
Hurry up, you're wastin'my time, what the fuck.
For once in your life have some respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
Alright.
What?
Remember me, from the pool?
What are you doin'here?
You know somebody around here?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
So what's her name?
A play ya.
Me? No. Don't want none either. Such bastards, man.
That's it?
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
How you treat them?
Well, you know I'm standin'here and you say I look good?
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Oh,'cause you got it like dat?
Yo, can I talk to you for a minute?
Fa what?
Wha'?
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
I'll be right down.
These are the pretty girls you told me to come down for?
Where you goin'?
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar'own neighborhood for?
Man, if I go down you're goin'down with me.
No, Baruch.
You know, Eddie's cousin.
I think she lives down by Pitt.
I think by Twenty two.
What you want with her anyway '
A bad attitude.
You said before, that he got boxes?
I think he's 18 or 17.
Um, yeah I think so.
Okay, then dance. Show.
You here to see somebody?
Who?
What she look like?
Yo, that's my girl.
I suggest you turn around and go back to where you came from.
You sure?
My friend told me she lived around here.
Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
How do I know you're not lying.
Probably. One of the many.
Nothing.
Hey!
You live around here?
You gotta girLfrLend?
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
God I admire you.
Comanche Indian.
Would you like me to change anything?
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
What?
Oh, thanks.
That's what he said.
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Wonder who his supplier is.
I wasn't asking.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
Creasy, how old are you?
You're not taking real good care of yourself.
You don't have to run with me, Crease.
What? What are you talking about?
You're lucky.
Fletch.
Fletch F. Fletch
I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe?
' Your men'might just be involved in all this.
I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.
Ask anybody.
That a boy.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Two bs?
That's two.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
No children?
Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
Mrs. Smith.
Right.
Margaret.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden. You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Oh really, there's no need to we don't want to do that...
Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
No idea at all?
Like when?
For sure?
I think I  d rather have drugs.
Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens things up around here, don  t you?
My pleasure.
What, the heat here?
The two surfer boys?
Thought so. What for?
You gonna nail the chief?
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
You find the source?
Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
I agree.
Are you serious?
Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
Till then.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Right.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Okay. Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Then he has.
Of course they are.
Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around. Don't go back in there.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
It  s okay. The cops did it.
They busted me last week.
I know. I got bad luck or something.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
Cops are here. I can smell them. They're after me. Lie down, Gum.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
Sure you did.
Twenty years.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
That's Brazil.
Wait here for me, Gummy.
Because we can't.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you. One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
Alan Stanwyk.
Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.
I want you to murder me.
Why don't you try suicide?
So why pick me?
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
I have the same problem with my help.
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
It'll be a first class ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
That's right.
What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service.
Only if you promise not to return me.
' Magic'today, huh?
Shoot.
Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away.
' Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding. '
Spot right here.
Maybe.
Only one way to find out.
That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.
I just thought... sure. Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
His bride. Cute as a button.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
How about Marvin's sixty fifth birthday party?
They just left, sir.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
Very good sir.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
One.
I would, actually.
Right. Tell you what have you caviar?
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
Muchas gracias.
No wonder.
I commend him on his choice.
I commend him on his choice
Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.
She moved out?
So you're saying she moved out.
This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
Tell the cops.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
' Uh, almost'is not an answer.'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
I never read the paper.
Looks great.
Practically.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
Who?
How gray?
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
You're onto something. That's good. What?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
I have some ideas.
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
You'll have it.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
Print this Frank.
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy.
Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.
Forget it.
Not really.
I was upset.
Fletch.
Yeah.
Who's Frieda?
No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
I ain't got you.
Please.
I don't know, I never met your father.
Some fag. Charged me up the ass.
Poor taste. I know. Listen, I respect homosexuals. When I was young, my maid was a homosexual. My maid was a homosexual.
Zuzu Petals. You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L. A.
Let's see, you're her worried sister. Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten foot pole.
Actually, you may take it all now.
I have no answers. Thanks for the stain. Find the girl. In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler. We'll chat again, then.
Nuthin'.
Uh, let's go sit down.
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case. Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
They did one of these about my ex wife. It's called'The Nutcracker.'' The Nut crack er'... I don't need money. I need some questions answered.
Question one: Can I have some money? Kidding. Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny? You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who? What? Where? How? Now.
Zuzu Petals! Did she have it?
Did she tell you anything?
Drink your cappucino, you're giving me a headache...
Hold that thought. Are we being shot at?
I'm not cynical. Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now. Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
All your friends call you Jazz.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole. Before they make Crocodile Dundee three.
You're saying you need money.
Quit crying. I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...
Cool. Jazz, meet me at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion tonight. I'll have a ticket for you at the door. Some concert. Could be interesting. Dress nice.
This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...
A fucking C. D. Wow, this case is closed. So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
I wish I knew. You did good work...
I'm sorry, that dress. What do you say we...
I like.
Then I guess her case is closed. Mine isn't. I want to know why everybody wants Zuzu. Why people are killing and dying for her.
Hello... It's Colleen. With answers. She wants to meet. Down. Way down town. Late.
Who?
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it. What do they make?
Without Grendel knowing about it. B I N G O and Bingo was his name O. Counterfeit C. D. s. Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
Wha
Uh... wha? You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask'em. I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D. J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
What? Jesus, tell me!
Because I know rock n roll.
Come again? B. FL. D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U. C. L. A.
He's the lamest clue I've ever had in my life. Here's our stop...
You didn't ask. Have you ever thought about mousse?
What a perv...
Who cares about people?
Are you okay?
Reality reality reality Outrageous building, huh?
Why have you come to my planet?
This is fucking unbelievable. Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...
Forget it.
Who cares? I got a case.
I've got a clue. Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.
I don't need it that bad.
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits. I think Armani. They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that. I kicked their ass! Well, I tried. There were two of them you know...
Where's my father? Have you even looked?
Liar! You don't care! About anything.
Yeah, go on...
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk. Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist archeologist dentist kind of thing... he's real busy.
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Two words. Disco Express.
' Booty Time. '
Like me.
' It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U. S. A. It's booty time... '
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody. Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you. You look at this picture and all you see is beauty. I see the beast.
Case closed, okay? Thirty seconds.
What's fine?
Off what? Twenty seconds...
Oh. One more thing. This is personal. I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
Say cheese...
Okay.'B y e!
The point?
Anyway you want it, asshole.
Why thank you. It's a Christmas present. That was my sense of humor, everyone. I wish you would fake a laugh. It's easy with a deaf person.
I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Don't play games... ugh. Did you say you don't have the third... ugh. I'm not going to torture you, Ford.
Ah, I didn't say seven P. M., now did I?
What about Don?
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music. Those ingrates really take a bite. But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C. D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
That's cute. You're funny.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O. D.'d, right? Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
Friendship's a lot different out here. A wrong number is a relationship. But then this isn't a social call.
' Bye, Johnny...
Just find her, man. She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week. Do whatever you want with my words. And my money.
I hope you solve the case and I know you will, because you're the best. Ford, guys like you don't grow on trees.
What?
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
You don't use shit?
Cause if I do.
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
I got a name Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
B. O. C. A.
Got a wife named Angie.
What?
Who brings it?
This side.
Takin'care o'business it's after midnight.
Well try, okay?
Sal
Don't forget anchovies.
Did they follow you?
Henri... I need one more favor from you. I know I am imposing...
Not quite you are in it whether you like it or not. The police know you brought the car into the country. This makes you an accomplice.
... Salvatore?...
Look, I'll level with you I need a little more time I got to shift gears.
Hell no my end is covered my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
It's your problem.
Si tu veux.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Comment va t elle?
That's a relief.
Il est en retard.
Une erreur! C'est g  nial. C'est une vedette  la t  l  vision. Il peut aller partout sans  tre soup  onn ... En plus il a besoin de fric.
Sois gentil avec lui. On ne sait jamais. Il peut te faire travailler  la t  l  vision.
We must follow it.
Mmmmm. That bastard who followed me on the subway, he's the eager one.
Who financed it?
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch. Like a bowstring. It was built from both ends. With no support in the middle. Beautiful.
Get up on the bar and show me how you work. If I like it you don't have to go in.
They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted valise broads you run with.
Why not?
Yeah!
Where the hell do you think it is, potato head?
Yeah. In the late innings. Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
When ya go back on?
Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours. The kid comes in at six will wake ya. A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin'a dog around the joint.
Case? So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
Tumble it. One end to the other.
Never trust a nigger.
Whip it out.
What about the last of the big time spenders. You make him?
He probably sells insurance. Owns a chicken farm in Hackensack.
The greaser with the blonde.
Come on just for fun
Toy wit'this will ya.
Makin'wine in the basement. He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
We're goin'now! Goodbye.
It's Cloudy. Open the door.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Pass.
Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and burned.
The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast. Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here.
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
It was a crematorium.
For dead bodies.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin'all over you like flies.
He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash. He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business.
Yeah.
What are you saying?
No, I don't.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl. You went to Saint Xavier with Mary. You lived five blocks from her. You liked her. But she ain't interested. That must've hurt, huh?
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North. You mind I take a shot at him?
They around?
Where's the collar, in the cells?
I'll go find Hayes.
The game, Graham. The Series?
I seem nervous, huh?
I should'a been a fucking mailman.
One way to find out.
I think I ruined the sauce... again.
I'd go with you and Chinese take out over her any time.
He did.
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank... long as you get there.
You give him his drops?
Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
Do you know how much I love you?
I've been talking to this... guy... this cop... on the HAM... and, uh, he...
I've been talking to Johnny... on the radio.
No. Not our Johnny. I mean, it's Johnny... but not now... in the future.
So am I.
Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy...
No, I don't.
About what?
I wanna be wrong here. But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
You can talk to Julia. Forget the radio.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Satch, would you listen to me here. Just you and me. Can I talk to you here, alone?
Are you listening to me? You're in a world of shit. An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment. We got your prints all over the place. Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank. You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3 0. And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run. Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th. The Mets are gonna win 5 3. Go watch the game, Satch.
Frank. We know. We know it's Shepard.
Get him home safe.
Glad to hear that.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
C'mon, Chief, show some guts.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
I'm right here behind you...
Name's John.
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license. Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
Whatta ya know. Bayside, born and raised.
15 band closes down at night. During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
What?
Fed up? Lemme tell you something, in a 1000 years, when school kids study America, they're gonna learn about three things: the Constitution, Rock'n'Roll, and Baseball.
I been Q ing you all night. How the hell did you do it?
The World Series. You called Buford's homer.
What are you talking about? I'm talking about this afternoon.
Oh, that was my kid.
What'd you say your name was?
Is this some kind of joke? Gordo is that you? Are you fucking with me?
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the'69 Series... live?
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
29 years ago.
I'm not dreaming.
You just burned the desk.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
Thirty five? That would make it...
Nah, I gave it up.
No wait, don't go!
But you're not... you're not still here.
What?
Why?
On the job?
That can't be... that's not gonna happen.
When?
Yeah, it's me.
It's hard to explain. Something happened today. It was like a dream. And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times. Times we never had before.
What it was like when you died in the fire...
Are you alright "?
What? Johnny, what's wrong?
What? What is it?
Whatta you mean she's not here?
She just died, your mother just died?
Jesus Christ... that's... ten days from now. How?
What kinda twisted animal.
Whatta you mean...
What are you talking about?
I gotta take her away, John. I'm gonna take your mother away. He can't hurt her if I take her away.
I'll warn them.
What can we do? You don't even know who this guy is.
So what should I do? Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
I don't know, John. I'm a fire fighter. This is... this is different.
Then you get Mom the hell out. But Dad, those other women weren't supposed to die. We don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives.
No. I just kept talking to her. There was a lot of guys in that bar could'a been any of'em.
Whatta we do now?
How?
All right, I'm with you. I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
What are we like in... 1998?
Hey, what about the Amazin's? They pull it off?
Yeah, you betcha.
Wow.
You all right?
Don't worry, Chief. I'm not gonna let anything happen to her... no matter what.
Yes it is... we did this. We changed everything. I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die... in the fire. I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
I don't think I can. I'm not a cop. I can't. I can't stop this guy.
Johnny, I know, but...
What?
He took your wallet?
He touched your wallet! Where's your wallet?
We got him! Dad you got him!
His prints. You've got his prints. I'll run them through criminal index. You gotta get me that wallet.
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Please, Dad, just do it.
Huh?
Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder. John...
I don't remember. Why don't I remember?
Go in where?
I know pal. I remember. Twenty nine years tomorrow.
What?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Cancer. It was the cigarettes. Right? The cigarettes?
How'd you know my name, mister?
You got a deal, mister. I mean Santa.
Nothing you're willing to do.
And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys. I don't need'em. What I need is a partner I can count on. I care about you. Not cause of me and your old man. Not cause of your mom. But because of you.
What're you talking'? You know better than anybody, John. You've read this file a thousand times.
Which means he probably knew her.
Not the first time that's been true. I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy. This is the guy, Satch.
What?
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Fine. You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
Close.
I know. I'm sorry. Work.
Look who's talking.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
Are you a good cop, John?
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
I'm sorry. I didn't realize... But she knew, John. A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
Oh. Sorry. How so?
I look familiar?
Nah, just working the job.
As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day... one of the Nightingale murders.
Sullivan?
Fuck you, asshole.
Going? How do you mean?
Drop me off? How do you mean?
That's an eyeball! Oh, God!
Same thing.
I did?! I broke the world's record.
I didn't mean it the way it sounded...
We'd be all alone. We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
Not now. I'm cold.
I know how to do it. I mean, how do we do it in the hammock?
I vote for the hammock.
You're too clean for me.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin'down there either.
It's Friday the 13th.
Don't do that to me!
Be a man, man.
A hammock?
You can say... " Hello, how are you? "... for starters.
I don't know.
Just slow down. Let me get to know you again. Let me get to know this place again.
Nothing.
No. I got here just before you did.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
What do you mean?
And, what about us?
I don't know. I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us. How do I break through?
After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year. No one would tell me anything. All I know is what the police told me. We have nowhere to go unless you let me in. What happened?
I'm sorry.
In that little thing?
Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
Not us! He's really creepy.
Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...
Gulp!
Stop worrying. I don't think they'll bother to come after us.
You're the boss.
You don't " have to. "
I do like you. But not when you act like a jerk.
I never said you were " nothing ".
You're wrong.
My friggin'stepfather and asshole in residence.
What? Who pulled it out?!
You admit the sign did say " Camp Forest Green, " with an arrow pointing this way.
Why? Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
Just drive. He'll get out of our way.
But that's no what worries me the most... It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
Better call an ambulance first.
Whaddya mean?
See any paint?...... Sorry, guys, I did in Mr. Commando. Survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine.
Of course not. If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota. Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
Yeah, that's fat too.
How do you know? Did you take his temperature?
I thought Jason was only a legend?
And make sure my daughter stays put...... She's grounded.
I already have a very good idea what could've happened...... Megan, Jason is out there. He has to be stopped. I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area. He'll keep killing until...
Then let's get goin'. We can argue on the way. You tell me what you need...... I'll make sure you get in.
Why?
I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta finish what I started.
Lake Forest Green?
Yes. And I said, hand me those padlocks.
Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember? This is Sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?...
Well, grown ups think it's funny to be scared.
That's debatable.
Shhh... You know what I used to do when I was a little girl when I got scared?
Which is?
You gotta be kidding!
Why not? I used to play it alone. I love murder games. Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
Of course not. She probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it. I still don't get it. Why him? I mean, he's cute alright, but...
He didn't say anything?
Don't piss me off, junior. Or I will repaint this office with your brains.
Tommy Jarvis. We gotta do something. He's even more powerful now that...
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
Please, Sheriff. You'll see we dug it up.
Eight times.
But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
I understand. However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
No. Not here. Come by my house tonight at eleven. Don't be late.
Save your...
I'm scared. I'm very scared.
I'm kind of busy right now...
Jason Voorhees is dead.
You food'll be right out.
Look
Look, I don't want your money!
You need to leave.
That's it, we're done.
Legs giving you trouble?
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
It's... It's all right.
So's he and he knows it.
Good night, beautiful.
Get up!
Goddamnit!
That's very colorful, chief.
Tell me.
Tell me!
She's yours?
Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was like, having strippers delivered to church Bingos and shit.
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
Is this Anthony?... Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony did you fuck my dog?
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Listen, since I got you on the phone ask the guys there if they wanna chip in for a hooker. I'll send her right over. Her name is Vicki.
Randy, c'mon!
Gotta go. See you guys later.
Are you crazy?!
Don't do anything stupid.
I'm gonna get your outta this. Just hang tight. Okay?
I've told you the truth.
I know what it sounds like.
I didn't kill her!
She asked me to come over. She said she had something to tell me.
About Jessica.
Look, I know I treated her bad
Miscarriage?! Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
Oh, you stupid, sorry son of a bitch...
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
I'm sorry to hear that. A famous man once said there is no worse regret then a temptation resisted.
I'm literally going to kill you!
A pizza?!
Jason... Voorhees?
But she might be in trouble...
I don't care about being hip anymore.
I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us... especially with this.
More or less. It's part of my college fund.
Improvise, of course.
My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit. He might even pay some attention to me.
You're joking, right?
It's not that, it's just that... It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
I guess not.
Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
Time to check out the waiters.
But... wait a minute!
Tell me.
Right.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
What?? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose??
Not another word, do you hear me??
Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
Why are you doing this to yourself?
I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?
But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
This isn't a request.
You can and you will!!
I heard you weren't coming.
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
What about you?
The bow... front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them
But Rennie...
I opened thousands of brains.
Big mess every time.
Crosstown.
Ruptured steam pipe.
Do not inhale.
I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at the wheel.
Elliot?
Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent.
Quietly effective.
Ride with me. We need a haircut.
Don't talk like that.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
But didn't we know it would happen?
Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?
We must abandon.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
Tonight. What's tonight?
You mean because What's His Name.
It's just a review.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
What happened eighteen months ago?
And he was there?
That's awful.
A year and a half later? You're still brooding?
I said,  I'm dead'. He killed me.
I think we Nought to wait.
You say we go?
I'm not ready.
What about the haircut?
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
He'll hate it.
What?
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
How do you Eknow.
What do you mean?
Had to be him.
Classic.
What are we talking about?
You're not making sense. Make sense.
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?
This could be it.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
What about her?
She died.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
What?
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
It can't be all that personal.
We're able to surprise each other.
Because we're completely mismatched.
It's your best play, Nicky.
He will absolutely hate it.
Do you want to get some coffee?
What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
Is it?
She's doing like those Iranians.  I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee '
I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
Oh please. Not now. She wants you to stop seeing What's Her Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
She is kicking you out.
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
Opening night?
I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.
Brilliantly moving.
What else?
This building is not secure.
What do we want?
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
See, Daddy.
What else?
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
I want to be fair minded, Nicky.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
And you've been extremely patient.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
I had an affair are you sure you want to hear this?
Alma Wetzel.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
I feel great. I feel impeccably alive. I'm elated. Eat something. Please. I love you.
One more out.
A thousand things.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Where the hell are you?
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
Lillian says it once a week.  Why doesn't he come live with us? '
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Let's not start that again.
Where's your elastic brace?
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.
What do you want me to do?
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Matthew, look at him. When I lived in Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten movie stars. Where's your white Lincoln limo?
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
How come you got the kid with you?
A grandmother. God bless you.
It's the kid's lucky day.
Now that's a complicated subject.
Look, we're stuck here front and back. It's dinnertime for you, game time for me. Let's park the cab and go to Mannion's. What do you say, Matthew? We'll drink beer and talk baseball.
You're charming the boy.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down.
Then say it.
Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
He used to love losers. But the laws of physics changed.
Because life is good.
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
They're my team.
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.
What about my play?
Appreciate that, Sidney. But our leading man can't remember his lines. And his understudy can't carry the play.
So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
Postpone. We have every right.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
Why?
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, Peter.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high lighted with a felt tip pen.
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
Mine was cobalt blue.
Yes.
Yes.
There was a review.
So does Elliot.
Oh. You know him.
And he has finer moments now and then.
Endearing.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
Say it again.
You know what.
One more time.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
So do I. Over and over.
Would you like to meet him?
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
Is it true?
He wears a disguise.
But you're his friend.
He's a very sweet man.
Home.
No one's waiting.
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
Never mind.
Yes.
But you're here. So you must have come to me.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
I don't want you, Steven.
Yes I can't talk like this.
It is the work of untouchables.
I am your wife.
I I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter. I'm my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India I've read a great deal about you.
Not anymore. At first I was amazed... but when you are fighting in a just cause, people seem to pop up like you right out of the pavement. Even when it is dangerous or
I am. But I'm not so egotistical as to think He plans His day around my dilemmas.
Oh, I've been a Gandhi buff for a long time.
What was he like?
Well, he must've found some of the answers...
No neither do I. But... but this man is a Christian and he has written
Well, I don't know how you got a ticket for
I've never spoken for anything else.
Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
Wait and see... wait and see...
I don't know... I'm still searching for a " response. "
There are unjust laws as there are unjust men.
Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
I've traveled so far and thought so much. As you can see, my city was a sea city always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians. The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped.
I would rather march.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
I I will write to the press here and in England. And I will use the courts.
So did I.
The fools! Sorry...
Well, that's one victory.
Ahh.
All right. Fine.
Oh! Neither have I. I'm awfully sorry.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
God, even you want to tell me what I can't do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing. But you did, once.
Who are you trying to convince?
No? What's keeping you?
I guess so. Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
I'll take care of it.
Hello, sweatheart. Come on up.
It's about the Director.
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
You have more in common than you know.
He's too tall.
Suit yourself.
German.
What about this?
Noone orders southpaws anymore.
God, what wouldn't you do to leave the planet?
God, you're serious, aren't you?
You wish.
This calls for a celebration. Doesn't it?
So what? You didn't kill him, did you?
You're going to have to earn your supper. I've got my final physical tomorrow.
What is that one?
A day or so.
You know I wasn't drunk I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car
I walked right in front of it. I was never more sober in my life.
We can't stay here.
They think I offed the Director.
Where?
Could be worse. They could have found it in your eye.
You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again. We should cut our losses.
They'll recognize me.
Is that all?
If you say so. The stripe.
Never stopped you before. And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
You are a catch. No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to " breed up ". What's wrong with her?
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
She doesn't have to know. She doesn't want to know.
Again?
I'm sure you'll be very convincing.
Will you be okay?
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, " How are you? " Forty five minutes later I reply, " Not bad. How are you? "
I was never very good at it, remember?
How the hell did you get here.
No, but you might need them when you get back.
Where are you going?
Vincent, come down. I've found him.
No problem. Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors
It happened in Australasia. He checked in yesterday. No family complications, no record he ever broke his neck. As far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully productive member of society. You just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life. Excuse me, your life.
Why are you inventing problems? You two are a couple of goddam clones. You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
There's a way.
Last night? I was at home.
Were you alone?
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
Why don't we say we were together?
I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
I know about you.
It was a mercy killing after all.
Where?
Does it have a name?
You're angry
I don't think so. The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun on this satellite right here.
Nothing yet. I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late fifties. But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
Who are they?
My medication. I left it back there.
So you're not so smart after all. I want you to know if it ever came to it I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank. In fact, I'd rather use a donor egg if it came to it.
You hypocrite. Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are what you are? Don't you get any satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome? He's a big fan of yours. He wants to apply here.
I told you, the government pays. It's all taken care of.
Honey, you've made one mistake
Honey, look around you. The world doesn't want one like that one.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.
I'll take care of my end.
News said two persons killed.
That's right.
That's your problem.
No way. I always do my own work.
No applause!
What do you add up to here?
A little more was taken out before. My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
The obvious. But we are both not interested in that right now.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
You okay?
Sure...
Where do you want to go?
I've been there every day for the last four years.
Just like old times?
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
Where did you get them developed?
Good.
What do you want for dinner?
How's Estelle?
Boring.
That's not all of it.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
It's just been a while.
Really?
I bought you a lot of new things.
You got the parole, didn't you?
Yeah... I know.
That doesn't hurt.
I didn't. I just waited.
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
Should be light traffic that time of day... the Bank Guard carries a. 38. These will stop an M. 2 at fifty yards.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
It doesn! t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
I mean it.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
... and live happily ever after.
Why?
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
Do it my way.
Let's send his cut back Just keep going.
I don't want to go there.
Yeah.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
Who's she?
If you don't start telling the truth...
We keep going.
He must have.
Sure?
Texas is a big state.
I'll bet you can.
What do you want to do?
Do you mean that?
When they find it, they find it.
Like what?
I didn't mean police.
I did I killed a man.
Listen to me. It's hard enough.
We got this far.
I guess you're right.
No more about Beynon.
Things can't get much worse can they?
Can we make it?
That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A. M.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Whatever you say.
So what?
Just get your clothes on...
I don't know, airport I guess.
Yeah.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
I guess we are.
No, I'm not.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
I never have any luck.
Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
That little job cost me a hundred dollars... didn't even get to keep the fish.
By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister.
All right. Shells?
Gonna knock down a wall?
Chicago.
Yeah. I got out.
Suit yourself.
Two.
Chambers Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
One inch stuff on a three number combination.
I'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
What do you have in mind?
Dillinger got killed.
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Right.
Then you do it.
Where we go in1?
Why not?
Don't you want to go to the airport?
Come on. How much?
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
Sure am.
That's what I want.
You got it.
Go with God.
That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...
You can trust him...
Two years.
That's what matters, isn't it?
I got a nurse in mind.
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
I know. I know.
Yes.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
A couple of weeks back.
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
What did you do? Albert?
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
What did he say?
What's it got to do with you?
Oh ay?
Well, he drove it into the river.
How'd it happen, then?
Was he?
Well?
I made a mistake.
Never mind.
Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming, It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother? I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back, You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother, One of my lads gets a bit over anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs. So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit, So I'm worried. I can't fight them  I haven't that kind of set up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear. Kinnear did it.
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
I don't know. That's all I was told.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say so? Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Confidential, like.
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
Yes you can.
Brumby!
Address?
What about?
No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know.
I want to talk to you later.
Tomorrow morning, then?
Nothing more? Just another feller?
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Though nicer than most?
Why'd you see him so regular?
I call that regular.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
What was bugging Frank?
I don't know nothing.
You know Sid Fletcher?
Do you?
Sid Fletcher.
Yes.
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
Yes, while he was here.
He was here for four days.
Could you do me a favour?
Could you please put my glass on the table?
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
And what was that?
Is he coming here?
What kind of entertaining?
You sure about that?
Tell me about the girl.
The young girl. Who pulled her?
Was it Albert?
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Who set it up? Eric?
Then he must have pulled her.
Did my brother Frank find out?
And you didn't know her last name?
Well, it's Carter. That's my name, And her father was my brother. And he was murdered last Sunday. Now get up and get dressed.
No. Frank was a good bloke.
Have another?
Thanks for coming.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
Oh, what you doing now?
That must be interesting.
You coming to South America?
Where's that?
Nice family, are they? Church goers and all that?
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work. He was always on time.
At the Half Moon.
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
It just would. He was always the same.
Don't know.
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall. Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Where would I find him?
That's what he was saying about you.
Nowt.
Las Vegas.
Four of them.
Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea?
Ten to one, it belonged to Cliff Brumby, and like as not the bloody arcade as well. Right along the coast. Isn't that right, Thorpey?
No, I didn't, Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
I'm staying with a friend.
It's not like that, luv.
Will this do?
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
Is he staying the night?
It'll cost you.
You don't look it.
Don't come that bloody flannel with me. If you're a traveller, I'm bloody Twiggy. And who's he?
I'll call the police.
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
No.
And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?
What about Keith?
What you going to do?
You're a bastard.
You wouldn't.
' Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
Think about it.
Do you want breakfast?
Uh huh.
No. I'm not tired, Do you eat breakfast?
No chance of that.
They're friends of mine.
I don't want to get rough, do I?
Eric. Eric Paice.
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Funny, that.
Oh, that's nice.
Meaning what?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh, I'm straight. Respectable.
Oh, you've been watching television.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Good prospects for advancement, is there? A pension? Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like.
Yes, I retained that, Eric. Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
Cyril didn't like it, either.
He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in.
Scotch, please.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Nasty way to go.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
He said it'd be doing him a big favour.
What for? Protective purposes?
What? And get the clap?
That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?
Your hundred, and another hundred.
Three hundred altogether?
You're not seeing me?
Deadbeats all.
All of'em. They, hey: it happens to us all.
You missed a fucking sale. Big deal. A deadbeat Polack. Big deal. How you going to sell'em in the first place...? Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
You had to, yeah. Why?
To get on the board. Yeah. How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack? And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else. You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
You get those names come up, you ever get'em, " Patel? "
You ever get'em?
You did?
The whole fuckin'thing... The pressure's just too great. You're ab... you're absolu... they're too important. All of them. You go in the door. I... " I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch, " " or I don't win the Cadillac... " We fuckin'work too hard. You work too hard. We all, I remember when we were at Platt... huh? Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that... "
Well, they fucked it up.
They did.
We're stuck with this...
... this shit...
It is.
It's too...
You're on this...
I, I... I...
I...
That's right?
That's right?
... that's right...
No. That's absolutely right.
... that's right...
For some sales pro...
Yes.
Who?
No.
Yes.
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand if he paid two I'll eat my hat four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
He's doing very well.
The nurses?
You hear a lot of things... He's doing very well. He's doing very well.
River Oaks, Brook Farms. All of that shit. Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say " Good morning, " nothing... nothing...
Yes. It is. It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
Starting up.
Of doing the thing. The dif... the difference. Between me and Jerry Graff. Going to business for yourself. The hard part is... you know what it is?
Just the act.
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
That's the God's truth. And it gets me depressed. I swear that it does. At MY AGE. To see a goddamn: " Somebody wins the Cadillac this month. P. S. Two guys get fucked. "
You don't ax your sales force.
You...
You build it!
You fucking build it! Men come...
They have...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no. No. You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Someone should stand up and strike back.
Somebody...
Should do something to them.
Yes.
How? Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
That's what I'm saying. We were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the fuckin'leads out of the files... go to Jerry Graff.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
How do you know he'd buy them?
You haven't talked to him.
We're just " talking " about it.
As an idea.
We're not actually talking about it.
No.
As a " robbery "?! No.
Hey.
Did you?
Yes. I said, " Not actually. " The fuck you care, George? We're just talking...
You're actually talking about this?
Is that what I said?
What did he say? He'd buy them.
A buck a shot.
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw. Five thousand dollars. Split it half and half.
Yes. Twenty five hundred apiece. One night's work, and the job with Graff. Working the premium leads.
He'd give me a job.
What? What? The leads.
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown. After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch. After the contest.
You...
You.
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go. That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff. I can't go. I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much. I've got a big mouth. " The fucking leads " et cetera, blah blah blah "... the fucking tight ass company... "
What will they know? That I stole the leads? I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn. Why did I go to Graff? I got a better deal. Period. Let'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case.
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
Listen to this. I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why? The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me. Why? Because I probably did it. Are you going to turn me in? George? Are you going to turn me in?
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
They're going to come to everyone.
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you. Answer me. They come to you. You going to turn me in?
Are you sure?
Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight. That's something I have to do. If I'm not at the movies... if I'm not eating over at the inn... If you don't do this, then I have to come in here...
... I thought that we were only talking...
Me?
That's ridiculous.
I didn't ask to be.
Why? Why, because you only told me about it?
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand. Why are you doing this at all...?
In the abstract...
Why?
Do you need five grand?
You need money? Is that the...
What is the five grand? What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
I do?
If anyone's going, I could use some coffee.
I'm fine. You mean the board? You mean the board...?
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board. You. You see how... I... I can't... my mind must be in other places.'Cause I can't do any...
Yes.
Yes. They are old.
Clear...
Yes. I'm no fucking good.
Everything I... you know...
I am?
He said he filed...
They stole...
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
Were the leads insured?
Yeah.
A waste of time? Why?
The cops?
They aren't?
Why don't you think so?
Where were you?
Yes.
At home.
Yes.
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
You have nothing to hide.
Yeah. You know who doesn't?
Thieves.
They're inured to it.
Yes.
Will you excuse us please?
Did they catch...?
Oh, God, I hate this job.
That's great.
I didn't rob...
Did they get my contracts?
Would you excuse us, please...?
Moss... Who told him?
Are you talking to me?
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
You have a problem?
The people downtown said...
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin. I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on. You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
Anyone in this office lives on their wits... I'm going to be with you in a second. What you're hired for is to help us does that seem clear to you?
Would you come in here, please?
I will close.
Hey, I don't want to hear your fucking war stories...
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
Shit.
And did they steal the contracts...?
" You do get the opportunity... You get them. As I do, as anyone does... "
You bet your ass. Who wants to go to lunch? Who wants to go to lunch? I'm buying. Eighty two fucking grand. And twelve grand in commission. John. On fucking deadbeat magazine subscription leads.
Shelly...!
They...
Fuck her...
" Always be closing... "
Harriett...
Bullshit, you're... No. That's raw... well, if I did, then I'm glad I did. I, well. I locked on them. All on them, nothing on me. All my thoughts are on them. I'm holding the last thought that I spoke: " Now is the time. " They signed, Ricky. It was great. It was fucking great. It was like they wilted all at once. No gesture... nothing. Like together.
... yes...
That's right, Shel.
You're a client. I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms. I rub my head, throw me the cue " Kenilworth. "
Kenilw...
No... Black Creek. Yes. In Florida?
I wanted to speak with you about...
My wife told me to look into...
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex... But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted... I was at the Lingks'last... as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
" Home Cooking "... what did you call it, you said it... it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Home...
The monthly interview...?
Yes. Is this something that I can talk ab...
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France... the man's French, isn't he?
Ah. Ah, his wife is. Ray: what time do you have...?
Oh! My God... I've got to get you on the plane!
No. You said the one. That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
I'm sorry...?
Oh, God... Oh, God... Jim, excuse me... Ray, I told you, who he is is the senior vice president American Express. His family owns 32 per... Over the past years I've sold him... I can't tell you the dollar amount, but quite a lot of land. I promised five weeks ago that I'd go to the wife's birthday party in Kenilworth tonight. I have to go. You understand. They treat me like a member of the family, so I have to go.
Yeah.
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
Ricky...
Yes.
Yes.
I don't know. For me, I'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm. Some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. There was a sound she made... or, me, lying, in the, I'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me caf  au lait. She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete. Eh? What I'm saying, what is our life? It's looking forward or it's looking back. And that's our life. That's it. Where is the moment? And what is it that we're afraid of? Loss. What else? The bank closes. We get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed... the house burnt down... what of these happen...? None on'em. We worry anyway. What does this mean? I'm not secure. How can I be secure? Through amassing wealth beyond all measure? No. And what's beyond all measure? That's a sickness. That's a trap. There is no measure. Only greed. How can we act?
Well, let's have a couple more. My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
James. I'm glad to meet you. I'm glad to meet you, James. I want to show you something. It might mean nothing to you... and it might not.
Who did she call?
Why did she do that, Jim?
To... you know.
Of course you have three days.
Three business days. They mean three business days.
I don't understand.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday... in your three days. It's not a business day.
What would have elapsed?
When did you write the check?
What was yesterday?
And when was that check cashed?
What was the earliest it could have been cashed?
I just called downtown, and it's on their desk.
What is?
Tell me again.
I told you.
She wants her money back.
No. She told me " right now. "
She won't listen.
No, Jim.
I can't regotiate.
That...
What...?
What...? Say the words.
What power?
To negotiate what? To negotiate what?
What, " this "?
I can't talk to you, you met my wife, I...
Let's... no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
Forget the deal, Jimmy. Forget the deal... you know me. The deal's dead. Am I talking about the deal? That's over. Please. Let's talk about you. Come on. Come on. Come on, Jim. I want to tell you something. Your life is your own. You have a contract with your wife. You have certain things you do jointly, you have a bond there... and there are other things. Those things are yours. You needn't feel ashamed, you needn't feel that you're being untrue... or that she would abandon you if she knew. This is your life. Yes. Now I want to talk to you because you're obviously upset and that concerns me. Now let's go. Right now.
What did I tell you? What did I say about the three days...?
What are the police doing here...?
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map. Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Fuck you, Ricky. I ain't going out today. I'm going home. I'm going home because nothing's accomplished here... Anyone talks to this guy is...
Mountain View. Eight units.
You hear what I said?
Eight units. Mountain View.
When...
They took'em...
" Fuck the Machine "? " Fuck the Machine "? What is this. Courtesy class...? You're fucked, Rick are you fucking nuts? You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?! You want to...
Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust out humanitarian down on his luck lately. Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. " How much you just ingested, " what a big man you are, " Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum.
What is this, your farewell speech?
Your farewell to the troops?
Have a good trip.
Did you like your party?
Do you like them?
They were friends.
On your pillow.
I know. How long will you be gone?
Will you take me?
Why do you have to go?
I can help you.
Sit down. Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
Well, that's alright... alright. Good. You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right? You know... I never finished college. I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
What position did you occupy?
No. He would give it away. I know how to repay a consideration.
This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone.
What if we don't pay?
What can we do?
Then, after that, what? Joe'Little Knife'Pisani; Willie Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla himself, c'mon!
Yes, thank you.
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
Bought at the airport.
You go see your children first, and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else.
Merle, have you met my sister in law Deanna?
We're going to Europe next week. I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
Then why do you come to me?
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you. You have a house here, with us. You can live here with your kids... and you won't be deprived of anything. I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on. Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand. But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp... it would disappoint me.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama. He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?
I hated you for so long, Michael; for so many years. I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you would know and you would be hurt too. But I understand you now; I think I do. You were being strong for all of us, like Papa was. And I forgive you, and want to be close to you now. Can't you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet, and helpless without you.
Yeah, but I don't want him to see you.
He's the head of the family.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him'cause he's a man!
These Eye ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner. Don't be afraid to tell them. Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things. Let yourself be guided by him. He has more experience in these matters.
I understand...
You're a good fellow.
Ah, you're a sharp young fellow. How is it I've never noticed you before You're too quiet for your own interest. I could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable. No hard feelings, eh? If I can ever do you a service let me know. You've done a good job for yourself tonight.
Oh. Mikey, what's up? I'm totally in the dark.
Great, Havana's great. Lots of activity in Havana! Anybody I know here. Five Angels? Anybody?
I never met them.
No. No, I didn't. Who tells me anything? I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
That's what I'm here for.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
Me and you, great! Gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and we'll have these Washington suckers right where you want'em. Poor Frankie Five Angels. He always wanted to die in bed... with a broad.
Wait'll you see!
You? What do you mean you, I thought...
You? What do you mean you, I thought...
No. I mean, are you sure?
Me? NO, no, I don't know anything. Fellas! You're all falling asleep. We got to see Superman.
The song. Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent. They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President. When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women. I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that. It was Roth all along. He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing. I've already made my move.
The old man will never bring in the New Year.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
I know they get Pentangeli, that's all I know.
He said there was something good in it for me... me on my own.
Taken care of me. Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my. Did you ever think of that. Ever once? Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport. Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
It wasn't the way I wanted it! I can handle things. I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
A pig of a Neaponitan.
Beautiful.
For you, she is beautiful. For me, there is only my wife!
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
Nah. Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all. Make him look bad.
I wish they had. He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer. But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
Because he's what we say...  quot; connected  quot;... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue.
He took the money. Now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood, including Papa.
Roberto. Who owns the'rat holes. '
Within the compound will be fine.
That's off now.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat. But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
I don't know. I'm sorry, Kay...
That's not the way we look at it.
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings? He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo. He heard Connie.
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom. It's not your best side.
He's not the same as when I met him.
What the hell does that mean? Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life. I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.
I don't know. I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.
I can feel it in the way he talks to me.
It's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when I was Consigliere to Sonny.
Why didn't someone tell me!
Will you tell him?
Goddamn it, where were you?
Connie's outside.
No, I have confidence in their loyalty... but this is life and death, and Tom, you are my brother.
I don't think so. Unless I'm very wrong... they're already dead. Killed by someone inside... very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
If I'm wrong...
What was it, so I'll know.
I asked about Fredo?
I want you to reach Fredo. I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him. Assure him that there will be no reprisals. Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
They can come in now.
Alright.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
And Kay... she's all right?
Does she blame it on me? The baby?
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
I want it met.
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
I'm surprised at you, Tom. If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill... ANYBODY. But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there. Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
They are everywhere!
I know you do, Tom. Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do. If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
Good. Then you're staying.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
I'm going to the market.
Whose orders are these?
I'm sorry, Michael. Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left. Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
Does it feel like a boy?
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today. It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
Where?
Why don't you sit down?
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about. Things I've been thinking about changes I want to make.
Why too late?
His brother came to help him.
On a plane back to Sicily.
That's all. You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one. IF he was a traitor.
Kay, you've got it wrong. That kind of thing's all over, I promised you. This was between the two brothers. Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co wife. That was his joke, but he meant it. He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook. He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her. He set her up in a house in Jersey. She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life. She begged him to let her go. He did. He gave her money and made her give up the kids. Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.
Kay, I told you...
I won't let you leave! Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years. You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
We'll go back tonight. Bring the children.
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you. I will make changes; I can. I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
Where can we talk?
I represent the interests of the Corleone family. We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
You said you were Klingman.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
There are still things I have to do.
Alright. They bother me once in awhile. Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
No, I meant lose his family.
But times are different...
I like sporting events I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country. I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919... I heard you had some trouble.
What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns. It was my understanding we left all that behind. But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right. Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.
You're a considerate young man.
However I can help you...
We do favors for each other...
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Of course you must keep control of your family.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
Then you have to trace it. Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man. I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man. But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me. You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
Except the President of the United States.
Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.
Terrible. I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
Why... the Rosato Brothers.
Jake, Jake, come over here. Mike, I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he manages the casino for us.
So, that occurred to me.
Not good.
He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
He always makes money for his partners. One by one, our old friends are gone. Death, natural or not, prison, deported. Our friend in Miami is the only one left, because he always made money for his partners.
Okay. You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
No sign of them yet; but they're still on the Estate.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants. They're paying a higher rent.
Eh... Five dollars more.
What a terrible misunderstanding. Of course, Signora Colombo can stay in the flat. Who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal... when they pay such low rent.
In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!
Why is everybody giving me crap tonight?
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
Fuck you.
We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that! We are watching my fucking movie.
Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
If he were that famous, he probably wouldn't give me the time of day. This way, he's like my famous person. Yeah, my own personal famous person. Who treats me like I'm somebody worth talking to.
I wasn't going to try anything.
It's different. He's a man. And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
He's an artist. Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
It still hurt. A lot.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened. It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
Sure. I loved it.
You know, I just can't do that anymore. I still have time to get things right. Get married again
What are you then? What will you be ten years from now? Still cutting lawns? Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
Damn straight. I'm sick of playing games.
What're you talking about?
Yeah, I'm a good man. Something make you think I'm not?
Gimme a break. I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures. Is that going to hurt him?
You do that.
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go? Movie stars?
You mean family? All in Joplin, Missouri.
I'm not married.
Oh, I don't know. Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
You proposing what I think you're proposing? Don't you think I'm a little young for you?
Yeah? What's your husband do?
Then you're as single as I am.
You're sure of that?
Sins of the flesh? Everybody has those.
Yes! You know?
You did not know?
You and he are not doing things?
Good. That is what I hope. I did not think you a bugger too. I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
Yes. I trust you.
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
Maybe. But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't. He did it himself.
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy? Please, Clayton. It will be better if I find the body alone.
You are right. Yes. We must put him back.
My name is Whale. This is my house.
And your name is?
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo. That phrase? Death Before Dishonor. What does it mean?
The Marines. Good for you. You must have served in Korea.
The honest sweat of one's brow. I assure you I won't be offended. Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for two.
Splendid.
Excuse me, but are you famous?
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
They're just copies then. Gotcha.
Sure, everybody does. When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week. Why? Were you an actor or something?
Yeah? What were some of your movies?
Really?
Still. You must be rich. Making a couple of famous movies like those.
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
Nothing serious. A touch of stroke.
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
Sat for an artist. Been sketched.
You have the most architectural skull. And your nose. Very expressive.
But expressively broken. How did it happen?
You went to university?
Yes. You were a Marine.
Indeed. I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
What are you suggesting? You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone. I can assure you of that.
" Bride of Frankenstein. "
I'm sorry. It's too white, too distracting. Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
Pish posh, Mr. Boone. I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable... Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.
It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it? You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you.
It is. Only the poorest families ever ate it. We kept ours in a crockery jar.
Of course not. As I said, only poor people
I've spent most of my life outrunning my past. Now it's flooding all over me.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine. Every Englishman knows his place. And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you. My family had no doubts about who they were. But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature. I had imagination, cleverness, joy. Where did I get that? Certainly not from them.
I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.
Yes. An old, useless friend. You must excuse me, Mr. Boone. This is a world I finished with long ago. I pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment. Lunch should be ready. Shall we?
I liked it. We all did.
No.
Why? Was it supposed to be funny?
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
Quite true. Hand to hand combat is the true test. Did you ever slay anyone hand to hand?
Yes, I believe you could. How free is your schedule this afternoon?
What is we say phooey to the hedges? Could you spare an hour after lunch? To sit for me?
I'll pay our going rate. Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
All righty. I understand.
No. At least not in the legal sense.
Oh dear. If one must have a clinical name.
I never thought you were.
What way might that be?
Don't be ridiculous. I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides, you're not my type.
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
Sorry. Not today.
I just feel more comfortable keeping it on. You just said you didn't want me self conscious.
Suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders? Two buttons. Is that so much to ask? Just two little buttons.
Why not?
Very well put.
Ah. A philosopher.
I like that. But take care, Mr. Boone. Freedom is a drug, much like any other. Too much can be a very bad thing.
The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor. Anything to avoid losing the German market. They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb. For which I was blamed.
It's so far in the past now. Over fifteen years
Better work.
Twenty years. Too long. We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. So I finally decided to close down the show.
From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it. Understand?
Oh no. I never swim.
Everybody has stories to tell.
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown all part of the great gulf that stands between us. Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
No teammates in football? No comrades in Korea?
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
Not at all. I was in the foxholes myself.
I was an officer.
Why do I tell you this? I never told David. I never even remembered it until you got me going.
You're very clever, Mr. Boone. You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking. What a crazy old poof. Why are you here? What do you want from me?
Of course I remember. Do you think I'm so senile
I want I want...
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait. You cannot force what will not flow.
Very good, Clayton. May I call you Clayton? Or do you prefer Boone?
Nothing would please me more.
Exactly. Cukor was too cheap to hire music. There's nothing but chin wag. The cold dreary custard of English chin wag.
No. The girl.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Monsters? The only monsters...... are here.
Can't you see? It's raining!
We're not sugar. We won't melt.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
I'm afraid not. Terribly sorry. I believe I promised you some clothes.
Sorry. My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel? No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
Very sporting of you, Clayton.
I'd like to try again. If you're game.
Come now. I'm sure you came across such situations in Korea. A wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy? Someone for whom death would be a blessing.
That I was a Marine. Which is true. You filled in the rest.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over. He missed out.
That's not the way he saw it. To him, it was like his life never got started. Nothing else really mattered. Definitely not his family.
I figured he'd think, you know it was the next best thing. Hey, I loved it too. A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
I didn't have the guts for it.
Them's the breaks, right? No war stories for this pup.
That's from your movie, right? " The only monsters are here. "
James Whale. This afternoon at the party.
But that was so long ago. It can't still bother you.
You're planning a trip?
Oh no, my friend. It's digging itself up. There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it. All my diversions have abandoned me. Parties. Reading. Painting. Work. Love. All gone to me now.
You are much too human.
Don't move.
I don't know.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
It's too tight.
Oh, but you have. You undressed for me. I kissed you. I even touched your prick. How will you be able to live with yourself?
Did I hurt you?
Need some help?
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
You told me to get you up, asshole.
I told you. I don't turn on the TV except for the fights.
Then take the pills.
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
Goodbye, Hanna.
I was, until last night. Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
I did. But Princess Margaret was a doll. We're all equals in her eyes. As commoners, I presume.
Oh dear. I'll never work in this town again?
But I have no reputation. I'm as free as the air.
No. I never could. You must regret having had the invitation sent.
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to. You'll be fine on your own?
All right, then. I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
That's what I'm trying to explain.
That's as good a way as any to describe it. I've seen far worse cases. You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
In a manner of speaking. I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
Don't be daft. It's just a student from the university.
Oh shut up. All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
No. Let me lie here. Thank you.
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
Good night.
No. But someone you can talk to.
Of course. How is the old boy these days?
No. I do not cook for them. My daughter's no good husband will not take one bite of our food.
And this is your house. Wow. The house of Frankenstein. I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
I know. People's movies aren't their lives.
After you then.
I was born outside London, the only son of a minister who was a master at Harrow. Grandfather was a bishop. Church of... Church of Eng...
Of course. I attended Eton it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught. I was to go up to Oxford but the war broke out and I never made it. The Great War, you know. You had a Good War, but we had a great one.
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
Twenty one. The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking. The horror pictures were trifles. Grand guignol for the masses.
Let's make it more interesting. I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
You're serious.
Then the rumors are true?
That you were forced to retire because, uh a sex scandal.
Will you tell me everything you remember about making " Frankenstein "?
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Okay. " Frankenstein. " Tell me everything.
My idea. Muchly. My sketches. Big heavy brow. Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
You think so? That's very kind
Right.
You didn't?
You, Mr. Kay? How do you know George Cukor?
I commend you. If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you. You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
My monsters?
Grow up. You don't kill people like me. People like me die in their sleep at 87... Do you know why? Because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over California...
I'm just here about my brother.
And if he doesn't make it?
Look at this. A multi generational gathering of scumbags...
Get out
Right there
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing...
Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal... Goddamn, it... That was the deal...
What does that mean?
Whatcha got left...?
We'll take it...
We'll take it.
I'm cool
Sure
Hell, no. I boosted a'Vette.
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta'boosted it back...
You all right?
Just hold on there
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre requisite... Owwww...
Sure
I heard you were pumping gas
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
" About what? "
I can see that
" Over " You know I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron
He's gonna kill you!
You can handle it?
You can handle it?
You?
You?
You hear me?
Shadow games...
After a while, it became a little pathetic... Figured I'd put you out of your misery...
De nada...
Dad'd be proud
What era was that?
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement?
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars...
Come here
Come here
Toby...
Where'd you find this one?
You boost her?
Move over...
She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give'em sixty...
I gotta get my tool
We can't do that, dude
You look like you lost your sheep...
Buy you a drink?
So I was replaced by Mitch?
I left town. I didn't leave you.
And here I am...
Kip's in trouble
And you got some Italians?
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine...
The right side of the engine is running richer than the left. And the scope isn't showing shit... I dunno...
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
That's what I want...
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew... And give me up in the process.
No...?
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
I know. But let's prep'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good
Oh, God...
Unlock your button...
The alarms go off...
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
I do... I cut " em...
Now... I'm in...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism...
With a twist of my wrist... You're turned over...
Hear you roar...
Let me worry about The Club...
I've got you floored... We're off... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it... Momentum shift... Don't get on those brakes too hard... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up... Up... Up.
They got him to the hospital. He's stable...
She does have one thing you don't.
Bench seats.
You remember Junie?
What happened? Old age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to...
Tell me...
The hard part...
Is he still working here?
I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
Go to them. They'll be happy to see you... Ahhh...
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
The conundrum still applies, of course. The purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and / or a life of crime. However. This cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be.
Ten points for our fearless leader... Sway, how'bout giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta?
What happened to Sway?
Yeah, I'm cool...
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT 500.
All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say " Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser...
She soars
I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half hour between " FRIENDS " and " SEINFELD "...
How come...?
Come on. Kip, talk to the guy
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit... You know what you gotta do?
You have any other answers besides " not really "?
Right. You want to test the voltage drop... Use the voltmeter... Remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her... See what you got... You understand?
Why don't you leave him alone?
Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck
What? What happened?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Son of a bitch. Get over here.
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only kidding. You can't take a joke? Come ooonn.
No. No. The guy from downtown.
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
Anybody! You understand?
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
I couldn't wait to get away. I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check.
Talk? To you? After what you did!
They don't feel like you're in construction.
Get inside!
The bag with the envelopes.
Son of a bitch.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman. He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
You want her to visit you? Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody. Forget Paulie. As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
Never.
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie.
Hello! Hello! Have a good flight?
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
Who's gonna do that?
What are you talking about?
I flushed it down the toilet.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
Oh no! No! Noooo!
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
Fuck Paulie. If Batts'crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
We only have to shove'em over the moat.
We did it. We did it.
Have a drink first.
Don't worry about it.
So what? Where are they gonna go?
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
I better call again.
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
But I got two hundred and fifty coming. It's my share. Jimmy owes me.
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
Tell Michael not to 1et the sauce stick.
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important. Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Just make sure you do it. You know what I mean?
I gotta go home and get my hat.
What could I do? If she insisted, I had to drive her home for her goddamn hat. I threw the package in the kitchen and went to take her hone.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
Tommy. Come on. Relax.
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend? For Chrissake. Come on. You don't even have to stay. Jeesuz! What's the big deal?
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
I hate to do dishes.
So do I.
Okay?
Did he say what they're asking him about?
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
I know. I know. But it'll be okay. Don't worry. I got some money for you. It's down the block.
We'll pick it up.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
You think that matters? You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
You? You think you're the only one? I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
What can I do? If I could do something, don't you think I would?
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin'home...
I'm sorry,'cause you know Mikey, the fuckin guy loves animals, and this is the last person you'd want this to happen to.
Guy's tryin'to walk the line but he can't even fuckin'stand up, and so my uncle's gonna spend a night in jail. Just then there's this fuckin'BOOM like fifty yards down the road. Some guy's car hit a tree.
Least I work for a livin'. Why'd you get fired?
Oh, Morgan!
Watch what happens.
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids. You'd prob'ly fit right in.
You're fuckin'good.
I don't know.
I was countin'on it.
What?
Sorry, brother. I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
Some shows are worth the price of admission, partner.
Are they hookin'you up with a job?
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
It's a way outta here.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin'next door to me, comin'over watchin'the fuckin'Patriots'games and still workin'construction, I'll fuckin'kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin'kill you.
Listen, you got somethin'that none of us have.
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin'this. And that's all right'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin'on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin'insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin'or whatever and we have a few laughs. But you know what the best part of my day is? The ten seconds before I knock on the door'cause I let myself think I might get there, and you'd be gone. I'd knock on the door and you wouldn't be there. You just left.
Why didn't you yoke him?
Oh...
Good.
Is this a bad time?
Okay.
I just wanted to find out what was going on... But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
Fuck her.
She's not stupid.
What do you mean " your sandwhich? " I bought it.
How much money you got?
Well give me your fuckin'change and we'll put your fuckin'sandwhich on lay away.
I think you should establish a good line of credit.
No, why didn't you fight him at the park if you wanted to? I'm not goin'now, I'm eatin'my snack. WILL So don't go.
I told you " no " yesterday!
Holy shit.
I don't have a VCR at my house.
Oh, Morgan.
Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin'job. I had to let him help with the car.
You want us to give you cash right now?
Will you take a check?
How'd you like that course?
History? Just " history? " It must have been a survey course then.
Codebreaking.
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C. I. A.
Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one.
And what do you see?
What is it?
You don't have to be nervous, Will.
But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building
Building two.
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
I'm sorry.
Well... I'll be speaking to your supervisor.
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
Yes. Under two conditions.
That you meet with me twice a week
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
Okay. How?
I happen to know so.
That?
That edge!
I told you to cooperate with these people.
That's enough.
This can't be right. This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered
It's right. Take it home with you.
I couldn't go'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
Then don't set up any more meetings.
Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin'around and explaining shit to people.
You know how fuckin'easy this is to me? This is a joke! And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am.'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Sam called me. From Tri tech. He says you start working for them next week.
Bullshit.
Thank you, Will. I'll do that.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
I know. We just couldn't wait'till Monday to find out.
Who proved the theorem.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
You've heard of Albert Einstein?
So who won the bet?
Is there someplace we can talk?
You were missed. How long has it been since we've seen each other?
I'm sorry, that damn conference
Not much free time, Gerry. LAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan?
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age
Why me?
My kind of background?
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Can we do it at my office?
It's a poker game with this young man. Don't let him see what you've got.
You too, Gerry.
Why would he do that?
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the " old neighborhood? "
Timmy this is Gerry, an old friend of mine. We went to college together.
You moved?
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
Jobs doing what?
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
What don't I understand?
Einstein. Had two marriages, both train wrecks. The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum
Well, you're the only one.
Maybe he doesn't care about that.
No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you.
And confuse him
And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake
Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy I don't care if you have a few laughs even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
Oh, come on, Sean
Oh, that's nice
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been
Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
He won't be a failure!
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
Sean...
Where're you going?
Why there?
I got one of those too.
About thirty million to one.
About thirty million to one.
What do you want to do?
Who is he?
How fuckin'retarded do you have to be to get shit canned from that job? How hard is it to push a fuckin'broom?
So what do you got, a fuckin'Hyundai engine under there? Can I make it back to my house?
Probably not.
I'm not here for a fuckin'book report. They're your books, why don't you read'em?
That must have taken you a long time.
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books and they're the wrong fuckin'books.
Whatever blows your hair back.
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Oh.
Crayons?
Tell me what you really think.
What does?
What is?
Oh, " Starry Night " time, huh?
Sure, how'bout " still waters run deep "
Maybe what mea
Watch your mouth.
No.
Why thank you.
No.
I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
How'd it go?
Well, are you going out again?
Why not?
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
So Christ, call her up.
And right now you're perfect too. Maybe you don't want to ruin that.
My wife's dead.
My wife's dead.
Why not?
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean. All those guys were in your platoon?
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
When did you know she was the one?
Where were you?
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
I don't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar! That's game six of the World Series!
They could see that I meant it.
No Will, I'm not kiddin'you. If I had gone to see that game I'd be in here talkin'abouta girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago. And how I always regretted not goin'over there and talkin'to her. I don't regret the eighteen years we were married. I don't regret givin'up couseling for six years when she got sick. I don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. And I sure as Hell don't regret missing that damn game.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
What did you think?
Do you have a soul mate?
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul mate.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
Don't give me you line of shit.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin'brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop out.
You're right, Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man.
What?
Look at me. What do you want to do?
Do you want to talk about it?
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of
Yes.
The wrench, why?
I know.
I know.
I know.
Don't fuck with me.
I know.
I know, I know...
That's what you want?
Good for you. Congratulations.
We're done. You did your time. You're a free man.
I'll keep in touch.
Only if you grab my ass.
I've been sitting over there for forty five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta'get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Here's my number.
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
I was trying to be smooth. But at twelve fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
The caramel thing is my pick up line.
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
Sounds good, where are you now?
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
Sure.
Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole'good night kiss'thing.
No I haven't...
No I wasn't...
I was kinda'hopin'to get a " good night laid " but... I'll take a kiss.
Then why don't we just get it out of the way.
How was that?
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Yeah.
How many?
What, five?
Yup, you're lookin'at lucky thirteen.
I swear to God.
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
' Course I do, they're my brothers.
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
All the time. We all live in Southie. I live with three of them now.
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
You should have called. I have an " O chem " lab due tomorrow and it's impossible. It's not an excuse dummy. I want to go out with you. But look:
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
Then let's go have some fun.
I've never seen your place.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
When?
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
Want me to take a look?
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin'cages.
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin'on my swing.
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
Instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke? SKYLAR No, so I can be a doctor.
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Just for fun?
Nobody does organic chemistry for " fun. " It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Yeah. Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin'guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano
When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.
Come with me to California.
I want you to come with me.
I know. I just do.
I don't know. I just feel it.
Yeah, I'm sure.
" Take back? " What is that? I don't want a take back. I want you to come to California with me.
Why not?
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
Then what are you afraid of?
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else
Is that what you think
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
What about your twelve brothers?
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
Yes, I do, Will.
I don't want to " save " you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you!
' F we're workin'for you, it's our business too. An'how do we know you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
 Some  body got to take the blame. They just  got  to hang it on somebody, you know. An'I ain't doin'nothin'but set around.
Lissen. I don't care nothin'about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an'Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Sure. Why not?
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more. I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat  good  an'beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin'in the worl'but enemies wasn't  no  body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an'scared too like we was lost... an'nobody cared.
Oh.
Lots must a died, too.
Well, looks like we done it this time awright!
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin'when the rate dropped.
Short fella. Pale face.
I didn't see nothin'.
Cut me off a hunk a that banana cream, and a cuppa java.
Them was nickel apiece candy.
Deputy sheriffs.
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
How many of you?
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an'what they say goes.
That's the way it is.
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Government.
 You  find out, I can't.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
That cut you got?
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Well, I do declare! I baptized you, son.
 Used  to be. Not no more. I lost the call. But boy, I sure  used  to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin'full of repented sinners I pretty near  drowned  half of'em! But not no more. I lost the sperit.
I got nothin'to preach about no more that's all. I ain't so sure o'things.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory shoutin'till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort'em and always end up by lovin'' em. I'd feel bad, an'pray, an'pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin'their souls. I ast myself what  is  this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe  that's  love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes! So maybe there ain't no sin an'there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food but my heart ain't in it. Nice drinkin'liquor.
Been out travelin'around?
No, I never. What?
Excuse me for asking.
And you ain't ashamed?
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
It don't matter. Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other. I'll go your way.
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to  do  somepin'!
No. They wasn't people to write.
All right, you remember the  man  then.
It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin'an'then go on over to Uncle John's, I reckon. After that I don't know.
I'll say'em an'make it short. This here ol'man jus'lived a life an'jus'died out of it. I don't know whether he was good or bad, an'it don't matter much. Heard a fella say a poem once, an'he says, " All that lives is holy. " But I wouldn't pray for jus'a ol'man that's dead, because he's awright. If I was to pray I'd pray for the folks that's alive an'don't know which way to turn. Grampa here, he ain't got no more trouble like that. He's got his job all cut out for'im so cover'im up and let'im get to it.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin'parole?
Hide in the willows. If it's awright to come back I'll give you four high whistles.
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
No, I done my time an'got out. Come on in.
I don't expeck we can las'much longer some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin'back tonight?
Well tell the folks inside how it is, Tom. Tell'em they're starvin'us and stabbin'theirself in the back. An'as sure as God made little apples it's goin'back to two an'a half jus'as soon as they clear us out.
They won't. They're a gettin'five an'they don't care about nothin'else.
Got to learn, like I'm a learnin'. Don't know it right yet myself, but I'm tryin'to fin'out. That's why I can't ever be a preacher again. Preacher got to  know . I don't. I got to  ask .
You ain't you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
But we can still do it, honey.
We ain't campin'. We jus'stoppin'a minute
Sure do.
What's the matter? What's happened?
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin'it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
 Used  to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
Lookin'for a job?
Oh!
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time. Got a trade?
Get to what?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
I stay in my own yard.
You ain't got to get sore.
I didn't mean nothing.
Yeah.
Crossin'the desert in a jalopy like this.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin'it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Well, fi'cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
Sure. We made a buck since midday.
Yes, ma'am.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin'to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
But you can't  do  that, Grampa. This here land is goin'under the tractor. We  all  got to git out.
Put somepin'over him, so he won't git sun struck. Ever'body set now? Awright, Al, letta go!
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
Got any plants?
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back? or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see'em inside the tent.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
But will it hurt the baby?
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
I like the tent better.
Stand by the door.
I can't he'p it, Ma. It don't make  me  giggly an'happy.
No an'look what I got for you.
You'll  what ?... Come on, Pa. Come on an'whup me. Jus'try it.
Al ain't a goin'away, an'you gonna  tell  him he ain't a goin'away. An'if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
Pa! Shh!
Mad, Ma?
No, Ma I was at first but not no more.
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Forget it, Ma. Jus'think about the nice things out there. Think about them grapes and oranges an'ever'body got work
Look, Ma!
Didn'you get no sleep?
Was Granma bad?
When?
An'that's why you didn't want'em to look?
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin'with, we could take it. But it  ain't  the law. They're workin'away at our spirits. They're tryin'to make us cringe an'crawl. They're workin'on our decency.
I'm a tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
What's that detour?
You know, I jus'can't remember when I felt so good before!
Looks like you done it.
Folks ain't talkin'about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin'about a lynchin'when they catch the fella.
That ain't the way they're tellin'it. They're sayin'you done it fust.
They know he got hit in the face.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin'away ain't gonna ease us. They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol'folks died off, an'little fellas come, an'we was always one thing we was the fambly kinda whole an'clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin'keeps us clear. Al he's a hankerin'an'a jibbitin'to go off on his own. An'Uncle John is just a draggin'along. Pa's lost his place he ain't the head no more. We're crackin'up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn she gonna have her baby, but  it  ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin'to keep her goin'but Winfiel'what's he gonna be, this a way? Growin'up wild, an'Ruthie, too like animals. Got nothin'to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an'help. Help me.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya an'see your face when you an'Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an'you'd be in trouble too.
You know what I been thinkin'about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an'about how he died. An'I remember all of it.
I been thinkin'about us, too about our people livin'like pigs, an'good rich lan'layin'fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan'farmers is starvin'. An'I been wonderin'if all our folks got together an'yelled
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus'fin'out sump'n. Jus'scrounge aroun'an'try to fin'out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it. But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul the one big soul that belongs to ever'body an'then...
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun'in the dark. I'll be ever'where wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin'up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad an'I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an'they know supper's ready. An'when our people eat the stuff they raise, an'live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
Me neither. It's jus'stuff I been thinkin'about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good by.
Sure. Good by.
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen cent loafs.
Go ahead Bert says take it.
They gone.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin'to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks. Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin'off.
Listen! That's some of what done it the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin'like this, year after year blowin'the land away, blowin'the crops away, blowin'us away now.
Some say I am. You want to hear what happened?
The rest of my fambly set out for the west there wasn't nothin'to eat but I couldn't leave. Somepin'wouldn't let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell myself I was lookin'out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin'to look out for. And ain't nobody comin'back. They're gone and me, I'm just an'ol graveyard ghost that's all in the world I am.
You're  trespassin'! It ain't you lan'no more! An'that's the supr'tendant with a gun!
I don't think so. One come out here once an'I clipped him from behin'with a fence stake. They ain't bothered since.
I can't help that. All I know is I got my orders. They told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what I'm telling you.
Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't  nobody  going to push me off  my  land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was  all  born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn bein'born on it, and workin'it, and dyin'on it and not no piece of paper with writin'on it! So just come on and try to push me off!
Easy. After all, they ain't but about  twelve  of us, is they?
Ain't no whisky, is they?
Casy, won't you say a few words?
Give'im a fryin'pan.
No. I'm jus'gonna set awhile an'then go to bed.
You're tootin'we're gonna stay.
You do not see either! not yet!
Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave word for him. Jus'don't cry.
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you. I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Some, I guess, but mos'ly cow bones.
It's them white things, made outa dish stuff, like in the catalogues!
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
Please don't.
You people looking for work?
Can you pick peaches?
Well, there's plenty of work for you about forty miles north, this road just outside Pixley. Turn east on 32 and look for Hooper's ranch. Tell'em Spencer sent you.
You ain't to hurt them fellas.
Ain't gonna get outa han'.
You don't...
Oh... really?
What do you do?
You do not.
You're so funny...
Stop it
No.
So, what are you doing now?
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Not much, actually. My software company just went public so I'm just... hanging out, really.
It's me. Martin Blank.
Okay. See you later.
Never better.
I want to be an actor.
Ten years, I think. What I miss?
That's it?
What's your business?
Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
Torn down in the name of convenience
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being?
That's part of it.
It's always the little things.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
You met people.
Watched television?
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Yes.
Seven it is.
Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
You're fucking psycho.
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
Right.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
No time.
Too junky kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Could be. The physical substance of love.
Not the other way around...?
Is it something you've done?
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain " Moral flexibility " would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA sponsored program. It's called " mechanical operations. " We sort of found each other...
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
I was leaving.
Will you come with me?
What if I come back?
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
Other people can't.
Do you like the people you work with?
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, " Tell them fuckin'people to get out here and get in this car, I can't I want a go! " Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; they can't handle it.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
It's only natural....
Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind. I am part of what I call a brain syndicate.
And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it?
Like a union?
Thank you, no.
And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
I'm gonna get you, kid.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
Is that right?
Nice talk, Sugarmouth.
Don't listen to him, he's a professional.
Not bad. You?
Lisbon?
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the
Yes. And the Munich Olympics in'72. A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened.
Whatever.
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
Wait a minute
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
I love. I kill.
I get it.
Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble.
Patch him through....
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
I'll pay.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
They blame you for the compromise.
In Detroit. This weekend.
They were very upset.
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
Will do.
What's a revival tent?
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass!
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
You have a headache?
No, I don't have one.
Of course you will.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
You're leaving me hanging here...
Fair enough.
No. You drove us here.
No.
Thank you.
How could you put your hard earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
Mein Dealer.
As long as you had a good time.
I have to get my head back into my work.
Well, you know, however you want to put it I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister in law, I think, gave me this number. I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
Doesn't matter.
You can make it as complicated or as easy as you like. But she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am I right? So here's the deal. I'm not sure I can do anything, but I'm prepared to give it a go if you'll help. You have a problem with that?
That's up to Pilgrim.
You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger. You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
You lived in Chicago?
You were married to a woman in Chicago?
Just who's been laughing at who here?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Oh yes. I forgot.
She did?
I can handle it!
Poor thing.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
OK. I'll stop talking then.
Thanks.
Yeah.
OK.
Son?
How did you meet her?
Ever think of moving there full time?
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
Just make yourself comfortable.
Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
One more time.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
Why?
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
It's still early. What's your next class?
No, you didn't.
Doesn't matter.
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
Yeah?
What?
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
Fine!
Oh. You didn't tell me.
You don't.
I don't care.
You know what I mean? Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
I don't believe this!
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
Did he tell you that?
That's not true!
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
What would they say? " Ten miles to big rock. " " Twenty miles to bigger rock. "
I didn't see it.
Did he mention it?
No. I just thought... forget it.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Thanks, honey.
Well... So you tried riding again?
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you
What are you talking about?
Grace, I don't hate your father.
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
WHAT?! How can you I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
When? Tonight?
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Why should they?
So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway...
Sure.
How's everything?
Hi.
Hi.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
Riding with Judith.
I don't know. We'll figure it out.
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
The funeral's on Friday.
It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...... Whether or not we were...... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
How's my pregnant chick!
Aw... that's so sweet.
Do you? Do you really?
Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.
Why did you go?
What did he say?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
NO! What are you you're serious about this?
You've already made arrangements!?
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the
What... Bo... What about the magazine?
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
I'm not pretending anything!
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Well, it's good that you're there.
When are you coming home?
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
Good night.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Huh huh. You?
I wish I did.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Honey, I hope you're not endangering your position. Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I'll work it out. I mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
I can see why you put your faith in him. He's a genuine... good guy... Good at what he does. That's rare.
How are you feeling about work?
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
Yeah, what?
What do you mean?
And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them. See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more. But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore... And I don't want you to come home until you do know...... one way or the other.
No. I am a " tubab. "
Tubab means white man.
Where to?
Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as good as falling down around your ears.
What choice!!?
Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place.
Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love'em all the same.
No reason you should, no reason you should.
What was it like?
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
They fired you?
You don't seem to upset?
Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home.
Frank's a good man.
Sounds like something Tom would say.
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
No, no, I'll go just give me a list.
Promise.
Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.
Well, of course, right...
See, what you can do for him...
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is
And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem! I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay? Please.
Of course not.
I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long.
I believe women from New York eat mixed salads. Ain't that right, Tom?
Frank's touchy about his cousins. Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
Ain't brain surgery.
There's a kid at school says we should've imprint trained him.
There was this thing on the TV about a guy who does it with geese. He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow. You hear'bout that, Uncle T?
Of course I have.
I wouldn't let happen.
What does she do?
Mmm. An editor.
It's never too soon to start.
Well, there's only one way to find out. Give it a little gas.
Not a question of if you can you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.
That must have been pretty special.
I know you do. Don't you disappear. You do whatever you have to, to hold on... I'll tell you one more thing... When Pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what I think?... I think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... That's what I think.
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
Grace, Listen... you've got to do this. Just trust me one more time.
I thought your mom's coming up?
How's Pilgrim doing?
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
WAS SO!
You shut up, stupid!
How much longer do you think?
I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Oh oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
The number's by the phone.
Long enough.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
What stuff is that?
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
Well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts. That's the whole lesson right there. You have a good day now... Just... keep on freeing yourself up.
Cool?
You think it's cool?
It's not cool. It's commie bullshit!
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
How are you going to take care of the cops?
Was that her top?
Looks like a hacker wrote it.
This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
Yo, hit the lights.
You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.
Yeah?
Roger.
And what's he do?
Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
Thank you!
Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file.
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!
Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?
Give it up! Just give it up.
No.
I got photographic memory. It's a curse! Lisa!
It nibbles. You see this?
Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes.
No, you're not in my class.
I'll give it a shot.
He's not enrolled in this class.
I'm Crash Override.
It's too much machine for you.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Yeah. RISC is good.
Yeah.
Name your stakes.
Your slave?
And if I win?
Make it our first date.
And you have to smile.
Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?
Okay, thank you.
I have to tell you something.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
What?
You what?
How?
They're elite! Let's get'em.
We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.
Alright, let's boot up.
Thanks for your help.
Wanna go for a swim?
Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
Uhhhmm...
212 555 4240.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!
Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
Good.
It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do?
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson is working really hard. We got one person online, the workload is enough for like ten users. I think we've got a hacker.
Let's echo 23, see what's up.
What? whatwhatwhat?
Love, secret, and uh, sex. But not in that order, necessarily, right?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
Phreak?
You think they're going to bust us?
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
What?
I don't want to go to jail for this.
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Pervert! What are you talking about?
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.
You said the worm was untreaceable!
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
" Minor glitch " with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
What number please?
Just one moment.
You're late.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
I'll take you down there.
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
Its about tonight.
So?
When did you find this out?
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel... shit
I'm not angry it's just
So?
Okay, I guess. I'll call you later.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off... that's all.
What's going on?
Who's that?
Look.
We're trapped in this house.
Brady!
Go!
Get up there Rachel!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Can't you find somebody else?
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
Why not?
Because the lights are all out.
We should call the fire department.
Who you calling?
Okay, out.
What is this? Four nights in a row? You going for a record here? The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Oh, serious questions tonight. Of course I love you.
Jamie, sometimes it's...
We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.
It's been eleven months.
Your lucky. I wish she could do the same for me.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick or treating.
It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy?
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
I wanna go trick or treating like the other kids.
What?
I thought you said you were ready.
Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.
Come on.
Well try dammit!
Rachel!
Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?
Yeah.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
Just do it.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
Wise up to what men want Rachel, or Brady won't be the last man you lose to another woman.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
You won't look pushy.
You won't come on too strong.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate. Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Where are you going?
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Do you?
You look sharp. You understand?
Ben uh I just heard about the station.
Go get it.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
Hey. I got a town full of beer bellies running around in the dark with shotguns. Who's gonna be next? Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid?
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
Why?
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
Myers has been locked up since before she was born. He's never laid eyes on her.
Its true, Sheriff.
Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T. V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
How do you know?
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Sort of.
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
Okay.
Uh huh.
What?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?
That's not true. Here I am.
Sure.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Saving the treats for Bob?
Exploring uncharted territory?
I forgot my chemistry book.
Behind that bush there.
Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
Cute.
Annie, was that you?
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
I've already lost it.
Sure, see you later.
Lies.
Probably Mister Riddle.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty seven.
That's probably all he can do.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
You guys will make a fabulous couple.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Yes, you can.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
I don't know.
I don't want to.
I want to stay here and watch this.
Totally...
I can't. What if it's the Wallaces!? We'd get Annie in trouble.
Want a beer?
Is that all you say?
Go get me a beer.
YEAH?
Yeah, sure.
Yeah.
It's important.
They may be right.
I am. I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six year old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
I'll check back in an hour.
Sure...
You have the wrong feeling.
Exactly what do you need?
I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
They could be.
Where?
TOTALLY!
It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you.
Is Annie around?
Well, she's totally not here.
Okay. Later.
Can we make Jack O Lanterns?
Can we watch the monster movies?
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
Just watch.
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
Mom doesn't like me to have them.
What about the rest of my comic books?
What about the bogyman?
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
No...
There WAS.
The bogyman!
Right.
Promise?
Can we make the Jack O Lantern now?
I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
HURRY!
How?
But you can't kill the bogyman.
You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie.
Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand?
Yes, she is.
She's washing her clothes.
Okay.
I've given them his profile.
There's nothing else I can do.
PROBABLY going.
Thorazin.
That's the idea. Here we are.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
If you say so.
I see.
It means... I see.
I couldn't if I tried.
You don't have anything to worry about. He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.
Move it!
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
... because there are no interesting single men at this party!
He's the He looks like Ichabod Crane?
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's. I do the, uh, cr  pes caviar.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Great.
Great.
Uh APRIL I i it has an o organic quality, you know.
It's almost... almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean. I I... I can't put it into words. The important thing is is is it it breathes.
It feels like you're in France.
It's really terrible.
Well, wait. You know what? I know.
If... well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then then then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive... or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
What?
You're joking.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
And you, you you're going?
But I'm seeing him.
Gee, um... I... I don't know what to say.
Hmm?
And maybe my lawyer.
I can't resist.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers. Something's wrong.
Is this your first job?
Oh no. Not at all.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
And in the material. That's... that's unpolished red granite.
... and open the French doors and go on the balcony
They fit right in together. And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...
It does.
Fast.
Well, I I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
Mm hm.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family. I mean, he's, you know, he's
Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear... or my left ear, my, my left... oh, n n n no. No, I'm sorry. It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
Oh, uh, about a month ago. Wha what do I have?
And it's just in one ear?
You know, there's no reason for panic. I just want to rule out some things.
It's nothing. Will you trust me?
Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol. And I got a Frank Stella, too. Oh, it's very beautiful. Big, weird... you know. If you stare at that Stella too long, the colors just seem to float. It's kinda weird.
It's not that big a deal. We just didn't hit it off.
Are you okay? You look You're sweatin'. ELLIOT Yeah. Yeah, I just just need so some some fresh air. It's probably something I ate. I'll I'll walk. You go ahead.
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Yeah. Some of them... yeah, some of them are very big.
Okay. Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty?
... with the affiliates.
Yes, but you name names.
Hi.
Well, I'm I'm looking for a bookstore.
Yes. Yeah, I I'm kill
Well, yes, I'm killing time. I have a client near here and I... I'm quite early.
How about you?
Oh, yes! You live near here, don't you?
Where are you headed?
Yeah, unhappy and fat. And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
I think to myself what problems could she possibly have?
Yes? LEE A couple of blocks from here. If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Yeah, you would.
Yeah, sure.
What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT What? Book?
No! No...
Uh, yes!
How how's Frederick?
Oh, oh, yes. I I I'd like to, uh, uh, very much.
I I read a poem of you and thought of his last week. A poem of his and thought of you last You'll be fine, though. Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle. She looks at the book.
Yes, I'd... I I I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
And and maybe, um... maybe we could discuss it sometime.
Well, yeah, yeah. You'd love it. It's really entertaining. You'd have a good time. I know you would.
Bye.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
But I go nuts. It's a conflict.
Yes. This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
He's got like six gold records.
Oh, I would love to hear it.
I... I'm I'm I'm I'm sorry. I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
I I, I'm sorry. I know it's terrible.
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Wh, it it it it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Oh, no, no. Well, yes! I love you.
Oh, no, no, no. It, uh, it it it it was i inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
Tch, w well, for a million reasons.
Tch, no! We were, we were both going in different directions.
But but, but how about you? Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
W well, please be candid. I, I I don't want you to feel bad.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
Lee... uh...
No, no no no, I'm sure.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
Is something wrong?
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
I've got to be honest with you. I met someone else. I've met someone else. I... I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
Yeah, but we we made so many plans.
Lee...
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
That's where your talent lies.
Mmm.
It's so late.
Yes, you were. A and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Why not?
Why do you say that? Is there something wrong?
Well, tell me. Should I be worried?
I want one with you.
But what do, what do you what's that mean? W w we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
Yeah, but I... uh I thought you needed that. When when when we met, you said your life was chaos.
No!
I didn't say that.
My God! Wha what is this? The Gestapo? No.
Are you?
What, you, of c What are you talking about? Of course not. I'd be destroyed!
This is a toast. You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...
... just for a second. So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know. B b b but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
But why? We raised you as a Jew.
So?
Of what? I'll be unconscious.
How do you know?
Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Hmm?
Have I really taught you everything I have to give? I don't think so.
Me?
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.
Oh! Are we going to have this conversation again?
Why?
What are you going to use for money?!
Tch, oh. I always told you you would leave me. But... does it have to be now?
Oh... Lee, you are my whole world. Good God! Have you been kissed tonight?!
Oh, yes, you have!
You've been with someone!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
So you met somebody else?
What's the difference?! It's just somebody I met!
It doesn't make a difference! I have to move out!
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway? I mean... it's not sexual anymore. It's certainly not intellectual. I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that
Like
Oh, God! Do you hear a buzzing? Is there a buzzing?
But there's nothing wrong with you.
Well, he has to rule out certain things.
I don't know. Cancer, I
But you don't have any symptoms!
It was on your shirt!
Can you understand how meaningless everything is? Everything! I'm talking about nnnn our lives, the show... the whole world, it's meaningless.
No, I'm not dying now, but, but you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right. And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop,'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay. I'm not going to go tomorrow. But eventually, I'm going to be in that position.
Yes, please.
No.
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
Yes!
You've outdone yourself.
Come on.
I bumped into your...
Oh, yeah? How's she doing?
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh she gets so defensive.
Do you miss Frederick?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know
I'm okay.
Y yeah.
Yeah. I I don't know what's wrong with him. He's just... kind of distant and difficult.
I've been trying to talk to him about it. He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
She's going through a really rough time right now.
Yeah?
Yeah. I'll get some ice.
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Very good.
... a little, uh, hey! A little hug! What is this? Now how'bout a little action from the kids?
Yeah? Yeah? Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Yeah?
Oh!
Really? That'll be terrific for him, I think.
I like him. I think he's a sweet guy.
The few times that I've met him... Isn't that a great mitt?
I know, I know.
That's really nice!
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
Mh hm.
Isn't that great?
Go right over there.
Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this.
How could I ruin myself? What do you mean, ruin myself?
Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies? Jesus!
What are you talking about?
What, by a st stranger?
I want to experience childbirth.
Just think about it. That's all I ask.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes. He's all show! Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
Now, Holly's not shy.
I'd have been a great dope addict.
This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
I know. H how much do you need?
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy... and some old debts I have outstanding.
Okay.
I swear. I swear. We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
Tch. He's such an angry... he's such a depressive. I thought she was moving out!
He's such a loser!
Oh, he's such a loser!
Oh, perfect! He reminds me of Ichabod Crane. His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH Listen. He's a lot better than your ex husband. He's got a good job. Would you light those, please? He's he's he's not a dope addict or anything.
Maybe at Christmas, New Year's. If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
Well, I, I really like that. I think that's a pretty color on you.
... and then she just breaks down. And he has this sweet daughter... and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently. I mean...
... he's really paid his dues, but... then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...
Yeah, can you believe it?
Well, I mean, why not? You know, wh what have I got to lose? Uh...
I know, no I know.
No, I'm sorry. No, I didn't mean that. No, I didn't mean that.
Easily.
Yeah.
I hope.
Tch, well, I sing! For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
Oh, what do they know?
No. She, didn't she say it was, um... she said it was in the publicity department. That that can lead to other things.
Yeah, you mean not at my age.
You never have any faith in my plans. You always undercut my enthusiasm.
I'm I'm always happy to help you financially. I think I've gone out of my way to to introduce you to interesting single men. There's nothing I would
You're too demanding.
What's the matter?
Good.
Oh, so loosely.
Well
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know. Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. " You're so giving. It's not a criticism. We love you. We're grateful. "
Oh, wow! I don't want to have this conversation. I didn't do anything wrong.
That's the point. I'd like to be bothered.
No, he hasn't. If I offended you, I'm sorry.
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy! The room's alive with positive vibrations!
My uh...
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you! I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you. Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music. I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Now come on, you're be,'cause you're being angry at me.
I was so bored!
At least I'm open to new concepts!
This crowd wouldn't know the difference! They're embalmed!
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
God!
Yes, you do recall, right?
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
... and I thought I'd come in and... and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Oh, that's putting it mildly. We did everything but exchange gunshots.
Good. How are you?
You look wonderful.
Yeah, really. You do. You do.
It was a terrible evening.
Remember slamming the cab door in my face and.. you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a...
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
People change... you know.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
... namely a personality.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Well...
Yeah? Is that an embarrassing question? Should I have not asked it?
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Have you?
Well, that's interesting. Wh what kind of stuff?
No, you can tell me.
No, I am. I am.
Nobody ever said it.
This is it. Yeah. This is really HOLLY Well, wo would you be willing to to read it? Something... that I wrote?
No, the reason I ask is
No, I haven't.
I haven't. No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so
You're kidding me.
... which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it. But
Oh, I'm fine.
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually,'cause I really would value your opinion.
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
... Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I
Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
Well, what about me?
I should have kept going. I I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and...
Really?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Right.
Oh!
Oh, wow!
Uh, gee. Would you like to have lunch? Uh, uh...
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
Y you used to Oh, no! Yeah, I care. You used to be so ambitious and... God, you really liked it?!
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh... I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
It's all right.
Do you? I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Hi. How you doin'?
When'd you get here?
Oh. You look so beautiful.
Tch.
I'm pregnant.
Mm hm.
Where are the antihistamines?
Dad!
We have to talk about money...
A reward...
A reward for what?
And?
... you haven't found him yet.
You've gone off to America, on your Vacation...
... please...
... and I want to talk to you about your promotion..
I want to talk to you about your salary. Because I can't...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
And now I have " dociled " you, have I not? By forcing your obedience.
To show... in my ability to squander. What one might deem an advantage... that my strength is greater than yours...
If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.
It wasn't my day.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
... how are things at the Hospital?
What have they got you doing?
I would have figured you an R. N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
... you...
I'm looking for...
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
Yes?
Why me?
... very good.
... why?
You said " here's what they want you to do... " Why?
That would adversely impact my income.
We could skip the Gavotte.
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his " mind, " do you see...?
There's one or two freaks, and, for a " Pass, " I'll rat them out to you...
... aren't you afraid of me...?
I'd prefer it... But it's just a vacant exercise.
... why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
Oh, Good. The ornithological leitmotif...
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Who would that be.
No, you're wrong about Verger.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
You're ready now.
That's what you think...
I feel... I feel they're Out to Get Me...
... they're sending me. Out to get Shot. Hounding me.... they're...
How crazy is that.
How crazy is that....
That's right.
What's new onna street?
... these guy'll back you up.
I almost shot the baby...
... nightmare.
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
Their family owns...
... are they hard to get?
... what a world.
First things first.
That's why my wife adores me.
Why did he come back?
... WHY DID HE COME BACK? WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM. Where have we Seen it Before.
The puppy comes back. If you lie on the ground. The Puppy with return. Why? Do you know why...? TO KILL YOU. IT THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS. IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK. As Lechter will return back. You see? To the sight of his oppressor wounded. He will return to savage our beloved Miss Starling. Bring me a drink.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
That operation has begun. Are we God, that we would Meddle with it...? No, on the other hand...
I like Popcorn...
You give me whatever I want...?
Awright.
... they're from Baltimore....
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am. It's just something he does.
He's glad to help.... it's just a question of his physical condition. You Understand...
Now, why in the world would he do that?
What reaction?
Please, I do not... I don't want to trouble him. But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
He is...?
And how would you know that?
You should get the kids a dog...
No, no, of course not.
Tell him to give it to an orphanage.
... here's to child abuse!
... and then, he'll be coming down.
Yes, I did.
Oh, yes, what? You'd bribe me, to, to, to, " release " you...?
And I expect you to. Let's talk like two medical men
.. suitcase... locker...
... unmarked hundreds....
Why?
' fraid it's too late.
I could have acted on my own. I was told...
.. I was instructed that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
One moment, and they're at the Seven Eleven. They botched the fallback plan, they...
He once made me an improper suggestion.
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina. Look here:
A fellow with five fingers.
Not for our Doctor Lechter. This... Purports to be an x ray of the hand of a... white male... mmmm.... mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand. It purports to be the x ray of Dr. L...
No.
I am all attention.
Reinstatement to what? There ain't nobody there...
I had... one moment, I had an agent in there, waiting for backup from...
What is that supposed to mean...?
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
One moment, I'm not done with you... Give him the file...
Well, then, you have insufficient information. I'm grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.
Evone tells me: I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
I'm an orphan.
What'd you say, hon...?
Well, don't you worry, cause that baby's gone take care of that.
Waal...
Give it up.
I never met him. I knew him only from his writings.
... yes.
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
Yes. Packed and with an inventory.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? La Vita Nuova?
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard? Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but clean. Just dressed in the middle of the...
I'm a historian. It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
My scar is a war wound.
Carpal tunnel syndrome. From a life of typing. Commendatore. History, a hazardous profession.
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist. You have seen the chapel?
How could you know?
You know America?
The commissioner is going round the Cafe...
I've left my program...
I require...
With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean.
She's not the first foster that you've had. Is she?
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
Yes.... yes...
Yes. Franklin, you can't live there anymore. With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat. You have to go away.
The government says. Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother. The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home. You can't see Mama anymore. Or Shirley. Or Kitty Cat. That's what the Government says...
... tell them...
Well, I don't want to starve them too long. They die.
You were given backup....
I'm saying:... and what's wrong with that.
No, I don't get you...
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
I realize, you're under a lot of....
I'm going to cut you loose. With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...? Do right and you'll live through this.
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
I hope you'll find it so. Yes. It's good to see you regaining your strength...
Indeed we were.
Freud, do you know...? Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
He saw the truth, and spoke it...
... you have to eat...
Why should you care?
ARE YOU DONE?
You don't wish to beg...?
Explain in depth the plan we have for him. Until tomorrow.
... which of us is free...?
The girl needs help.
... might I make a suggestion...?
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
Oh baby, oh baby....
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
I am no going to show you the secret handshake!
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
My daddy would say: accept with glee the things you cannot change.
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion. Here we've got a purported x ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery. Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
I don't wanna go out there at all...
No. I want to buy a dog.
I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine...
... what?
Yeah. Well. They're a talkative buncha commentators.
Trouble is, they all seem to die.
What would you guess, Ardelia?
Don't shoot yourself.
Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you. Why dontcha gimme the gun?
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
His feelings do him honor. And I have come, simply, to pay my respects to the great Clarice Starling...
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
Thank you.
... what a lovely perfume.
Do you. What does that mean?
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a " clue "...
I din't solve it, I didn't'solve it'. I just sat a dance out with him. Facts, facts, facts. Facts, close the case, cavalier.
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
It would seem.
... I feel that...
Thirty thousand dollars reward. In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
Because we must leave the past in the past. Ah. And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived. And because you have large resources.
" Why? " If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love " love " Damn you, Damn this, damnit!
Why are you being so grouchy This is an important night for us...
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Did you wait until you were 18?
No.
Yowza Only a virgin could answer that fast.
She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club. Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
I couldn't tell her... it's, it's too major... Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right? Wendy and I we're meant to be. I'm right, right? I have to see her...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out You'll know it when you see it...
Of course you are. You don't know what I was like before I met you. You're like the best counselor ever.
Everything.
This is... this is... a very special moment...
Ooh, I'll think of something, missy. A telescope? Where you going? I don't want to know.
When all else fails, Jasper Gum. Even now in these troubled times,  every child's drug of choice. 
Not so secret anymore. Don't look all at once... behind the pine... Dorothy from Cabin Seven.
Wichita you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
Goodnight, Jasper.
Hello?! What's in it for me?
That would be a No.
Don't worry, I have 33 more days to find just the perfect moment to tell him how I...
They're the easiest to shoplift, okay? No woman should have to pay for something forced on her without choice by Nature... what's the matter, Hayley?   As they playfully bicker, Hayley gazes, with a tinge of  longing, to Vanessa and the Bombshellettes parked at a picnic  table, flirting up a storm with their cute boy counterparts.   TALIA  What do you think it's the Last  Night of Camp Dance.   PIXEL  What are you saying? She doesn't need  some boy to validate her summer  experience!   TALIA  Oh of course she does, you dumb  bitch. Just because we're feminist,  doesn't mean we have to be totally  abnormal.   PIXEL  Hayley back me up...   HAYLEY   One dance would be kind of  nice... Don't hate me, Pixel.   PIXEL   I don't. Now go away, Talia and I  need to huddle... 
Geez, what time is it? I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon... You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is. I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to Are you a lesbian or are you...
Why do you even like me?
Uh huh.
Exactly. When we get into the clearing, I'll turn on my sexy moves. Wichita will go for it or he'll shoot me down. Either way, you come away with knowledge.
It's just funny... who needs a serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw when we have ourselves.
Yes, it does.
"... how important our friendship... " Not that old Oh God, what have I done?
Stop, stop, what was I thinking... out in the wilderness. Under the stars. I've ruined every
I gotta... I gotta go do a " bunk check. " Or some fucking thing.
That's not what I was worried about.
We had fun. I even got along with Talia for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
Yeah. I guess I do.
I think your condescension is even better.
You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
" Iunno. " I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
I was thinking... if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way  of thinking, we could really do some  great counseling. It's all about  the evolution of the species, we  can improve... 
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Probably.
This isn't about " doing it. " I just think we need to talk some things out privately before...
Something more interesting than that... How could you? How could!
Iunno. Of course I believe you. It's so you... I didn't think it was possible  for you to make me feel worse,  but... you're saying you deliberately  destroyed us! I don't even get I'm  sorry it was the heat of the  moment...   WICHITA  I know, I'm... I'm evil.   WENDY  Oh that's right, baby, you're so  " evil. " You're, you're so " dark "...   WICHITA  We should get back.   WENDY  You're not evil or dark... you're  just scared. 
Nice guys finish last. I should know.
Gee, thanks.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.
You don't deserve my fucking speech!
What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her! What are you smiling at?
Oh yeah, that's it.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Oh yeah, that's it.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
I don't get treated at all, but hey, don't worry about it. I'll do your thing. It'll give my Mom a smile.
That's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7 11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? " Bringing every State to a Higher State. "
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
I saw the croquet set up in the back. Up for a match?
Killing her won't solve anything.
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm.
Good plan.
You're not funny.
And your worst enemy.
I'm just a little freaked, all right? You got what you wanted, you know.
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word " myriad. "
She missed " myriad " on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
You're probably right... " People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too. "
That's good. Have you done this before?
Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, Dad?
You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie and Clyde days are over.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it was World War Two, not a school play.
Neat. Let's try it out on J. F. K.
Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed.
You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one perfecto thing I picked up...
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Don't move! I'll get him back!
Did to.
Did to.
Don't even talk about that stuff!
May be.
I could be up for that. I've already started underlining meaningful passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on?
This knife is filthy.
I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless.
The bomb, asshole!
You know what I want, babe?
You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean.
Let's kick his ass.
Answer him dick!
Pretty weird.
Cool off, we're seniors.
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!
Any contestants worth mentioning?
All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized.
What, the wine? I realize you're all under 21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch. Could we get some more light up here?
We have to talk. Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
I'm not sure... but it's proving to be very popular!
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the'frigerator.
And Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
Whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
Thought I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday... anyone want to give me a hand?
What now?
Bye.
Come on, sit up.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
Starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
Holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
Juliet's infectious... she'll be going to hospital.
Her parents won't be going overseas now... they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
Can I go now?
Whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
Steps back.
What does old Stew want?
Who cares!
I'm educating myself!
Snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
You're rude... rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You have to let me go!
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
Looks startled at the outburst.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?
Oh what a nice outfit!
Fruit.
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
What???
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
John has fallen in love with me!
Let's go overseas...
Just a couple more...
That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
Too right... but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
I know what to do about mother.
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal...
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
That  poor me'attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
I miss her. I miss my wife.
I'm all over it.
I know, my bedside manner's horrendous.
It's inside a moving car.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Skin cancer.
Pitbull attacks.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
I did more then that.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
No.
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
I understand... I won't
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...
Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday?
Since what?
Getting paid for doing shit.
I have my connections
Gwen.
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
I quit. Today's my last day.
As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
Yeah? You and who else?
Bret. What the hell is going on?
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
How do you think you got this job, cock? Mmm. I'm still tingling all over from our little midnight swim.
And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Eighty four.
If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick tock...
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
THE BABY IS COMING OUT! I CAN FEEL IT! SONOFABITCH IT HURTS!! AAAGGGGHHH!!!
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
Never to put you in my will.
I only married you for your body.
Okay then. Here's the scoop.
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
We're all here for you Trevor.
I swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me. I think they got a hold of my e mail address at work too.
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm.... ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.
Music to my ears.
Hey buddy!
We're just gonna take some blood here.
Can you follow them?
I hear everything. And soon you will know everything. More than you ever wanted I can guarantee that. But I want you to think for a minute first. Think about all you've seen. All the clues you've been given.
Use your mind for something other than numbers dear Trevor. Think about people for a change. People other than yourself. Like the women you slept with behind your wife's back. You were always so confident you had covered your tracks. Always confident your wife actually believed your fervent denials? Part of you must have known she would find out.
Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little time. For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind her back.
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
You can trust me. Your wife is dead and you need to move past that. And the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it, not around it. Surrender yourself to your wife's death. Let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side. It's the only way you can become whole again.
What do you mean?
You.
Really?
God. Sometimes you can be such an animal. Other times you are the ultimate tease...
It's getting hot in here.
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
WHAT?!
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
I know a guy who only has one leg.
Hey, do I look crazy? I don't go for that shit... interviews, media. They're manipulators. " Keep a low profile, " that's my motto.
Come on, John, don't be an asshole. I don't like heights.
In private. They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
That's close enough. It's a confession. The truth. Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante. I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
I never really thought they'd go for it. And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record... I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
The bathroom! For two days?
You should go in. You're risking your life again...
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John. It's a goddamn mess an'I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an'the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions. Looka those maniacs, willya? They love you, for Chrissake!
Great! You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump. Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards.
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being around them if you know what I mean. There you go, you inspire this kid to live. I probably woulda vomited on him.
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
But there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie. Almost half.
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee. She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph. She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right? Just keep me outta prison.
That's good enough for me. You better take that " letter " there and get rid of it.
There was this kid there saying, " Go in there and save my father, mister. " And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
So now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard. Everyday you gotta be everybody's hero. People watching you all the time. Waiting for you to make... a slip. Slip up.
Bail, for Chrissake! I'm innocent!
I know what he means. I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day. I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake! Maybe I " augment " my income a little with some " business deals, " maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator. You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
He gives a good report and I walk?
Yeah, I been calling in sick. They think I got the flu.
A son, yeah. What about him? Joey.
Involved! Christ! She attached my goddamn paycheck! Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer? You know what I mean. Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
Often, uh.
Uh, his birthday, uh, May. I think.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse. The D. A. is asking your bail be set at twenty five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
You whaaaaaat? You paid it? You gave a bondsman ten percent?
That fake inspired you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job twenty five hundred goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna do time! You're s'posed to be an attorney for Chrissake! You're s'posed to have good judgment!
Hey, you could call me " Bernie, " forget the " Mister LaPlante " stuff. You are naive.
TAXI! HEY, TAXI! Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks. TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right? You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer. They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms! Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
Do I hit anybody? You see me shoot anybody? Hey, drugs! Do I sell drugs? Jesus, I don't belong in prison. I'm a family man.
Look, I got this kid. We got a goddamn relationship! I'm takin'him to a movie tonight! He worships me. If I go down what's this do to my son? I'm his goddamn role model for Christ sake!
Business thing. Gimme a seven and seven, willya?
You gotta kid? How old's your kid?
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
We're all assholes, Bernie?
You in business with those guys or what? I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
Yeah, like that. Same thing.
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me? Ya wouldn't, would ya?
Nothin'.
The thing is, Chick. I'm goin'down.
I...
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
Bill, listen...
Bill, I got financial problems and...
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever! You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth
He had an emergency call... a real emergency.
" Elliot "? The heroic goddamn fireman?
Three weeks, Ev. I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
The homeless!
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life. You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
Turn that thing off.
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake? Hey, put that thing down. This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
Here! Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks. How much have you got, Chucky? Give Mister LaPlante your money.
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo? I don't get this. What about...?
" Harassed. " Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo? The guy's a thief, he took my...
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude. I saved your...
Saved your... whaaaaaaat? What? Blackmailing...?
Underbelly!
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie... but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled. Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail. You won't get a cent.
Well, for your child's sake, show some decency then, rise above your sleazy instincts. You may have already killed him!
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Was it you? In the plane? Who saved my life?
Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record. Was it you? Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse? Why?
Oh yeah? A hero, huh? Was he in the'Nam, this guy Elliot?
It was this war. Viet Nam. Doesn't matter.
You never saw that picture, huh?
Me in my uniform. Used to be on the bookcase.
Mmmmm. Well, it's complicated. Maybe when you're older. Anyhow, what I'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence, okay? It don't go no further. What happened is, you remember that night I was gonna take you to the movies an'it was raining like a sonofabitch,..?
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars. I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
Uh, actually... yes... I... should never have come forward and presented myself as
... unworthy of the adoration. We all do.
You did save my life! And it's me! I'd be taking advantage of you! I'm a reporter, John, an experienced professional... I...
Uh, right. A... news story.
Goodnight, John.
Read it. It'll be fine.
You're doing fine. You didn't actually lift me though. It was more like you supported me.
There, like that. Kind of, uh, sexy. You can support me anytime, John.
I just remembered. You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
You do?
Hey, listen, great that you're a career fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
This guy LaPlante won an award?
LaPlante!
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
That too.
Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
A Silver Mike! You're covering us in glory!
We're gonna feature Gale's cast more. The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story. But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
He's not supposed to be an actor, that's the whole point. He's a real life hero, all he has to do is act like a real life hero. That's the beauty of the concept, the whole freshness of it. Did she call him back?
We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings.
Listen, Gale, I know you're emotionally involved. Don't be emotionally involved, be professional. No, Gale, you are not a hardbitten, cynical hard ass, you just think you are. You are a goddamn cream puff! Try and be a hard ass!
Helluva story!
The Presidency. The public loves him.
The " unknown hero. " They found his shoe right beside the plane crash.
I... I saw him out the window.
It's when you say, " Everybody else cheats why shouldn't I? " But I don't I don't hate him. I... loved him once, Joey. Very much. I just got... tired. Maybe it wasn't all his fault. He... What's happening? Oh, my God...
Hello, Mister Wallace.
I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
" This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News! " Incredible. Unbelievable! For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?'Cause he stole paint?
You didn't... get it on with him?
Reporters don't have hormones?
I didn't ask him.
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you. They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
Safety?
They're great with kids. They love'em. They eat'em up. I'm kidding.
Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle. And God help whoever it is. Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground. Put your faith in that, pal.
I'm Bernard, by the way. Those are cool Reeboks, Neil. They're real new, aren't they?
Where are these toys of yours?
What toys do you have?
Any particular brand?
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
And the rent is okay?
All right then. That's important, isn't it? For you to be in an " up " environment. I'm saying you should literally take that as your base, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished even if you were forced by circumstance something for you to build upon.
And what about work? Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
I'm happy that you're working again. As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
Hospital.
Right. So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
Oh, good well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
When I was a child... I got used to the closets. The boxes. The cabinet under the kitchen sink... with that persistent drip. I used to the smell of the boxes. Wood. Cardboard. I got so I was comfortable there in the dark. Even... even that old refrigerator in the yard. That smelled like rust and decay. It was safe in the boxes. It was when they took me out
That's terrific. Don't be afraid to be demonstrative. You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
As long as you keep remembering why.
The whole disapproval thing. If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you? You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way
On the contrary this is tremendous. I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves and I'm not saying we should, you know, declare ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is
A sense of proportion.
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Oh no I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too. What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right synthesis between us where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
I should.
Right.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself. It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Well, you'll just have to make her understand.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Do you do washing machines, too?
So, you're just kind of a roving
Oh, that's fine.
I bet. Going into people's homes.
You must value your independence.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
Not me, I fell for it right down the line. Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales. He married me because I was pretty.
What happened?
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
It is tomorrow.
Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home.
Aw, okay.
A man? Was it a dream?
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do.
So you don't have anything concrete?
Have you just plain asked him?
And?
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
Don't drive yourself crazy. It's probably nothing.
I could take a cab on the way home.
But there's this psycho. Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with every day. I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!
RUDOLF!
Whew.
Thanks, Mom.
Honey
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
This is the one for us.
I know it's at the high end of our range
But it's what we want.
They don't expect to get what they're asking. Let's make an offer.
You could have a pool to cool off in.
And it's a shorter commute.
Good that's what I was trying to project.
Did you hear what he said?
He made, you know, a remark.
And keep my kids away from his property who the hell does he think he is? Some nice neighborhood.
I know. It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
There's no card or anything.
How long does it have to be a new house?
Neil's still having a bad time at school. I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
Well, what about these? Do you usually put your carbons in your pocket, too?!
Barbara Zelman? I don't believe this!
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having. This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With nothing.
I don't know put'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take away menus.
His secretary just confirmed.
C'mon.
What?
Everything that I've been talking to other people behind his back that's what he called me a back stabber and a deceiver. To him and to the company. He called me a traitor in front of everybody and told me if I wanted to be a VP over at Lowenthal I might as well pack up and go only Lowenthal never showed up for our lunch! It's like everybody got an anonymous poison pen letter or some Do you smell smoke?
That's not the case.
" Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going. "
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
Look, I think we should work things out.
I think it's time I came home now.
This is my house.
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready you think you can survive till then?
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
What did the thermometer say?
What d'you want me to do, Neil? I've told you we'll get another dog. What does EVERYONE want me to do? You want to move back? Huh? Would you like that? Should we all just pack up again and MOVE BACK?!
No man! Go to your room.
Right over here.
Even better.
That's right you got the bill this morning. I put it on your desk.
Uh huh.
My name is Jennifer Hillman. I'm an archaeologist. I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
What?
You don't understand. About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey. A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley. The fourth body we've never been able to identify. All four men died from decapitation. Nash was our primary suspect but he disappeared.
Congratulations.
That's what I figured. Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
Tell me again. Where'd you go?
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
Where have you been for the last seven years?
And Brenda?
No.
You sure?
Get outta here.
I'm sorry about that but I had nothing to do with it.
It's late.
Caution shows wisdom.
We too are brothers, Macleod. In fact, you have more family than you think.
Thomas Cavenaugh. I am a teacher of sorts. Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
Indeed you did. And now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him.
The days of magic are ending. The world is changing.
Sing.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
You?
What else? What else do you hear right now?
Yes.
I see. You don't care about life anymore.
England. There is nothing for me here anymore.
Maybe myself.
As friends always as friends.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
I do not know. I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.
France.
Not long. We should arrive in the morning. Are you going to be alright?
You may be living but this suit is killing me.
Then she should be an excellent dancer.
You.
So, you do this for yourself? What about her? You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod. You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen. You watched her grow old and die and there was nothing you could do.
The only thing you can do. You must end it.
I stood up first.
You always get to go first.
What do you think?
She'll soon be of age.
Agreed.
How?
Different places.
Sometimes.
Because it's the past and things that are in the past are best left there.
I'm leaving in the morning.
Do you love me, Conner?
Then take me with you.
Why are you doing this?
Huge.
Paul. I thought we agreed. No press.
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
No. I'm an archaeologist.
To talk to you.
In the highlands?
I don't think so but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
If it's good advice.
Why? What's going on?
What's going on? Why did he call you Macleod?
Then who's Russell Nash?
I don't know.
You talk to me but you don't answer my questions. I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
Have you ever heard of the Calan?
Why?
Sorry.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
Is it?
Alright. In the shop you mentioned something about
Why don't you tell me.
Why not?
You don't really believe this do you?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern? They were wedged in tight. They couldn't get a grip on them. They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
Yes if they were trying to get in but what if they weren't? What if they were trying to get out?
How could that be? People don't live for three hundred years.
On the back it has
How did you know that?
He is immortal yes but he is not like me. We are the last of our kind. The last of the Calans. I do not know what purpose we were put here for. I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.
Must you fight him?
Sounds very normal.
I know. I know you would not tell me. Loyalty it really is a concept that eludes me. Oh well I shall find him. Time is on my side.
Perhaps but it comes off none the less.
The Kurgan was a pussy.
It was not by choice. A small matter of a mountain falling down on us. We were trapped inside. When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands. What you thought was the end was not. This is the end. We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
You cannot hide from me. You will not stand between me and my destiny. After I have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as I want. Do you know what that means? I can become the President I can become anyone I want. The world will be mine.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
How can that be?
Aye I know, Las and I have never loved anyone more.
And I you. Go now. Let me walk to heavens door alone.
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
What will you do?
I don't know. He is the stronger one. He has a power
Did they? You are only a man, different than most but still a man. You feel the same want the same. You want to live.
And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
Don't shout, Larry. I'm three feet away.
The mother is in Florida visiting her sister. The father works at home, so he's probably inside.
I guess so.
I will, Chief. Absolutely.
I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house.
Bullshit a man will do anything to save his family. Who's running the show up there?
I guess not.
No way. I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there.
You're not goin'anywhere! Get on the fuckin'floor!
Bullshit!
Shut up! Shut up and get on the floor!
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.
What if he's dead? What if you killed him?
We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one.
We should give up. All we're doing is making it worse.
It's about Mars
I was there, Dennis! I saw! It's like he wanted to shoot that cop.
Not if they're looking at something else.
There is no way out.
Celebrate what? Going to prison?
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it. He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights. He's probably planning it right now.
Kevin, you're so fuckin'stupid...
That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin'killed!
Fuck you. I'm running this shit. You talk to me.
They're fine.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis. He died.
Dennis? I want you to release those people.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
I'll give you these people.
I gotta piss real bad.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Let me come get him.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again. If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
Give up.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV. Look at him.
I'm getting a doctor!
Look at him! I think he's dying!
We're trapped in a house.
Find something, Kevin. Don't just stand there. And tie this bastard, too. I don't want him waking up and goin'Rambo on us.
We don't have time!
Fuckin'A.
Shit! That fuck! Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up! Did he take the kids with him?
Jesus, get upstairs and find out! If he took those kids, we're fucked!
Have Louise run the name'Mars Krupchek'through DMV and NCIC. Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier.
You have his address?
He has a wife and kid. That's how we'll get to him.
We have to own this guy, Marion. We don't want him dead; we need to use him.
An hour, tops. Might be sooner.
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
I don't know. Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out. He's fucking us over, Glen. That guy is fucking us over.
Canyon Country.
I have your fucking family. Don't forget that.
Fuck that! You think I'm crazy?!
You got ten minutes. If you're one minute late, we won't be here to find.
Close.
I still see that boy's eyes.
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
Mine, too.
No! I'm not going to leave Daddy with them!
I'm not gonna leave you!
Better than you getting killed! Don't touch that gun! Daddy says
Mommy won't know. You can do anything you want right now. Mommy won't know.
Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you. Which do you want?
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder. Can't you make Dennis see that?
I can't go without Thomas.
How can we get out?
Yes.
Holster your guns!
Keep your head down.
He. Can't. Answer.
I need to talk to him. Alone.
Where are they?
Get everyone out here. Then call the Sheriffs. Tell them we have a possible hostage situation.
It's a crank, Louise. C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
Maddox! You got that?
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs. The whole place would go up.
That's why you get the big bucks, Captain.
They have security cameras. Rooney would see you coming.
No. He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
I'm not stupid! You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out
Then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance! What is going on?
Don't be funny, Chief. You can't afford it.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
What's my name?
I asked you my name. You just saw my commission slip. What's my fucking name?
Think of me that way and you won't fuck up. I'll handle the Sheriffs.
What does he have on you? I know why I'm doing this, but what does he have on you?
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath! He kills people!
Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later!
How about you and your sister?
Where are you right now?
I think so.
Okay.
What do you want me to do?
He has lots of disks.
Dennis won't let me go to the desk. He makes me sit on the floor.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
I can get into the den. The office is right across the hall.
Look for names. Does it say whose taxes they are?
Charles G. Benza. They're coming!
Then you have everything. You can put them away.
That would be Glen Howell. He was on his way for the disks.
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
A delegation.
Excuse me?
Leave it to me.
We are looking for you.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
Of course.
How much?
Ten thousand francs for each one.
Six.
I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U. N.
Very good.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul.
 You cannot kill them all.
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
You  re drunk.
Of course.
Very soon.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
The fog is too heavy, sir.
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Good for you. We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but...
Can we phone them in, Paul?
I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
Also, this is your bill for the last week.
Your brother's here?
Let's have dinner first.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
You could have asked for a favor.
They do not have your connections.
I tried already. The phones do not work.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
They know you are Tutsi!
What!
Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
I'll try.
How can we help him.
Give him time.
We have been abandoned.
I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
Do as I say. I will be there soon.
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
I had you transferred to Kigali.
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
It was substantial.
A car.
What does it matter.
A Volkswagen.
Please, please try one more time.
No.
I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump.
I have to go to the Diplomat.
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
That is why they call it coach?
You have taken business class?
What! Paul storms off.
How much beer?
Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
As the trucks go.
The staff and guests! How many?
Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Who is this Simon?
On the street.
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
I don't know.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
No need for divorce and that messy division of assets thing when they kick before you do.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection
" But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw... " well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him
Or might turn out to be very big surprise that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your " demise. "
It's complicated. But don't worry
Not yet.
Price killed her, there's no other explanation
Bullshit
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Problem? No problem just want to get my money and get on home you know, things to see, people to do?
If you don't calm the hell down I'm gonna strap you in for electro shock!
I'm sure you did.
Excuse me?
Can't imagine by who. I don't suppose the truth would interest you: that I've never had another wife but Evelyn.
Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody
You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
Well, let's hear it for small miracles
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Okay I'll admit it: I'm totally, clinically insane. But I'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight. It's yours if you just get me the hell out of here now.
The second the sun hits tomorrow morning. Assuming you have stayed the entire night and you're still alive, of course. Any other questions?
Prove it how?
Don't push it.
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit
You need to get out more.
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V. P. of
Why not?
There's always exceptions.
And then where are we?
It's a thousand years old we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage the sucker'll pop!
No. The basement the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there
You're starting to sound like Pritchett.
Where the hell were you?
Everyone that was invited is related to one of the staff who was here when the place burned. There are five of us...
What about that other guy?
All the plates sealing the windows and doors there's got to be some way of raising them manually. They didn't just appear out of thin air there's got to be pulleys, cables or something, that make them go up and down.
What
Better put it on hold'til we find Pritchett.
The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow dryer and a dream.
I'm not laughing, Steven.
Haven't they already?
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu fucking lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
Then who are they?
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
All accidents until proven otherwise.
You know everything you do gets me hot.
I know.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
Oh, no no no much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch
In the act.
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide or did you just flat out kill the little bitch
And who's next on your list?
Oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here
Thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table!
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
What... are... you... going... to
Wit... nesses
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
I was in the middle of
Well, here's a better one: you're fired.
And here's your goddamn severance!
Your roller coaster that is, quote: " unlike any that has ever come before it. "
I think it's something better experienced then described.
Even if I give you a million as well?
I remember... it was a long time ago... my father said: when the House was finally completed, make sure... we christen it with this bottle of dirt cheap champagne that should still be in a cupboard somewhere!
What're you talking about?
I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
Fascinated.
I'll take my chances.
I'll take the chance, come morning and cops, I'll be proved right
Please! I need your help.
So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
Rewind that.
Then who did??
It works.
No. Somehow I don't know how she did it.
Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War.
He must've beaten us all here!
Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.
Pritchett, this " lockdown " thing it's gotta have like a master control you know machinery, gears, whatever somewhere in this place?
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find reverse on this thing and floor it.
Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here or it's spend the night sleep tight.
And you think it's in there?
Pritchett, what is this " core of darkness "?
Excuse me?
How, he's supposed to be dead!
For the love of God.... please...?
Sara...?
Something.... happened
Something horrible... I don't understand
These records only go back to 1880. But...... wait a minute...
Colleen.
We don't have proof of that.
I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously. And who died here.
No, I live about in Wexford. It's about a five hour drive.
I have to admit I was skeptical. Until now.
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
How's your arm?
There's no need to be.
By freeing them.
The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed.
Well then who did?!
Who... is Colleen?
What about all my other stuff?
She's here.
She's hiding.
I want this one, daddy.
Why?
Did you ever see a leprechaun?
Daddy, please!!!
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't. I'll have to call her.
Must be...
Oh come on...
What will Aubrey think?
Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura. It's over. You know that.
Not really. She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so and so who lives in Ireland. I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
It's not going to work. I'm too smart for you.
Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly. I just want to...
No.
Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event
I don't know what I'm saying.
Well what do you think it is?
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something. Who knows? I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
Who?
Oh come on!
I'm being realistic. Look, I have a spiritual side. I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house. That should count for something.
A friend?
Good. I'll start bringing things in.
Aubrey?! Aubrey?!
No. You two are the most important things in my life. I don't ever want to lose you.
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
Not going! Are you out of your mind?! Wait!
What do you mean, unfortunately?
What about the other five percent?
Maura.
May I come in?
In her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here. She would call me, and I would come by.
The blood of a woman is birth, life. It is part of the ceremony. Seamus offers up the pin Maura waits a beat, then takes it
Perhaps I'll see you in church.
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me. I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there. It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
What's going to happen?
Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.
Not someone. Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
I see some faint lettering. It appears to be the... Runic alphabet?
There's something through that wall!
I don't know! Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall!
Right. Like last night's doozie.
And I believe what you say. But this is TV. No pictures, no story.
You'd lose the money shots. No. I'll catch a bus. Or a cab. Don't worry about it. Go.
That is the story of my life.
Doc?... Doc... Hello?
It's... I don't know. First World War, right?
Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey. And we have to stop it. I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true. Will you walk with me a while?
The cusp of my life. What I was, what I am, what I will be... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision. I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
What will he do? What does he want?
What can we do?
This is his first night on Earth. He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back. He has to destroy it.
Your apartment.
Joey. Yeah, who is this?
Oh yeah. Yeah. Well... Look, I'll make a deal with you... My boyfriend threw me out, right? I'll trade you. You give me couch space. I'll give you talk. OK?
No. No. It's fine. Come now. I was having bad dreams anyway.
Oh yeah...
Why are you so interested?
No. No, it's OK. I... It's my father.
God, no! Nothing like that. No, he died before I was born. He died in Vietnam. I never knew him. Never met him. We don't even know the details. I dream of battlefields. Of searching. Of trying to find out.
What?
I know what you're saying but... Never? You've never had a dream? No, you know, you do. You must. What you mean is you don't remember them.
Oh, go on. Have one. Fuck it. You think you're going to live forever?
But I don't know anything! Really. I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street. He...
No. I'd seen him in there a few times before. He was just a punk. I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief. He must've taken it from the statue.
The thing! He was lying there in the street, moaning. But he pointed at it... 22
Yeah! That's what I'm saying! And it was lying next to him. And he pointed at it before he passed out and...
That's what I'm trying to tell you!...
Ha! I don't know yet. First time. Kitchen virgin, that's me.
No! No, that's OK. I like to. I love boiling water. It's a specialty of mine. Why don't you go watch cartoons?
Jeez, I've never owned anything. I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old.
Cool. I read a book once. It was like all these people discovering who they used to be. You know, like reincarnation? It was really good. You ever read that?
Every day.
No. He knows it won't. It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
Yeah. I found it. I knew held like it and I figured...
No. JP. My last boyfriend? He like owns the club. You know? You were there? He bought the statue.
Sure. Why?
What on earth were you doing down here?
Oh, Terri...
Here! Here! Pull over!
Everything sold as is. No guarantees. No returns.
I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business. I...
It was part of a job lot. Some loony bin they shut down. Unclaimed stuff.
Sure. Just papers, photos. Stuff nobody'd ever want.
You gonna buy?
Right at the back there. Middle shelves. Coupla folders. Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
Uh huh.
Thank you.
It's yours. You won it. It's a prize.
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring...
He's a barman. Whatever. Do you mind if I continue?
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar. And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
Don't do that! Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
No. Thank you.
You shit. Who do you think you are?
You... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard! You get me in here...
Yes.
No! No. It's not the same... I... No. What you did... it was... evil.
Because you want to. You've always wanted to. Look at your pictures. Look at your sculptures. Look at those tawdry representations and then... Imagine. Imagine a world of the body as canvas. The body as clay. Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you.
God? My God was diamond and black light. And I was his Dark Pope. All that is changed. A terrible beauty is born. With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
JP?
What do you want?
Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Well... I'm fine. Things are great here. Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station. I'm meeting lotsa new people. It's really great.
Yeah really. I'm...
You're apologizing?
Well... of course I have. I've thought. I've... Oh, JP, you were so horrible. You really hurt me...
I miss you too.
Yes. 53
Oh, I don't...
Yeah... yeah, it looks different.
A girl? Anyone I should know?
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me. You know that. It was my fault, babe, it really was. And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now. I hate to see you in pain like this.
Well, forget about it. Hawk and I are going to Rio. We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich. Right, buddy?...
Lousy day? The man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day. What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant? Believe me, it's overrated.
My next word was gonna be " consciousness. " Swear to God... tubby.
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Not anymore. Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's. Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino. What the hell's a Nintendo?
Hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino. I gotta go be a boss.
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing? Where's the want ads? Gonna sell some spatulas.
You're not... LISTENING!
You know they invented something while you were inside. Called a watch.
" You could be swinging on a star. "
Geez, Gates was killed. Who do we send the thank you note to?
" Attempted. " At tempt ted! I'm not happy about having to steal that horse, but I do have my pride. Face it, when it comes to burglary, and sex, I....
Because I'm tired of not understanding things. Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal it's fucked up.
Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense. Where's your tux?
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of my life. What was your per diem?
Yeah, I mean, come on, going through the Iron Curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire, it's supposed to be strangling a guard...
Okay.
You can be lookout!..... Take Alex's gun.
You're a reed, man. I gotta get Anna. Hang in there...
Get em....
My plan is just beginning. I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
Attempt, you mean. The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk. The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists. We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey. Must you flirt with him so realistically?
Let me be the one to quote Scripture..... As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations. Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Anna, what are you trying to say...
Sorry. Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
I'm going to find out.
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say " God go with me. "
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress. A polite push, perhaps? A clear shout of " watch out, Anna " would have done nicely...
Question, sir? His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank.
Could you believe that crazy elephant?
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
Oh, you read that.
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
God, I wish I could say the same thing. What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
Said.
I was the Warden?
Let's just say, I never saw E. T.
I seem to have a thing for sinning. sinning. Check please....
It's also been a long time for me. I
Oh. No.
Wha
The C. I. what? God, no...
I work for a covert Vatican humanitarian organization. The CIA made a fool of me. I care for you...
It's from the machine. All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2 / 3 of it already. We can't let that happen.
Selfish attitude? I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
Fits my new image. A thief for the masses. This is one job I'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying. Gum.
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
Wha.....
Wha you don't want to know...
I got my planet back.
And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... Is that it?
Anna. Anna. Anna. If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex. Now, get some sleep. Kit Kat...
Bunny, ball ball! Bad bunny!
Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.
So let's get busy. Have some fun and make some deals.
Million five, lover...
Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.
Oh... Let's see. There are organizations that think we wanted the " Sforza " for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand. We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved. I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
Way to go, Alfie! How many people did you break that thing in front of. Good help's hard to find.
Remember that shoe you lost...
So when's that Sebastian Cabot Buckingham Palace looking Butlerhead getting here?
You wouldn't risk the dime to call the police. You have no proof.
Except yours yours. The goal of world domination. Well, if you put it that way, Minnie. How can I resist?
I killed some lovable working class Italian diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover. So don't play with me.
Tonight? You're whacked. The timing's off, I'm underequipped Damnit, I have a date!
Just shut up and hit me!
Bastard, you're going to need another nose!
To what do I owe the dishonor of a reunion, you centrally intelligent scumsicle.
Hush. My employer wants a meeting.
No, somebody powerful. Oh. Look. what's that up there?
Shucks. Guess not.
God, I miss communism. The Red Threat. People were scared, the Agency was respected, and I got laid every night.
If you do anything to my friend...
I don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie.
The Jerky Circle!
Snappy.
The Shazzammeter!
The Hoop dee doo!
But who are you what d'you do here?
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
That smart?!
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
An'only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things'bout things she, uh when she don't, uh How'd that go?
Why you don't even know y'own self you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin'to be such a hard ol'sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin'happy.
Okay, Miss Archuh.... I got gears to see to.
Lumbago.
A sawbuck!
On Norville Barnes!
Muncie!
The couch, please.
At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world
Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
Please! Norville!
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you'Miss'because you seem to have'missed'the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change'guts'to'courage.'No, make it'common decency.'These wild speculations about my intelligence
These preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! But I doubt it. I most seriously doubt it. As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales, a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours sincerely, et cetera.
I'm sure I
Well, I
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Well, it's done now what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam...
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Oh, is that it!
Smitty.
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Let me look.
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
... You do?
I believe in you, Norville At least I believe in your... intentions
Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
... Huh?
Oh yes! In Muncie!
Uh Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I well no, I I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it why don't you come there with me they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
Well this year if it's good I plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my it certainly is beautiful
What a beautiful thought.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
Sure, Norville, sure...
Never mind about that...
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families
You mean you know about this?
Your i
You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of would you get out of here?!
Shutup! and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile
Shutup! but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after
Shutup! after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
Huh?!
Hey! Where's that martini?!
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
As a three dollar bill.
Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...
I filed it yesterday.
It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
I've got an even hotter story The Sap from the City Desk.
It's about a dimwitted editor who
Amy take a break. You've worked hard on this story heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack.
I thought you served misfits here!
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin'ya
Martinis are for squares, man.
This you're familia'with.
Forty four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
Waring Hudsucker! Na ha ha ha ha! Say, buddy!
Waring Hudsucker! Na ha ha ha ha! Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's'wearing'Hudsucker! Na ha ha ha!
Nobody wants a hare brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here
I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
An example must be made!
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin'to ya!
... It is?
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he
But, Buzz
But, Buzz, you know I never
But Buzz
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls to the wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
It's sittin'in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile.
Geez, I
Yessir.
Sir?
Yes sir...
' Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a'success.'How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes
But look, I'm president of the company now and I
I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep, Miss. That's why I touched you farthest from your heart.
Thank you, Alma.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
I do my best. Every day I dress her just as beautifully as if she was well. It's just like dressing a great, big doll.
Looks like an awful lot of breakfast I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
There are other doctors... Yes, other doctors... Better doctors...
At the Houmfort.
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy. Mama Rose was mindless. I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
No. She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica. But the Houngan cured her.
Yes, Miss Betsy. I mean that. The Houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to Shango and Damballa.
A man, miss an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
No, miss. He's just as he was in the beginning on the front part of an enormous boat.
If you say, miss. And the enormous boat brought the long ago Fathers and the long ago Mothers of us all chained down to the deep side floor.
If you say, miss. If you say.
Ti Joseph?
Come, come, don't tell me how sorry you are that I should meet you this way. I'm even a little glad that Wesley's difficulty brought us together.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
Haven't I? I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
A missionary's widow? It isn't very likely, is it?
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level headed girl. What are you driving at?
Her son drowned. She brooded until her mind was affected. All the Houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology.
But, Mrs. Rand
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
Perhaps not. But I did come here and I found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started, it seemed such an easy way to do good. I should have known there was no easy way to do good, Betsy.
Mrs. Rand was at the Houmfort that night. But there's nothing wrong with that. She's gone there for years trying to take care of those people, to help them.
Where were you trained?
That is good. But I'd like to know more about the case.
That will mean another interview, won't it?
The West Indies?
But it's so far away...
And that chair is the particular property of Mrs. Rand mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
No she just runs the place. She's everything else amazing woman, mother. You'll like her.
And that is my chair. And this is Miss Connell who is beautiful.
My brother's wife.
I wondered about your different accents. I'm still wondering about your names Rand and Holland.
Yes, the redoubtable Paul. He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
Well and things might be a better description of what you'll find. I'd better come along and show you the town.
What in the world are you talking about? Six ounces?
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
That doesn't sound like him.
I'd like to go now, Rand. Would you mind taking me home?
She hated sleep. She used to say it was a thief stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
You know what she is! That's death no mind, no senses no love, no hate, no feeling nothing!
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand. Those flying fish they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror. Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence. There's no beauty here it's death and decay.
A figure of St. Sebastian.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
Why should you be? My wife is a mental case. Please keep that in mind, Miss Connell particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about Zombies.
Many people thought her beautiful.
I've never given it much thought.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
It's always stood there, Miss Connell. I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
I'm afraid the decanter will have to stay where it is. I engaged you, Miss Connell, to take care of my wife, not my brother.
I know what you went through tonight. I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
I don't know. I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how.
What you saw tonight two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband? Do you love that?
Didn't I? I don't know. That's the simple truth of it. I don't know.
Instead you come, with sympathy, Betsy, and a generous heart. Don't forget that. Don't call it nothing.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort. I thought they might cure her.
I told you.
You know why. You saw it the other night at the piano. You turned away from me.
I hated her.
You can't believe that. You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad. You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
I can understand that. Everyone feels that way about someone.
Don't, Paul don't doubt yourself don't make me doubt you.
That's past that's over and done with...
You want that?
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
Because he drove Jessica insane deliberately coldly!
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Ben you know that's your territory and I wouldn't dream to trespass you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Right o'.
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
Yeah, good.
In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.
Gotcha.
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
I did, but somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that " I'm OK. You're OK " stuff you keep babbling about you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and
Elena.
What do you think?
Rough day. Good night.
Um, yes.
I... I think I am...
Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to
Whatever that means Elena And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
Hell, I know. I I guess if you want to accuse me, you've got Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot.
What?
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
Yeah, that one.
No advice from the experts, huh?
I have no idea.
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
Don't be dim.
I'm not surprised.
Your unfaithfulness that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
It's a starting place.
If you're going to insult me
Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.
That this was going to be a key party?
Well?
Damn it, Ben
You're not going to
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
I'll drive you
We'll talk in the morning.
Yeah. Well, we can just
I'm fine dad.
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments
Classes?
Grades?
Anyone special? You know...
Well it's good to see you we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
You know Paul, I've been thinking, maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk, you know, about well
All the more reason for this little heart to heart... great.
Thanks.
Libbets? What kind of name is Libbets?
Yeah?
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
Gotcha.
In a bit.
Yeah, but, I I've been working a lot lately, and No, that's not it. I guess we've just been on the verge of saying something, whatever it is, just saying something to each other. On the verge.
Right. Gotcha.
What are you talking about?
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry
What you been up to?
What do I think? I think you're probably touching each other. I think you're touching that reckless jerk off, for god's sake, and I think he's trying to get into your slacks. I think, at fourteen years of age, that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
I mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess...
Well what am I supposed to call you?
You know, dah
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each
What advice? You never
73
But I well maybe I love her. Elena.
It was all junk!
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
It's what?
Darn it, Dave.
You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L. A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it. Actually, I didn't think about it at all, really.
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right
Jesus, let me make it up to you I can do better than that, honestly
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
Of course.
Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.
Phone's out. I hope the pipe's
Who?
Mikey Williams?
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
Oh Wendy.
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
I suppose. Why?
What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
I insist. Don't touch them.
Of course.
I used to know how to cook.
How'd you know?
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown
None at all. I'll leave it in front of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving.
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
No need to make excuses
Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion at times it's the disorganization that's liberating and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples
Forget what?
And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
You ask what the point is?
Self realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self realization?
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean... My, I sound a bit
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
Now you are being rude.
Ouch.
That I will indeed.
I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben  Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
Where you going?
Flame on, asshole.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
What?
What do you mean?
Shit. You're not planning
All will be revealed, baby.
One for you and one for me.
Howdy there. You, young knight. Can you check on the mead? Can you sally forth and secure us some more mead?
Just be careful.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Would it matter? And what's that?
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
Play with the whip.
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
The Idiot.
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
My what?
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
And I have a feeling for you too, because you're just like I feel for you like you're you're just like
Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
Truly? Do speak.
How do you know this shit?
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
Good thinking Marge.
No one.
Geometry?
It's freezing.
I'm chewing.
There's a TV in the basement.
Why did you with Sandy?
You like him? He worships you.
4: 30 movie. When Worlds Collide.
You get in trouble?
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
I have not touched your sh Stuff. You watching this?
Nixon, doofus! It's incredible. He should be shot.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
It's a one on one kind of date thing.
Her name's Libbets.
Is this Charles?
Um, ten o five. Why? Where are you?
And?
Right.
I have plans.
Mikey was looking for you.
All my model planes.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m 80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
Yeah.
Just thought I'd stop by.
Yeah.
No.
He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
They left it in the jungle.
You never tasted the stuff?
Okay.
That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream.
I don't know. How do I know?
It's all about the small stuff. Small lies. Small mistakes. Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case. It's human nature.
Do it again.
Good. He's up next.
Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet. We can get it in by the morning editions.
Who's playing?
That must have been awful for you.
How much closer would you say you were?
Five feet? Seven feet?
Byrd's dead.
He would have liked that.
That's why I'm here. I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
Anything. It's important.
We'll get the other one, though.
Like I said, no. We know about those things up here.
Around twelve thirty.
I beeped you over two hours ago.
So?
What happened at that signing?
Did she?
That boyfriend. Randy.
You know my plan of action.
That's right.
He's asking everybody questions.
He's just rattling your cage.
We say nothing. It goes away. Simple as that.
One word to I. A. and he walks.
No way.
Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap! We are nothing like Mike Flynn. We did what we needed to do to make sure that son of bitch Dobbs paid for what he did. And every bastard like him. We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk. Every last one. And I am not going to let that happen. No deals. No compromises. No discussions.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
I'm not expecting anyone.
What did he look like?
There's a guy down the hall. Complaining about the noise. Says he can't sleep.
Kay Connell. Did you love her?
You heard me that time.
But she was seeing someone else on the side.
Stuff.
Just stuff. I don't fucking remember.
I told you I don't remember.
How should I know?...
Fuck you, man! I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
She didn't tell me.
What are you doing in this shit hole town?
Since grade school.
We were like sisters. Knew everything about each other.
Told each other everything. That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?
She wouldn't tell me!
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here. Leave us all behind. That he was going to take her!
My arm!
She used some stupid code name.
Brody... I don't know...... Something Brody!
Oh?
Thought you might find that.
I suppose.
I was a mentor to her.
Expensive dresses. A heart necklace.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
Congratulations.
But we work so well together...
Don't you pull that shit with me.
If you want it to be...
You're not following procedure.
Your lips, they didn't move.
But how did you come into existence?
If there were a leader, I would be the one.
What are we?
Who made us what we are?
But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
No.
Perhaps...
I have not spoken to him...
None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world.
Knew? You mean he is...
No, my beloved, my child.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
But why?
Then blame the one who made her...
We want no quarrel with him.
Then I leave too.
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
How he must have loved you.
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you
Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
I understand you only too well. You let them do it, as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon. As I let her rip Lestat's heart to pieces! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. Your melancholy spirit of this century! I know what I must do. And i warn you you saved me tonight, so I return the favour do not go near your cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again.
And yet you knew what I would o.
You were their leader. They trusted you.
We are a pair, and that's what counts.
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
Is this my birthday?
But you're the fairest by far.
And if I cut my hair again?
But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
Not you my dear.
What plans?
Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
We forgive each other then?
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
Why does he call you that?
Why not?
You both did it?
The swamp...
I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free.
I can't bear it when you do I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.
Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love?
But how will I ever know, Louis?
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
Come, Claudia...
I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
Let him go, he said. Let him go.
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
It's only mortal death.
What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
You want death? Is it death you want?
NO!!!!!
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
Call him.
You've just done it
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.
You asked for death. I didn't promise it
Forget the crucifix. Take him.
Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.
The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle
Read her thoughts.
The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along.
As did the one who made me.
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
What do you imagine you are Louis?
Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!
That and more.
Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.
You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
I didn't want to kill her.
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
And they frighten you?
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
Yes. I remember...
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
You followed me here, didn't you?
It's just a room...
I'm a vampire.
Well, what a lucky break for me.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty four younger than you are now.
But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...
You can't look at them...
The story about stakes through the heart?
What about coffins?
You loved your wife, surely.
Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps in the end he did it to show me that he could. For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine...
And did you lose her? Did she go?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.
Don't say anymore. The reels are still turning. I have but one chance to show you the meaning of what I've said.
And you know what you ask for?
A child who can't die...
Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.
Wait... Did you say off season?
Sorry. Emergencies only.
I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts. All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.
We haven't exchanged anything.
No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be psyched.
The guy looks dead.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
I just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
No means yes.
Okay, okay. You're right.
But, he said he'd try.
He does work hard.
Then, don't.
I also promised Tyrell.
I miss Ray... I tried to call him.
Okay, I won't.
No.
Not me... no way...
It's too late for that.
... Nancy?
Is he?
Yeah.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good friend thing first.
I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
Never do that again.
That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise. Wanna dance?
Ben Willis.
You never do... The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this
You sure?
You don't seem fine.
I'm sorry.
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
I'm trying. I really am... Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
Right. Now I remember.
Are you sure?
I said, this... Do you want a drink?
Deep breaths
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
What do you mean, Julie?
No it's not that. It's... I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
I wasn't dreaming.
I guess so.
I trusted you.
Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
' Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh kill? How'bout Freddy, Jason?
Alone. In the room. Got any advise?
Well, I'm in school and
Yes!
No. Yes?
Well, there's some flaws in her...
Wanna drink?
He leave you?
Cool.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up. I've never seen a dead body before.
Crowded.
Hey shut up, okay?
I'll go find him.
This was the temple of Hades the God of the Dead. It contained no images just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
The Greeks thought death was beautiful an adventure a journey to another world. But I have my other guests to think of The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me
It is my home. My name is Hugo Albrecht.
He's dead. I want the General to see him.
I'll go up and take a look at the General  perhaps sit with him.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
Well  
Thank you, I'll do that. Good night.
But why?
I'm afraid so. There were rumors   people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
In the meantime it would be useless to alarm the others. Let them think it was a normal And, perhaps it was  perhaps it was.
Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
Maybe you're right. Help me get something to carry her downstairs.
Thank you.
Closer and closer  until they bite into your throat!
Last night Dr. Drossos today you or I oh, no, Oliver, it can't be you, I couldn't stand it.
How old is she?
Shh    it's all right  I'll be all right.
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind  or just because he is one's father?
What is it what are you talking about?
The General  you don't even know him.
I will let him go. He is dead to me as he is to all my mother's people. I turn my hand against him.
She is dead  at peace.
We quarreled. She never dared get angry or frightened but I said things to her it was an attack, I know it was.
Theodosia.
Damn me, if I know. She's become so much a member of our household I never think of her by any name but Thea she has a last name
What is her illness?
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
I will go with you.
In the New York Morning Globe, the man who wins victory is always a hero.
You were at those battles as a spectator   I wonder if you can think what that sound might mean to me   those men out there   dead or dying   by my order because I willed it so.
I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl  
I know all you are going to say  I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife  there is something about her   the way she moves   the way she turns her head.
It is not necessary to understand. We are leaving and I am thankful.
The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what to do then.
I don't know. When I was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away with them. Months later she came back   pale sick she died
I had a notion you had become self  appointed chaperone lately  why?
And I'm your friend   but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
That's ridiculous Thea's lovely, gentle 
When you make sense I'll listen.
I shall not leave the island  
Everything's so simple. I like you.
Don't let it trouble you. He's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. He won't harm you.
Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble   the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory cooped up here waiting for death naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.
Well, tell, him.
Why in the world can't you?
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
All I'm asking is thirty days more...
I can't do that. These families have children.
Well, all right...
Sure I have, but I got rid of it.
The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder.
Hurry up... hurry up... hurry up.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
We're all excited around here. My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Well...... now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.
Go through with what?
Oh, no.
Clarence Odbody, A S 2.
Angel, Second Class.
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you...
Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You...... wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea. What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right. You've got your wish. You've never been born.
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow   you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
You don't huh? Well, you got any money?
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
Where's Mary?
I don't know how you know these things, but tell me   where is she?
I'm not supposed to tell.
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
I know that girl!
Hi, Bert.
Yeah   yeah   hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.
Mother? What do you want?
Today, over at the house.
I won a flower.
All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink.
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
It will?
Fine.
Old college graduate now, huh?
Yep.
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge.
A cattle boat?
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
Please don't go away   please!
You're not paid to be a canary.
Anything I can do back here?
Mr. Gower, I think...
Yes, sir.
Oh, it's wonderful.
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
Well, no younger than I was.
How's that?
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about   build things... design new buildings   plan modern cities   all that stuff I was talking about.
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
I hope it works.
Did you get a doctor?
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
Do me a favor, will you, George?
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Hello, what am I bid?
Where are you going?
Then we can go up to the falls. It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it. Then we can climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the pines, and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and... we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking and there'll be a terrific scandal...
I know, but...
Now, let's hear from you...
I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know. Well, I've said too much. I... You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in   providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow...
Well, what about all your other friends?
I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
You don't like coconuts! Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? Lookit here   from Tahiti   Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!
Well, I don't.
Me?
Uh uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
Okay   what can we lose?
Well, why don't you say it?
Eighteen.
Too young or too old?
Ummmmm...
Uh huh.
If I told you it might not come true.
How's that?
About what?
I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by...
Where'd you get that dress?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
No, I don't want to be rude.
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
No, marriage is all right for Harry, and Marty, and Sam and you.
You know what we're going to do? We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels   the oldest champagne   the richest caviar   the hottest music, and the prettiest wife!
I'll be back in a minute, Mary.
Darling, you're wonderful.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you...... Your what?
Where's your coat and hat?
What is it, a sore throat or what?
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Oh, George, George!
You have no idea what happened...
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Oh, Mom   I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
What?
I want to go faster!
No problem, no problem.
I can't help it it sticks in my mind.
No.
Then why are we futzing around the dock? We can make a few bucks working at the beach.
Shut up.
It's not going to be easy.
What the hell. Did your mom put all this together?
Mostly old garbage. Today we found a'48 Hudson.
We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?
Want to talk about it?
It's okay, it's okay. What's the matter? Tina? Honey? Hey
What is it? What's there?
I need a hand here....
Till noon. This is on my own time. Hi, Shorty.
Then check it out. I'll be in the office.
Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
Rich people. Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
If you had a  100, 000 boat there'd be an investigation.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Positive I. D.?
Oh.
That one from the wreck. You brought it up, did you look inside it?
You got it.
Of course not, They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place. He'll do it for me.
Nine thirty, ten maybe.
Sailing?
What else is there to do?
Do I have to?
Bartending? I'm 17.
Because.
I'll be careful. I'll see y'later.
You heard me.
You want to come here a minute?
Sailing? Forget it. You're beached. Grounded. No more boats.
No backtalk! I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there. You can work until school starts.
It's okay. What happened?
What?
Sure, sure Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother in law, in Montauk, he works at a hi fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny thing. You can't tell much from the negatives, I was going to blow'em up. Here's a test I did....
Let's see you got a minute?
Okay, okay stand over there....
Y'know, Brody for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer. Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
You're damn right that's what it is.
Is that what it is? Dollars? Money? I'll pay for it. Take it out of my salary.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
It means I don't like all that grab ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there and I don't want to go through that horror again. Ever!
The what?
The whale's mouth?
What shark?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Do you?
Okay, so that's it.
What makes you think there might be?
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Probably.
And sound.
Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low frequency vibration.
Not necessarily. These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more. None of them are immediately fatal. Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
Not when it's like this. This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least. Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Don't be ridiculous Sharks don't take things personally.
I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
Because they're playing our song.
I did, I did.
Right.
Good.
So's a donut.
One what? Ah ha!
It's an island. Got to run.
Sort of Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half past next spring.
Santos'place.
Nothing.
That's what I said. Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
No.
In the city, it happened all the time some Kid o. d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies. Call the cops. What are we, immune?
The goddamn smell is always the same.
Yeah. I think so. Mike! Keep it down, for chrissake!
Sean's asleep.
That you were fired.
Because of today? The beach?
Stop that! We're not going any place. You love it here. Tell me what the hell happened!
Honey, this is nothing... I don't know what it is. What did they....
They have no right to treat you like that. You've given them every thing. For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
I know you did....
I'll give notice.
Thank you, thank you. You know my son, don't you?
We're alone.
No one has seen a shark no fin, no bites, nothing. Be realistic.
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
We have done something hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need  800, 000 worth of steel net around their beaches! In New England? We all lost on that one.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
A tragedy. But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up. Are they all shark victims?
What am I, an ass? When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
Don't push it this time. If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that.
Perfect. Look at this
I'm okay, baby, I'm here. It's okay....
I've never been supercargo.
You going to fool around with Mike? Well, I'm not doing anything with him.
I'm not crazy about blind dates.
I want you to meet my cousin.
Great!
Hang on, hang on... Okay, go.
Okay, okay, coming....
Me neither.
Tina Wilcox.
Doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
I know.
I can't stop thinking!
Sideways For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....
With you, everything's next week. I want to go skiing soon. Tomorrow?
Give me back my hat!
What about sailing?
It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful.
What're we going to do in the mean time?
Mmmmmm.
Anything. Anything.
You got it.
All of them. Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy all that whole gang.
Yep. Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.
Happens every season someone takes off. Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting.
I don't care about the overtime, I'm hungry. And cold. And most of all, bored.
Oh, great.
Now you're talking. Let's get out of here before we do find something.
Great. I got some wine.
It'll be fun, come on!
No way. Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
You do everything your parents tell you?
Good. I'll be on the dock at eight. Eight o'clock, everybody!
What about me?
Your ass I will. Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
Not tonight.
How was dive class?
You eat Cheerios. I want Fruit Loops.
You're going sailing.
Take me.
I want to go with you!
Michael....
Oh, shit.
Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get them back in the bus.
So it can't be done like that. The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Go on, you're tired.
It would make a marvelous attraction; the only Great White in captivity.
He's going with you, Doctor.
And Philip will be there to film it. Now that's the end of it!
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
Sure am.
Shit.
Well, don't worry about your fiancee. We'll watch over her.
Never know down there. Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
Me? I don't know. Twenty, thirty. I love them, think they're the greatest.
Till this opens, not our wedding.
You will. I'll see to it.
Pre opening jitters.
Yeah.
My imagination isn't that good.
Okay, bye.
How come?
And what else is bothering you?
Yeah, you really don't like him.
It's his work.
Okay, forget him now. I'm going to pick up Sean. Take a ride?
Sure. Want to try that new Italian place?
Not enough loving.
I don't have a choice.
That's cute, Kathryn. Real cute.
Are you scared?
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
... Friggin'fish.
I know, I built it. I've just never seen it this way.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
You sound like Houston Mission Control. What the hell does it mean?
Swim where? Out there? Oh, no, forget it, not me! You go, I'm staying.
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
And leave me down here???
What mind? If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming! You'd think you're gonna leave me?
I'm okay.
Don't think about it. It's over.
After what happened to us?
Kathryn, you're crazy. Really crazy. A suicidal maniac.
Here.
Bracelets.
Thank you.
Why?'Cause they're hungrier?
You amaze me. I'm more scared than you.
We'll go to Palm Springs, Death Valley, Arizona desert, anyplace where there's no water.
Sean, that's right...
Recovering nicely.
It's my new perfume. Great White, the Man Eater.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow. Would you do that for me?
Yes. It's faster.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way. You're not going to walk all the way around?
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
Michael, I don't have time. Please! It's time you dealt with this and got over it. Now come on!
It's too soon to move him.
I did. He wants it on exhibit.
Michael, take deep breaths.
Come on.
Yes, you can.
So?
What do you mean, we don't?
Thirty feet???
You wanted to know about a cave?
... I have to go, honey. Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
Me.
I am. You're not.
It's a construction job. I'm the only one that can do it.
You don't have to prove anything.
Nobody told me.
They're not tricks. They're behavior patterns.
I don't know. They're nervous and skittish right now.
Wait a minute. These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton. They're dolphins.
I can have them walk backwards.
I told you, something's upset them.
I'm sorry.
That's a load of codswopple. A Great White doesn't fear man. It doesn't fear beast. It's an orgy of food and blood.
That's preposterous!
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack. You know how many are born? Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
Like hell!
What in hell is that?
Let's hope he knows that.
Why?
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Just watch it when he does.
Not at all.
I like it when they wake up.
And I like you.
Some miss all their shots.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
Philip.
That's because I am the shark.
The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey. He knows I have it, so he watches out. Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
Believe me, I am.
He. She. Let's blow the bitch up!
I know.
I should have never listened to Calvin.
We got it to live for ten hours. That's some kind of record.
' Preciate it.
Hope with none of my girl friends.
Thanks.
I'm Neo Senephrened out. Think I'm catching a cold.
I was seeing this guy off. He flew in from Dallas. Wants to marry me. He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
' Course they're also so rich.
How long you staying?
You like Florida?
I'm a water skier.
Sure am.
How come?
As always.
I know! We can take the gondola ride!
Yes, it's great!
Come on, it's fun!
You're not in the water. You're in a gondola.
Sean, this is ridiculous. You're acting very immature.
Goes up.
Take it up.
What're you doing later?
I thought I was your boyfriend.
Shut up, Tod! Be serious!
Gotta sneeze.
Can't help it... ahh...
On monitor three. Was a glimpse of something.
Yes, there is goes.
Yeah, well I didn't!
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year. A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely. Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
I will, old boy, tomorrow. Our work is done here. Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Thanks. Bullshot.
No, South Georgia.
Polar bears.
South Georgia, Antarctica.
The world's southern most reaches.
Tradition. Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries. Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard. What I was born to do.
Reach for the limit I always say.
You have a man near it?
I'll stay out of your way. I won't interfere.
That's impossible.
Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
Look great, don't I?
Yeah, we'll find something for you. Shoveling shark shit or something.
In a restaurant. You sit there and they swim around you.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Yeah, right.
Big bust! He confiscate their water pistols?
That's Dad...
Gee, it's good to see you!
Just find your own. Like Dad says, there's plenty of fish in the sea.
You know Overman?
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding. Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
Sure.
Yeah, right. That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara
Give me a 400 foot magazine; we may be down there for a while.
She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
Don't bother Hoagie....
Not today. Come on, Thea....
I don't want to. I want to swing....
It's time for tea, Grandma.
It was a piece of wood. A shitty piece of wood. It's not fair....
Chicken....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
I'll be right there.
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap. I'm trying to get ready for....
Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....
Turn it off....
Off....
I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder. I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.
Thea was attacked by a shark....
Where is she?
Where's my mother?
Usually it's all he talks about... You mustn't worry....
I used to worry... But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
Henny Youngman....
You're not interfering, Ellen....
I always thought when I grew up I'd know what to do about things like this... I don't even know if he's serious....
Maybe he's got good taste... I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
You make sure they come?
Michael!
We're going down. All of us....
That....
Can't help myself....
Let me finish dinner before you eat it... Chop the peppers....
I'm on the phone....
Good.
I'd like that. I need to be away from here.
I want you to give up that terrible job.
You're damn right I'm serious....
I don't want you in the water anymore....
Dad died from a heart attack....
You were a monkey....
We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go.
You could teach... You could....
You're all I have left... I don't want you going in the water....
He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous....
Will you let me finish. I've been working on this all day.
No more sharks. I'll stay for another week, then....
Children are never satisfied. I have my house, my friends, my job... My life, Michael. I have to live it. Besides, I'll be back. Now show your mother what a good dancer you are.
You look tired....
I'm leaving in a few days. I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
I'm your mother. It's my job....
It's a terrible thing to know some thing no one else wants to believe.
Why'd you take the boat?
I'll wear my rubbers... I'll be careful... I'll be....
You must get bored easily.
I... I can't explain it. It's just something I feel.
It was no accident....
When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart. I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that. I know it's coming....
I can't....
I don't know how....
You're doing fine. I'll keep you out of trouble. Relax....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
You're impossible....
The plane's turning....
I'm terrific... Come on....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
A big one....
All or nothing. You want to roll them for me?
But it gets cold in winter....
I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while....
I like to travel....
I borrow it without telling him....
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean. We could take a few days....
There are... I'm tired of one way conversations....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why. Blushing suits you....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
I'm too young for coffee. Can I drive the plane?
The wind does that. Ever been to the Bahamas before?
I own the airplane. I can do whatever I want. I'm the boss.
Hell, no. What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
Still tagging conch?
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
How's Ellen?
I wish there was something I could do....
Would you talk to her? She's got it in her head that the shark came for him. She still blames it for my father's death....
It was like having snow in the house... Jesus, I miss them.
You too, Michael....
Try the area around the wreck....
You tagging them...?
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots... We've got a schedule... shake it, man....
We'll pass around cigars....
If you'd leave me alone, I'd be able to get my work done....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
I stuck them on, man....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen... They leak....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
Hey!
Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
They won't fight with me....
Money is money....
I know a guy who got money from them to study eels....
You're afraid of the competition out there....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
Spade's a garden tool....
Okay... we're done, man....
When I got the grant.....
When I invited you...
Okay... we got it together....
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas. There's never been one down here before. I'm not just going to let it swim away.
The shark will get it for us.
Shit....
How long have you known Hoagie?
How long?
Who?
I don't remember. One day he was just here....
Half don't... Bring her about....
He gambles... He likes a good time... I see him around....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
I don't like it....
What about Carla's gig?
She's not going to like it....
What about the monitor...? You getting anything on the shark?
How come only me?
Funny, Jake... Funny.
' A Moray eel.... '
' It got us in hot water... We should have been there for Carla.... '
Shove it....
Stop that!
I don't like the song.
You jump, you'll kill yourself....
Theory, partner... If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it... Confuse it... Drive it away....
I forgot my rubber gloves. Let's do it.
It's my fault... I have to....
Jake.
Who grows more beautiful....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
Happy birthday, darling....
I'm not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair.
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous... You should see....
Cow tipping?
I'll take care of it.
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something. Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink. And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot the Chutes. An'you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
Well, with me, it's all right. I'll kiss you and hug you. You see if I don't. Now Mama, Mama, stop now. You're gettin'kittenish. Mama, listen, I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage. You know, with this show. I'm gonna sing it jazzy. Now get this...
The van?
No, my mother's.. You better stop in.. I'm just here to feed the cat.
How about any guys on your staff?
Be my guest. What you got?
Two dogs. He should do the dogs.
What does that mean?
C'mon, just shut your eyes until it's painted. You're gonna love it. This is " God's Country, " John.
There's nothing in the files?
Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10.
Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that " bye bye. " Send it to Sacramento, John.. I sniff grief..
I don't mean this " system " shit that keeps you sucking, I mean stop.. I was exactly like you are.. I used to wake in the night heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit.. If I can stop, you can..
Someone bet me a dollar..
What do you mean, Ross?
Because I dislike her too much..
No you don't. That's how you think you feel about him. That's how you feel about yourself. You won't give yourself one fucking minute for you.
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right.. I knew there was some thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead.. We gotta get back up that dump..
We're going.
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it..
I haven't got it.
Why?
I had one puff on a pipe.
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent imental attachment to that.
They possibly did but they nev er had a head, so they never had a bullet and they never got an I. D. not on any of em never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is we're the first to get a positive identity.
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me? He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
I wanna take that fucking Blind In stitute to pieces.. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years..
We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is " Jennifer Eight. "
I dunno, I daren't go in there just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in mad as hell what are we doing fuck ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators..
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
John, stop it. The case is on its ass, you're closed. C'mon, let it go for once.. Have a drink. C'mon, relax, drink your beer..
You're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break. You're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide?.. Not many people could do that in a place like this.. And you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case?.. I mean, stop me if I'm going up the wrong nostril..
Sure.
Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my " Nervous Tick "...
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
One hundred fucking per cent!.. And you know why? Coz I never told her good bye. O. K.? Is that good enough for the " committee? "
How the hell do I know who? Some jerk off. Some peeping tom prick.
Everything you say sounds reason able. But there's also a reason able explanation for the opposite.
What about Citrine?
That's just what I wanna find out.
Now?
It's twenty of three.
What d'you mean, " bits. "
That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living..
What is all this Jennifer stuff?
Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
Then where's the body?.. Where's the body, and why's he hidden it?
Have you got a match on the bullet?
Have you got a print from the hand?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg ally disposed of hospital debris..
She's not " missing. " Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? No. She left of her own free will.. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
I have heard you. You just don't like hearing me. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, in this country, would put a task force together for a body part..
We have a body part in suspicious circumstances a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere and a bill for seventeen dollars for its wig!
Don't underestimate me.. the Mayor's pissed but that's nothing to do with this sit down How many times have you been up at that institute?
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
He says, you freaked one of em out? " Asking a newly blind kid if he can'see,'is both cruel, and dangerous "..
No.
Coz I'm short of men  Ang elo won't do it.. Who ever I got free first you get..
I am calm.. I am calm..
Your predecessor. He did n't like to get outta bed. Catch you later, Freddy T..
Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Vehicle references.
I may have said some thing. I don't recall.
Alright, I gave him the case?.. So the case is closed, so what?
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He reads the newspapers. Col lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down  tried..
Just walk away from me, Taylor..
You haven't. And you got no voice in here, Taylor, so keep it shut.
Then what are you hoping I'm gon na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb er is, or who it was took her there.
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left,  was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
Well, I think I told you on the phone.. I went up to her room to say good bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things..
No.
Me?
Lotta scratch marks on your door?
What color was it?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
Well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin, and this kind of car sounded " hollow "..
No.
Oh.
I'm sorry.. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant.. I feel like everyone's looking at me..
You just asked me to ask you questions.
" Thoughts that lie too deep for tears. "
No, Wordsworth.. Do you like poetry?
Pray?
No, I don't pray.. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well.. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me.. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers? He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.
I was married to her sister..
Ross told me.
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
Just your age.
Fifty seven.. I don't mind..
You know? How do you know?
Who? Probably Angelo.. I'll take care of it.. Don't worry, we're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O. K... O. K.?
You're looking more worried now than when you " decided to stop worrying "?
Why?
No.. not now..
Then explain it to me. I got enough darkness, don't I?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
He don't know that. I didn't.
You do?
It's not as bad as it sounds.. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance  find the best damned lawyer there is..
Why?
Who sought the warrant?
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about..
Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you'll be the first to hear about it..
Yeah, I guess I do.
And you got no idea with who?
What was she like?
What does that mean?
Freddy's new obsession..
Got a handshake like a partially excited penis.
He tells her, " bye bye, " and she gets " attacked. " Well, give me a fucking break! There is no " Ser ial Killer. " Stick her name up in neon, there's still no Serial kil ler! And I ain't the only one say ing it. Everyone in this building is saying it. And I mean everyone.
He was waiting for you, Sir. Wait ed a good while. Said he'd go down and take a look. I hope that's O. K.
No, Sir.
I think I've found a hand.
Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!
" Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Seventy two clients. ONE stayed. Jacket on, tie in pocket.  44.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail. You are Jerry Ma fuckin guire.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
You are not a loser.
Well, no you didn't
It's a plan  51.
Oh honey. It's spun.
I have to finish my job
It's not " love me. " It's not " trust my handshake. " It's make the sale. Get it signed. There shouldn't be " confusion " about that.
I think you added the " brutal. "
It's over
You've never been alone and you can't be alone
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
Still going.
Wait. What do you mean?
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last minute scenario. It's big.
Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
I know who y6u are. You're Dorothy Boyd. You're in... wait... you're in Accounts. You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Now what did you lose?
And have fun at your bachelor party.
Nnnnn. I just killed the surprise.
Oh tsht. Yes.
The part about " we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm "
No no, I know
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
It's all going to work.
Happy for us.
Call me later, hon.
I'm glad you're home. That " alone " thing is... not my specialty...
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
Sure
Especially one like this.
Don't worry about it, boss.
Yeah, I did.
No. No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
I may not sue.
Actually he said " glad. "  85.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk but we have a company here to think about. I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Yeah, I did am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were...
Let's not tell our sad stories.
No. I have to go in. I live here.
Okay. Wait here a second. Do we really want to do this?
And I appreciate that impulse.
So I'll see you this weekend.
Will you marry me?
Okay... I will...
It's not fair to you. This whole
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid. I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us. I did this. And at least I can do something about it now.
I don't need you to " stick. "
I don't know
I think we made a mistake here.
I don't like to give up.
What about Ray?
Come on, Jerry. You know this isn't easy for me.  118.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost
Honey, he's engaged. And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest. Wait. Use the frosted glasses.
Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up  74.
As opposed to twenty angry women?
Thanks.
Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
I... I love everybody, man. I love my wife. My kids. Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee. My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too. That about says it...
You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
You know I don't do " contracts. " But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
I'm sorry, I
Exactly. And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look! And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water. Say hello to Jerry Maguire
It's a very personal, very important thing. It's a family motto. So I want to share it with you. You ready?
Here it is. " Show me the money. " Show. Me. The. Money.  36.
Let's do it again.
Okay, I understand. I'll boil it down for ya. Fuck Nike. All they do is ignore me...
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake? I'm a very good singer, man
I might call you later!
What are you doing with me, Rod?
Don't you even see I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale!
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic
It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime.  69.
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
John Taylor. J. J. Stokes. Andre Rison. I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
Maybe you don't. Because it's not just the money I deserve. It's not just the " coin. " It's the...
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package. The kwan.
No, I air dry.
No tell me.  84.
It's a risk.
What do you know about dating a single mother?
You know when you know. It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
Then you gotta have The Talk.
Well, that ain't fair to her. A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man.  103.
I didn't " shoplift the pooty. " We were thrown together and I mean it's two mutual people who Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
Well, this was another way to go.
I'm worried too. I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.
Don't I know. Now go home to your wife.
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
You don't want to go home, do you?
I'm asking you a question
I'm trying to talk to you. How's your marriage?
You're jabbing at me.  112.
That's an answer.
For loyalty, you buy a dog. For love, you get married.
Why not
I think so.
Beautiful.
Only'cause my wife likes your wife!
Where'd you find the perfect white shirt?
Bobbi Fallon. BPI. I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right? Because I finally see the white picket fence looming and I love it / hate it / love it / hate it / love it... you're right, I'll know when I see him. Why is it so easy to talk with you?! Tell me about your fiancee.
She's an NFL publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why I should take a nap now...
Gorgeous.
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
To the pools?
Oh no  14.
But wait...
Damn right.
My husband believes in you. We're gonna make it. Bye bye Dorothy.
Keep the phone open. I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
Alright, I'm freaking too. But they need you to stay calm. I'll call back.  124.
Pleasure.
I'm fine. What's up?
You wanted smaller.
Jerry
You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always. We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters
They do, my brother.
Let's go the zoo.
You said " fuck ".
Funny... I better go to bed.
It's in a cage. Do not be scared of...
What'd I say?
I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth.
A bird cage.
He says it's a bad idea!
We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U. S Embassy our U. S. Embassy said we should " accept the inevitable. " You believe that?
You hate to swim.
No, Dr. Grant says...
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
Fine... and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
What?
What did you say?
What did you say!
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe. I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
I don't remember
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
He could have died.
I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that  s where he's headed.
Then we should...
Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
About a thousand feet above it, actually. Most mountain climbers remember how tall that mountains were.
Dr. Grant was.
Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
Not if it can't dig.
What?
That does sound lucky.
Reverse Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
They never got that big.
Not with that sail. Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
Billy, I can't talk to you now.
I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
My favorite.
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
To a degree we never imagined.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
On the island.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
What did you think?
Mine's new.
We need to head for the coast.
Why?
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer or the paleontologist get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
You're right.
Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you? They look worried.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
I'm flattered, but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego, you can  t fly low enough to see anything of interest.
Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive.
Stan.
You. Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
How do you mean?
Ajay. Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.
" Minimal " is too much. It has to be light, it has to be strong
You are an academic.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
They do have motives. Why did you want to see me? Your message said it was urgent.
What are you talking about?
I don't believe you.
No, no, no, no, no, no...
Are you out of your mind? I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot you think I need more of that?
So what?
You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials. I believe you already know Sarah Harding. She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter / scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this. If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup. When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.
Why wouldn't they? Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds
We've got to see one to find out. Is there any
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right. You're going to have a fantastic time.
I can't tell you. But I'll be back within a week.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
Very hurtful. Your mother tell you to say that?
You know, at the bus stop. With the hair?
Well, is he?
That Richard.
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you. I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?
On the side of that one truck.
I'm fine... I'm fine...
Good lad.
How close do you have to be?
Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
Killing lessons? Heartwarming.
You're kidding yourself. An adult T rex cares about one thing filling its own belly. It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it. If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety nine percent would
We've got to transport it seven thousand miles. Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member?
You signed a non disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw. You violated that agreement.
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to
You version of it.
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests. People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.
I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T rex in one theme park could single handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11.
I don't know these guys, but I know'em. I've seen'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic. They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
What are they?
She's with Sarah!
This is single wall construction! It's just a shack!
For sixty seconds, maybe! Look at this! You could
I think she's with Sarah!
We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
A statistical phenomenon. Says everything in the world goes in streaks. It's real, you see it everywhere in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets. Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad. Bad things cluster. They go to hell together.
So that others would know about this place?
Because it exists.
Yes. And people will live in the absence of truth.
I don't care about my life. But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead. And they asked him, " why did you go up there to die? " And he said " I didn't. I went up there to live. "
Don't let it out of your hands again. Can the kid walk?
I'm her father.
John Hammond.
Think fast, Sarah.
I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes! There we are your baby is free
Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back. I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now. This expedition is over.
They're pushing us over the cliff.
Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals. The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T rex in the middle of times Square.
These formations. They're dried
That must be interesting. What drew you there?
Very noble of you. You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
Oh, please. How am I supposed to keep a straight face when Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
It's not worth taking the chance, John.
It could have been worse, John. It could have been a lot worse.
Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off line, didn't he?
Fences are failing, all over the park! A few minor systems, he said!
The monitors are failing.
Shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start up modes correct?
What one?
Two million great. That would help. Oh good, that'll take no time.
No trick to it. Just stop running the program. Leaving them unattended.
How am I supposed to transport them?
That's up to your guy on the boat. Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
I got an eighteen minute window. Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
They are? I'll be damned.
Pretty sure.
You won't be able to miss them. Can't miss them.
Could I have a tissue please?
Give time, they'll out draw the T rex. Guarantee it.
You're absolutely right. Yes, you're right. Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious. We're over dependent on automation, I can see that now. But that's all correctable for the next time around.
Well, because you're a I'm a
Okay, I'm following the tubing. I'm going down a passage way. How long does this stuff go for? Could you guys talk a little bit to me?
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing. What's so wrong with kids?
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Oh my god, they do not! They don't smell.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
The what?
Anything else, you old fossil?
It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
Sattler.
How did you do it?! How did you do this?!
Yeah, I know.
Totally incidental unrelated to the feeding pattern
A gizzard
What happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them
And swallows fresh ones.
Ellie, get the gun! Try to reach the gun!
That's right. But they never attack the same place twice. They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically. They remembered.
Because we're being hunted. From the bushes straight ahead.
I know, it's very exciting.
And scary.
It's anti nature.
It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems. It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine.
Alan, listen to this.
Oh, imperfections?
Unpredictability....
Alan?
Faster! Shit, shit, shit, faster!
Yes. It's not a criticism, by the way.
You're telling me that we're facing a  20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
I understand that. I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal with this situation now. The insurance company
Why not?
Dilophosaurus.
People were gettin'bloody noses things on your head aneurisms
Are they heavy?
Then they're expensive. Put them back.
Let's get something straight, John. This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island. Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned. Forty eight hours from now, if they aren't convinced. I'm not convinced. And I can shut you down John.
Sure, they will, they will. We'll have a coupon day or something.
I've never been a rich man. I hear it's nice. Is it nice?
Brakes? No. No brakes. They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non polluting, top of the line!
Tim.
Whichever one you are.
I'm stuck. The seat's got my feet!
It's just like coming out of a tree house. Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
Me too. Okay. Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
So am I going to help you with your foot?
You'll probably be safe enough on your own
Maybe it's hard to say.
A Do you think he saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
A Do you think he saurus Rex.
This is a seventy seven ton animal. Come on over, Lex! Just think of it as a big cow. Look at it's teeth? Come here, girl. This is a seventy seven ton animal. Just think of it as a big cow!
Amphibian DNA.
Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence. Tim! Get down right now. Get off the fence! Now!
To Ellie  You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?
Why? Oh, I'm sorry. Are you two, uh are? I wish you the best luck.
I must've touched something. This happens all the time. It must be my fault. Machines hate me.
Yeah, they hate me.
No.
Well, I didn't ask. Why wouldn't they be?
What's to be scared about? It's just a little hiccup in the power.
I didn't say you were scared.
Fine.
Relatively.
What? What can we do?
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
Well, I'm afraid I do. There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe. He represents my investors. He says they insist on outside opinions.
Not to put a fine point on it, your kind. Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds. If I could just get you two to sign off on the park you know, give a wee testimonial I could get back on schedule schedule.
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
For a further three years.
Let's get outta here!
He left us! He left us!
It's safe.
Alright.
They're just doing what they do. Well the other kind just do what they do.
All night?
Bet you'll never look at birds the same way again!
Timmy! Do as he says! Timmy! Do as Dr. Grant says, quick!
It's am easy catch, you let go you do the counting, you count it, Tim. One, two, three you do all the counting, okay?
I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you! Lex, I've got to get him!
I certainly have! Very clearly! Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
Don't do that!
But this is nature! Why not give an extinct species a second chance?! I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this! have anything to say at all!
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist. How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
You're right, John. You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
I don't think there's been any debate. There's no debate... my mistakes....
Thanks, Dad.
Ray, start the tour program.
Thanks, Steve.
We love the presents.
I don't know! I'm sorry!
Yeah, you weren't in that last one.
That means they only eat vegetables. But for you, I think they'd make an exception.
Hey Lex, you forgot to say gazundheit.
No, but...
That's not true...
I don't think you're getting in the spirit of things, Janet. We'll buy whatever studies we need
Get rid of them.
I think we're lost.
I know... but we left the main trail... and I can't find any landmarks around here... I've been trying to figure it out but...
Help me with this.
I want to look at the rest of the house.
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder one charges.
His camera... it's still recording.
Who?
What are the charges?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...
Did you find a scalpel? Did you find a murder weapon?
Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of  these .
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
Doesnit sleep?
He wets the bed?
This is Jason Voorhees. They'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair. If we're going to argue insanity, we're going to need something a little more concrete.
No need. I'm self diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy... And I'm a bed wetter.
I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
Well, Jason  was  in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake... People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.
That didn't sound very convincing.
Oh?
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three  months . A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one oh two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep. They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having  insomnolesence .
It's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus. The part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive. They didn't know about it back in the sixties. Even now, it's not understood very well.
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
How do we prove it?
Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.
Cute waitresses?
I'll take my chances. Come on, I'm buying.
Well, I'm onto something more useful. You ever hear of a man named Fred Krueger?
Fascinating.
Uh huh...
Yeah... I think I understand... You're drunk, too.
 It's a second REM pattern .
Add it to the list.
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
You're not going to be there?
Jason's asleep... maybe he's dreaming of himself as a young boy... and that boy is sitting right here. I think he's some kind of projection from Jason's subconscious.
Great. Now there's  two  serial killers on the loose.
Think it'll do any good?
Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
How long will the effect last?
Ten minutes...
A glorified office block. They keep all the old records there the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
Just what you've published.
I read the one about the penal colony.
The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man. Very good.
Where do you get your ideas? Only joking I'm just joking. Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
Why do you work in that hideous insurance office? dealing with people who fall off ladders. Now take me I make my living as a stone mason. It's not my art but it's the tools of my art. You could be a journalist.
No not even success. My writing is not for making a living it's for living. Not for other people, it's for me.
The Castle cemetery.
I'm trying to find things out myself that's the whole point.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else wasn't it part of the Castle originally? I always assumed there'd be a gate or something. Isn't there?
A cenotaph a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look
Will you do me a favor then?
If I don't see you later go to my house and find my notebooks and destroy them. All my manuscripts just burn them. Please.
It's my last and final one.
A true friend would do it.
You didn't give it to me.
Did you see him?
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out. He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
Who's to say he ever will? He's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone's toes In fact, I'm the only one he trusts and he wouldn't even look at a document if it didn't first come through me.
But I'm the messenger. An error like this damages my credibility.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
Oh, don't they? I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
It's what I'm paid to do.
And you're late!
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
Oh well, I thought he once mentioned
Have you looked?
He would have. You were his best friend. A better friend than me.
What?
It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.
As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator with no recourse whatsoever.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
He wasn't robbed. He was identified by his wallet.
When I have no reason to doubt.
What could he have done to warrant that?
There are some people I'd like you to meet. Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
Eduard wanted to marry me.
I'm suspicious of men who want to marry. I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.
You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice a high concern for the lot of your fellow men. And yet you're able to remain an outsider. With the concomitant air of... superiority?
He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
Yes which is why " quiet, dependable people " have to take charge of their own lives.
Burgel! I didn't leave it with him.
They're not obliged to tell.
Of course it could Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember. He could've killed Eduard.
I wouldn't put it past him.
It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
He's jealous, yes, but that jealous? He's too cautious.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
I've just come from the Castle. It's over.
This is the result of their elixir of youth. They were to come and check on it during the night. I contrived to miss the appointment.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon with all the others.
I know there is. And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
Why should I believe a man who never believed me? They're absolutely right, you know guilt should never be doubted. It's easier that way.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to. When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
I do. Always. You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka. And what it's becoming. I've always held you in the highest regard.
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Did you go anywhere afterwards to have a drink perhaps?
Your office is the Workmen's
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of... pills and so forth.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
He was found in the River. Could he swim?
Was he depressed?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
We know that.
... Just a perception.
I'll bear that in mind.
If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?
She's missing. I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.
That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.
You should meet my father.
It's a farce.
You see, Kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at Orlac which is what this paper referred to the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement. Our latest preparation we believe we pray is perfected. It should take years off her.
I'm not obliged to give you access, you know not without authorization but I'll make an exception this one time.
It's gone out so quickly?
You mean my Chief has it.
It's a factory in the northern mountains. One of our best customers. Without a proper request I'm not obliged to do this, you understand but I'll make an exception on this one occasion.
I did read that. They gave him a posthumous medal.
This is the cross reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
I could always apply there.
Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you. Do you know her?
It's not too bad working here.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
What's to become of us now?
Amerika!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
Miss Darrow... I've been thinking. I would very much like to dedicate this motion picture to the memory of your father. It's a great shame he wasn't able to join us on this adventure. Truly a wonderful man.
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two bit hustler on the make!
Tell me, Mr Driscoll is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down?
Do they have him on display at the weekends?
I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island... nothing's going to stop me!
When this boat finally reaches Jakata, I'll be first off. You'll never see me again... and believe me that day cannot come soon enough. I've got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage.
I can't imagine you crying.
But... we can't Jack, I need time to collect artifacts... make sketches... gather evidential information.
This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game two men have already died!
No! Don't!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
You're the animals all of you!
I tell you it doesn't exist!
Two... maybe three.
Oh my God... Ann?
What was it, Jack?
You better not slow us down, Denham!
Kong...
The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.
Why?
What's that?
What's compassion, mister.
Can't you see I'm strung out? Please, we're waiting for it he's got to have it!
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Did he come around often?
Uh uh.
Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.
Well she's not now. I did everything for Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First. But she wouldn't stay off it the junk and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We could've had everything together, everything and then the bitch sold my mink!
Sure dear, yes.
Yes?
Mm.
And nobody could tell me who he was an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or but I felt it stirring inside me, this this wild, pagan feeling
Guess!
I do not love him.
Do you always have to repeat?
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me you know? I'm all screwed up.
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money. All right, not the money. A kind of put on. It gets things back together. Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle calls, a tryout. I mean before before I got this job and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
I said that. Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely you know, the hate or So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it. And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is. And it's not real and you don't have to even like them you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe you know?
Well I have to close up now.
Yes indeed.
Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
A few more days. We know who did this.
No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The man that killed him also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
Why isn't he locked up?
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
What was better? I made better bait?
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? don't worry, don't
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have
Grunemann? I've looked at him a
We can talk
All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you? Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book.
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
Tom Grunemann discovered me we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
Oh no, I don't think
You said that.
Gee.
Why?
Honest?
Dew yew hayuv ah dentifikyshun?
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull dykes.
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he when well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me that'd be about two years ago.
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he
I can't say he was anybody!
What about the other things you've reported? being followed on the
Is that how you met the Dumper? Someone else gave
How else do you meet them? Pimps?
What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?
You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things
Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
Rounds, what are they? don't watch me, keep talking.
Can't you get him?
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper Frank sent me on it.
He never told me.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
Well she's dead.
Is there anything more I could
What're you gonna do next?
What do I do meanwhile? wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
You said it was!
Oh wait oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Goodbye.
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy baby
Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there? You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time but never with a John.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
You could help me find her. You know the people. I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
Don't worry.
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann
But if it's someone else I do.
The same as Jane McKenna.
Just let me know when you are going out and where
How can you do it to yourself?
Ligourin: How could you do it?
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me. You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
No, you can find some other way. Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to
No. Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
No, not just'mm'. You don't know what I
Is that all you have to say?
Well, I told him I wouldn't uh go there any more. I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.
You and I a relationship.
Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life.
Bree
Go down in my room.
Oh zippidy doo, they'll find my fingerprints. Can I go in? I need some stuff.
I called Trina.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Mm.
Mm.
You wanted to, or you are?
You could at least look at me!
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
What?
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
Then, close the case.
Where, how?
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
I think you're homesick. I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful. John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.
I read your report. I had to go along with it the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well any new developments?
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he
Some mistake perhaps that
You must be discouraged.
That who?
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
What?
You were hired to look for Tom.
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
No, I'd like to be in on it.
I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
OK and one of them Jane McKenna she blows a little jealous of Bree you know? Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak that he was a dumper she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
You don't tell them. That one of their own in laws laid a dumper on them? Peace in the family. Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
Not unusual.
About his letters that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
No. She had every good intention of it coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life. But they don't really know much about life: They get confused or scared or frustrated or bored they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction.
Town Police.
I know Tom Grunemann.
We grew up together. Kids.
No.
No.
Everybody's got some, I guess.
No.
What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
I don't believe Tom's alive.
If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think all he really had to do was write us a letter.
Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and
I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
Good. I'll see him in there.
Does that distress you?
What does?
Very well, I'd like to see him if I may.
That's Kim... and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
Oh, sure. Here, this can be mommy.
What do you like best about your daddy?
Tell me, does your daddy ever hit you?
My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me?
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
Show.
Oh, Christ... Ah, yeah... you want to know why mom's not here, right?
Sure. Didn't I ever tell you French toast was my specialty? I'll bet I never told you that. Now then, the first thing we need is...... eggs! Right?
Will she pick me up after school?
What if she forgets?
Goodbye.
Sorry.
Yeah?
That's not the right soap. We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
We use the green and yellow.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's just... I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
You don't hate it. We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
All it is is onions and gravy.
You are not allergic of onions.
Then eat around it.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Not on your life. That's it. I've had it with crap around this house. From now on, no more pizza! Get it? Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
I want my mommy... I want my mommy..
I'm sorry...
Are you... gonna go... away?
Sleep tight.
See you in the morning light.
Right.
Is that really your chair?
Wow! That's neat. Can I sit in it?
Are you going to get remarried?
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
What did you do when you were little?
Did you watch " I Dream of Jeannie? "
Was there Burger King?
What else wasn't there?
Because... Well, that's what he does. He's a very powerful man.
Bigger than a principal. The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...... he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment. And I'm very lucky. Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
What don't you understand, pal?
At your mom's. She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Your mom.
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay? Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
I see. Well, you'll have to do better than that. Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
No, counselor, I'm going to over rule you on this line of questioning.
And would you describe those years as happy?
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex husband?
Did you wish to?
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
And what is your present salary?
And yet you chose to leave him?
Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
And did you have a close personal relationship?
And how did you find his work?
And yet you fired him.
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
A heavy drinker?
Was he unfaithful?
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
Well, I can certainly understand why you left him.
I don't recall.
Then, we don't really know, do we, when you say " permanently " if you're planning to remain in New York, or even to keep the child for that matter, since you've never really done anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be regarded as permanent.
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
How long was that?
So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life.
I consider it less my failure than his.
That represents a gross billing in excess of two million What?!
I took two thousand out of the savings account. That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning. They'll be ready on Saturday.
I've paid the rent, the Con Ed and the phone bill, so you don't have to worry about them.
You just don't get it, do you? I am really and truly leaving you.
No you didn't. You didn't even ask about Billy.
I'm not taking him with me.
Ted, I can't... I tried... I really tried but... I just can't hack it anymore...
I am not! I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother. I yell at him all the time. I have no patience. No... No. He's better off without me. Ted, I've got to go... I've got to go.
NO!... Please... Please don't make me stay... I swear... If you do, sooner or later... maybe tomorrow, maybe next week... maybe a year from now... I'll go right out the window.
A few times. Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.
Watching my son... Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
Ted... The reason I wanted to see you... I want Billy back.
I want my son. I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Ted, listen to me... You and I, we had a really crappy marriage Look, don't get so defensive, okay? It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty two year old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child. I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get. Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink. Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Joanna, go fuck yourself!
Please, Ted. I never would have brought it up if I thought
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the
Please... Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do..
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two... He's yours... I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Only can I still see him?
Listen, Ted... I just want to tell you, when old man Schmidt retires next year, I've got a pretty
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay? Three marriages, two divorces... You're gonna be okay.
She'll be back...
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay? But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while. Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us that's you and me to deliver the goods. Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose
I don't. Jim, this isn't anything like what we talked about. It's not even close.
Jim, this is garbage. This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about. None of it. You can't
Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
Do you?
You dope. O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy. All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
No. No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen. He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
I don't want to hear another word against him. Not another word. He's a wonderful man... a wonderful man...
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969 in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
Yeah?
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Good. You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer. How old is the child?
I lost him? I lost him?
Oh, no..
What if I fight it?
I'll take my chances.
Don't worry. I'll get the money.
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
How many?
Mr. Kramer, there's
I came home tonight. We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency. Do you know what that means?! Do you understand what that means? It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
I walk in the house and before I can say " How are you? ", " Did you have a nice day? " before I can say anything. Pow she's out the door.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Things? What kind of things?
Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life. She's got a husband that loves her. She's got a terrific kid. She's got a wonderful home
Did it ever occur to you guys that Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person in the world to live with?! Did it?! For one thing she's always thirty minutes late. You can set your watch by it
Joanna said that?
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know? I'd like to know one thing, okay just one little thing. Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
I'd like to know what the hell kind of courage it takes to walk out on your husband and your child?
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
All right... Okay... But let's get something straight, right now. I mean, I'm sorry about what happened between you and Joanna, but it's not my problem, understand?
You're on your own, understand?
You're sure?
Slow down... Slow down...
How many onions does it say to use?
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
C'mon, Thel. So Charley had a little fling. So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
California?
What d'you tell her?
I don't mean a little favor. mean a big F favor.
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should
Thel, listen to me. If, on the million to one shot that I should That anything should happen to me. Would you take care of Billy?
I thought about it a lot and you're the only person I know that I trust with him. I mean, if anything happened to me, he'd be okay with you. You're a good mother.
Ah, Charley and I are... Well, we're thinking about... I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
Please, Thel...
Tell me.
Cow.
Me. First break of day.
I pooped.
I miss him too.
Two.
Please, come in, so cold.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
You're all fuckers. Vicious little fuckers.
Oh well, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.
The reason I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.
Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat.
And law enforcement, such dangerous work. The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
Why are we landing?
So why are we landing? Hector.
Jesus. About twelve more yards. Keep coming just like that.
Wait just a second. You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
C'mon, we're losing light, why does the big one heckle me?
And what would he do come winter?
Keystone what?
No!! What's with digging the holes?
Everybody out, back to your tents, now!
I do not like you.
What are you doing?!
I'm laying a spring trap!
I keep telling you, they can come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night
This could end up saving your life,
That " Walt " guy got hit underwater
Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
Bite my bishop.
Sobek. Half man, half croc, oldest God
That sounds good but underneath it's hurtful. Nightcap?
You probably do want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
I see blood. Maybe you got him, Hank.
He never said " go ".
Hey!!
Forget it.
The more he thrashes, the better.
We're ready.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Okay. Lead him in. Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide. Everybody up on the trucks.
You shoot on my order. If he charges, I'll be yelling " go " which means drivers take off. And drive fast, they can move on land. You set?
She didn't tell us about the other croc'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
Just those two.
Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.
Hector.
I'm just saying last resort.
As if. Will you miss me?
Scales were oval. It was an Asian crocodile.
Hector. What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
Excuse me?
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack
Eh. Fuck it.
Yes. You may. But maybe... I don't know...
They won't. He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
Yeah, you got bit. I'm gonna fix it.
And Hank. I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene. I never believed it.
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to
And even if they did, I doubt he or she would have problems with tents.
You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
If this is who I think it is. It is.
Hector Cyr. He's a rich kook mythology professor. He's done some work with our museum. He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.

Good luck.
No. U. S. Wildlife is on their way.
Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster. They just want us to sit tight.
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's... in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake and a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
I didn't say it like that.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
Just forget it.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Let's get away from the shore.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
No thanks.
Thank you.
We could not say it and... Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to...
What?
I'm not mushing it.
I'm not mushing it.
Really
Calm down.
Calm down.
No! You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin'with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and
We might as well pack.
We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
He looks like a giant tea bag.
Hector.
No.
You think?
Probably not.
I'll call the coroner.
Are they feeding?
They look like they're jumping.
They won't be here till at least noon. We got a few hours to kill.
Hector. Do not move.
He just kinda gurgled. He was pretty much dead.
The lake was dead calm until up he came. The tooth is in there.
Yes.
That's where they keep them. You want me to bring the tooth out here?
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
This is a little different.
And this is how he came to the boat?
Okay. And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?
Not yet.
We?
You have a thing against museums?
Ever even been in one?
And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?
Sheriff.
Gee.
I told you. Two days, we'd have to camp.
What the hell?
It looks like a branch.
I just let go of it.
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
What? I don't even know the guy.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
What is this?
Well. He's probably rugged handsome I guess. Yeah.
Look ten feet into the water.
That it's about to go wrong.
Kevin, as long as we... What was that last part?
Yeah, that part. There's... somebody who's um...
Oh... No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm... I actually have an early lunch, so...
Yes, well... famished.
This is business. There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake. Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear. They say it looks prehistoric. Like maybe a dinosaur.
I want you to go there.
This is what we do?
Are you on drugs?
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty third Street
I'm not even a field person.
I never do field work and even if I did, Maine, to look at a tooth of a dinosaur who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something
I am not going to Maine. That's ridiculous.
Well you shouldn't have. How did you even know where I was.
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
Really? I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
You?
You and Kevin.
I'm not upset, Myra, okay. I just never thought of you as a y'know...
No.
Myra.
I really... I should get back.
I love it when you talk dirty.
Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person not just an object.
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
Lecter said a lot of things.
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
What girl?
But why? He didn't weight the others.
He knew her...!
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin'you about it now,'cause he may never.
Listen, I hope you never need a thing I've taught you. But you've got something... Jack sees it, I do too. If you ever need to, you can shoot.
You're all right! Where is he?
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up. Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but
Shut UP! The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now!
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his " taste " so to speak.
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... On the afternoon of July 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary. His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an EKG. When the nurse bent over him, he did this to her...
But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
He's my patient! I have rights! I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice.
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes.
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
Good idea.
Oh.
Not yet! just wait for me. Maybe in about two seconds.
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job, more of an interesting errand. Walk me to my car, Starling.
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
The psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
He mentioned a name, at the very end. " Mofet... " Any followup on her?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Miggs has been murdered.
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless. Starling...?
You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello... I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on.
Good idea, but he thought of it, too. We've run simulations, using different vectors and the best dates we can assign. You put it all in the computer, and smoke comes out. No, this one is different. This one has seen us coming...
Why?
Why not?
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
Are you finished?
Point taken.
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but
You seem pretty sure of that.
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
What would it take?
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it eventually but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.
If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
You do until six p. m.
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
That's why they're all so big because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile to loosen their skin, so that
Where?
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was " John Grant. " Calumet Power  Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
No, Starling, there isn't time. And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio. We want him for murder, not kidnapping. I'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl, before he's indicted.
Yes sir. Thank you, sir...
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
Dr. Lecter...
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
She died. She went to Florida to retire, like two years ago? She dies own there.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job. This toaster giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day she thought this was really hot shit. What did she know, big dummy...
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph. D.
Yes, miss.
Absolutely.
I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference.
You knew them.
Your " father "?
He did?
What?!
Thank you so much.
I do not remember them. I was one or two.
My father sent Uncas  I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' arithmetic from yours.
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
' Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin'by another's leave... Their name was Cameron. John  Alexandria.
On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring... to my blood...... than any imagining could possibly have been...
What would you have me do?
Do not. Promise me.
Our father? Did you see my father?
My letter...
What?
I sent three men to Webb!
You do not know what you are saying!
You still have an aversion to the water?
Some say that's the way of it.
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
... Fort William Henry.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
What?!
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
Of course not! And how is it you were nearby?
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Fort Edward, then?
I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
England does not protect me and does not war against France on our account. She uses us to war against France on her own account... of greed for land and furs.
Excuse me...
That is the truth!
Major! Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.
I don't understand!
Then what?
And if we're unlucky?
Folks here goin'to join in that fight?
It does and it is a better lookin'reason than you, Jack Winthrop. Push hard,'cos you got to clear the French outpost by dawn. Good luck, Jack.
Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron.
Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man? Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do? Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads  brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold?... Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt  work the land? Or of dogs?... Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs?... Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't know. I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people... Let the children of the dead Munro go free... I speak the truth.
You forget yourself!
The Crown " negotiating " the terms of service?
I thought British policy is'Make the World... England', sir.
Yes. You may. You there. What does Munro call you? The " Scotsman " has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you.
Thank you. How can I reward you?
Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them. They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range, so when they're close enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. They look to be three hundred yards out. Bloody murderers. You have three days.
Yes, sir.
Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not.
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
Excuse me. What did you say?
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
The King? The King has mountains of gold!
I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you.
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
Does the rule of English law no longer govern? Has it been replaced by absolutism?
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood. It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill. It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need. And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
My son Magua's pain is my pain.
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake. Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south. And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves. Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
Their arms?
My colors?
Allow me to consult with my officers.
Le mot d'ordre?
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
We almost had an accident today. DeJesus'suit...
What mistakes? Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check.
Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
For this... you don't need to be.
And?
Why Sixpack?
Yeah... right...
Was there such a thing?
Not exactly a big ocean country.
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life? Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
Stay calm!
... all of you owe time and I thought tonight would be a good time to
One of those chunks of Sixpack! Like a big leech, with those teeth!...
No way...
I am thinking, man! You think I want to die! I am thinking! I
That's an order!
Williams... get DeJesus'suit on the " sick rack " and do a diagnostics. Any other suit problems she should know about?
Huh? I... uh... uh...
Today... with DeJesus. That was smart thinking to get him inside...
Still... you did the right thing.
No. I'm just being friendly.
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line. Sup posed to hone leadership skills or something.
Maybe they already have.
Less than an hour. It's ruptured an air duct.
He's not at his station.
What's wrong with it?
All right...
No sir... I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
No... she killed herself.
Well, suit yourself, then... its your decision... Ha ha... a little joke... suit yourself...
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
Beck, trust me. If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
Unfortunately. We can't.
But it's a delay! How long? A day? Two days?!
How's TransOcean doing?
What about his suit? That's a million five the company's got to replace. They'll make somebody go get it.
What was it?
Take it off and let me have a look.
That thing happens to be my friend.
I do, man. That's a beautiful place. When I get out of here I'm going there. Find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire
You're on your way somewhere all right... the looney bin.
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
I'm going to try to remove it.
... It has many traits of deep sea marine life... regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy... but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality...
How is he?
Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
Who's the best power forward in the NBA... Jameson?
I'm not touching you!
The latch is screwed up. Or the hinge.
Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six... no, five days?
Well not exactly, no; I got'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
Yeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.
And Tom took care of them.
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang utan in that.
I thought this was a pub.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
You should see what they did to poor Gary.
I don't know what you mean.
Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer lock muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold'em!
I am not fucking interested.
Inside, out fuckin'side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't...
You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back you up with a Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?
Where did he get a hundred grand?
Good, you can get this under control now.
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
I see, one of those  on a need to know'basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
Nope.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
They were going to pay, then?
Good job, Chris.
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
All right, furry muff.
You had better be careful.
Is that you, Dean?
What can I do for you?
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to see them or the guns again.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.
In fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? You could say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking Everest of problems, couldn't you?... And the reason it is such a mon fucking strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first fucking idea who did this to us, do you?
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
But... Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to'em.
What they like then?
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap:  If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me'stuff.
Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots.
And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit'em up, scare and gag'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Plank?
And the weed?
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia...
No, just one of them is in charge of them going to the job. So I assume he will still
And look what happened to that.
There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.
I mean it's fucking empty.
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
Where the hell are we supposed to hide?
This is our money, Tom!... Now I think we should go.
Tom?
Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.
I will loan you the money.
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
It's pay day, ain't it?
I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy... but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!
Yes?
And?
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
And you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
I can't help you, Plank.
Hold on. OK. Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our interest.
Lives and learns doesn't one.
What are you doing, Plank?
And that does include the amp?
Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's on and burning bright for the masses.
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon'Who do you think I am?
They look nice, I agree... but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat Man Fucking Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route.  Never mind that, what about the money?
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.
Well, excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any difference, they are still fucking guns, and they still fire fucking bullets!
What about all the gear?
You would take a pain  n the arse full stop.
How many wings have they got between them?
How many feet?
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy? 
OK, don't panic; let's think about this.
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it... and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort er fucking culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.
And those stupid girls who hang out with them
It's pathetic. You can't be desperately in love when you're 14 years old.
Just'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here
You and all of the teachers in this dump your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun.
You're going to be on your own.
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
That makes it okay?
Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for
That isn't true.
If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled.
And what did she do?
Catholic school, nasty.
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Who's " they "?
And that's the job? Nothing about serving your country?
Please.
Do whatever they tell you
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
Because it's a job?
Chaos.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
You're dismissed, Private.
Will this go on my record?
You're dismissed.
And you and Private Graves
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
I hear they're closing that post down.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
Skinny?
Nice job.
Charley Wade.
It didn't come out of a cereal box.
You know the popular version of how he left town.
You got a cause of death?
So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
A. 45
Just wondering.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story even if it's forty years old.
So?
That's not the point.
I'm not picking it up.
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
Now or later, Charley. You won't have any trouble finding me.
You still going to all the home games?
Bunny, you uhm you on that same medication?
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
You look good
Yeah, well
You were in a fight
Same weight I always was.
Best part of the job.
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
No. You?
You didn't uhm you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage some of it was my father's
Suppose not.
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
" I only got my little girl now, " he says, " she's my lifeline. " Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
Come on in
Come on in.
I never met her.
Uncle Al
I'm a colonel.
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and well, a command is a command.
My mother said he never asked about
Go out through the back.
Both.
They teaching that now? Good. Only a couple of'em held out this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave raiders were on'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass.
Same as they done in Mexico.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
I got a pretty good guess.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
PDA?
Well
Didn't have a father?
When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
So I'm part Indian?
My father says the day you're born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
I have a B average.
Tanks, huh?
So you're going into the Army?
No.
Good.
Yeah. He lives here, right?
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin'back over that bridge on my rubber.
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Something like that.
My government can go fuck itself, and so can yours. I'm talking about people here men. Mi amigo Eladio Cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day
Right.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Cliff
Cliff
You going to get married?
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
Always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice. But marriage, man I did two tours in Southeast Asia and I was married for five years I couldn't tell you which experience was worse.
Mikey
Mikey
Mikey look at this
It's a. 45.
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all. 30 caliber
What's it doing on a rifle range?
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
Seriously.
We been through this before
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post
Man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
Masons been around a long while.
Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
But I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
Take that pair over in the corner
Yeah. I bet he would.
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since
You get much of that in here?
Deal drugs in the bathroom
This is an official visit, then
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit and polish man. Full bird colonel name of Payne, they say Bet you never figured you end up back here.
Right.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
A lot of'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people you're not either on one side or the other
Because I'm your father.
What's in the back?
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
Eladio Cruz.
You carryin'a firearm, son? Don't lie to me now.
Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that.
Is very beautiful, your car.
Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction
Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo  It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid 
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States
You have somebody else out there?
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
No es la verdad  That isn't true 
I thought you were married!
This girl has a child?
Tipico.
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies if you can pay he can handle it.
Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors.
He known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up. " Old Fishbait, " he says, " never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it. "
Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish
And the Sheriff at the time was Big Charley Wade. Charley was one of your old fashioned bribe or bullets kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county.
Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin '
That's a matter of interpretation
Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news
Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel well
Floating around out here, playin'hell with them bass play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer
I haven't been out here for a while.
No.
We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
Bledso
He still living?
Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
And Buddy was one of them.
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
You thought any more about our murder?
Charley Wade.
I got an idea what happened.
I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
Open late.
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy
Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
Widow's benefits. He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin'by after Charley killed her man. They didn't get hooked up till late
Sam
He agreed it wasn't exactly news
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
How'bout the Sheriff?
The old high school heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available
You told me one time it was true love.
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Why would I want to go there?
You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them.
Right. When he was killed.
How come you never got married again?
Nobody's too busy.
Thank you.
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words " some chulo with grease under his nails. "
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos
" That boy " Mami, say his name for chrissakes!
I'm Sheriff Deeds
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
I've seen'em.
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
He had the club out on the old trail road
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
He squeezed money out of you?
And my father?
People didn't complain?
Do you remember the last time you saw him?
No. Is he sick?
I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt
Could of been. That was white people's business.
What about it?
Yeah. How about that? People start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up.
What?
You gonna stay out here?
You got in late last night.
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it
Just'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
How come?
Time marches on.
Three months.
It was for personal consumption.
I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
It could have just been a box lunch from the jail.
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans
Murdered him?
Got him here?
I'll see what's going on.
Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.
Want to take a walk?
I see she built a place up here by the river.
She's done well for herself on her own and all
People liked him.
I remember him watching me once. When I was little before you and I
Weird what you remember.
Nice looking kid.
No
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out
It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.
You don't want to be Sheriff.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
They've got me. Different thing.
Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.
I look at my kids in school tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
I mean what did we know about anything?
Yeah?
How come it feels the same?
So what are we gonna do about this?
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures
Like your story is over.
Yeah?
Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair I don't believe this
From the first time I saw you at school all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history the hell with it, right?
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
Uh huh.
The Republicans?
They got telephones.
Oh.
Yeah.
How'bout you?
I didn't want to be going around your back.
You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
You suckers haven't had a good day since the Alamo.
Otis, apologize to the Sheriff
No, Sheriff, I'm just
And people better clear out of here! Now!
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin'every which way.
We'll get'em So you livin'out here now?
I heard about that deal for your father You must be real proud.
The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin'Much.
But you don't see much competition, do you?
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
Me neither.
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein'it through.
The other one? Hell, at my age, every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one. Your head's all crowded up here it is
How much?
Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
You bet.
I've heard a name. Someone they talk about in whispers.
Nix.
Like in nothing. Nobody. Nix.
I think maybe he taught Swann. This is me. See ya around.
It'll be something hokey.
You ever been married?
Why?
I love weird.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between
That's because he knew. He'd seen these files and knew.
Yes. They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while. I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
I think we make our own futures.
Why not?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
Where do I sign?
Harry.
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience. They love him.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
I can be very persuasive.
Forget the fee. If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money. If I don't...... my gamble. Either way... I get to spend some time... here.
He... didn't have me.. I told you
Just curious. Back to business. Ever heard of a man called Nix? Dorothea?
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
Okay. I'll keep digging.
He was the real thing, right?
Stuff?
He taught all this to Swann?
Too much fame. Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
You said you weren't with him for love.
What then?
He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
I'm here, aren't I?
Nothing you don't want.
Are you sure?
I know. I'm the one who shot him.
Yes.
And Pimm and Swann. Only Nix was ready for them.
Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
... yes?
Out! Out!
You saw this?
I left three messages already.
... they believe you.
Sure.
Oh God.
No. I'm not going near him.
Tapert. So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
What makes you so sure?
New one on me. Okay. Let's see him.
After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones.
Another fucking magician. Jesus.
No. Not yet...
Heaven and Hell?
No. I'm saying they were always fake. The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
If he was so good why's he so dead?
I'd like to hear them.
He was a freak. Everything he did was tainted.
Go away.
What are you, my mother?
Then what do you want?
I'm going back to New York in Shit! I'm outta here.
Nah. You're driving it too carefully.
Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
Philip Swann?
I saw him in Vegas once.
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
What's the difference?
It's not a bad place. Warm. Great view.
Are you sure?
Why'd you come here?
What for?
You didn't hire me. She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
Left alone? Somebody's been murdered.
Fuck regrettable! I want to know why.
I like to know why things happen.
No.
When will she be in?
You want more money, is that it?
You paid off the doctor. You set up the fake body. Yes?
And then... because I was getting too close to something or someone, you called Swann
Was that Swann's idea?
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
Help me.
Don't bother.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
Right. And he's dead, isn't he? I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know. And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
She has no real grip on reality.
Oh yes. We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over. And it's drawn to you. You don't like that.
You can't change it. You have to walk...... walk the line between Heaven and Hell. It's your destiny. Accept it.
The Puritan?
Who is he?
That.
Harry D'Amour.
I'm in from New York. I came to see Swann.
Was he taking a lot of risks?
Not the Walter Wilder?
He knew Swann way back. He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
People are pretty cagey. Who do you know?
For an introduction.
No. There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course. He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
How the fuck do you do that?
I don't think so. You need me alive.
Or murdered, like Nix.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now. That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
Oh yeah?
And she shot him I I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
Help me.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that. So I like playing games with people. Gives them something to wonder about...
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service. It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
He had something. He showed me how to bend the rules. A little levitation. A few fireworks.
No. At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone. Jelly. Shit...
I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick. No illusions. Just the truth. Are you ready for that?
Who else did? Did Valentin?
Jesus!
Nobody's better off this wav!
Fuck.
I can't... I can't go any further...
Can you do it?
Try.
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
Call me tomorrow.
Yeah. But not as cheap. Call me.
One question.
Who is she?
Only I forget. They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
Maybe... I... don't...
I knew Swann. He's a fucking liar.
What is?
Swann?
Yes! Yes!
No. He's coming back. He's digging his way out!
You don't think I've got it to give?
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
The woman has a new love in her life. Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Liar!
Yeah, they told me.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Ok.
Yeah, I'll stay.
How long have you been married?
Try twenty five.
I'm thinking about it.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois, and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
What do you do?
What did you study?
Oh, what do you do with that?
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Thanks.
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Not really. How long are you here for?
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
See you later.
Charlotte, who?
No, its easy.
I don't know.
Really?
I don't remember.
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
Oh. Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
Oh, for her show?
Oh.
I know.
Yeah? But look at you.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
But, I'm mean.
And marriage, does that get easier?
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
Oh.
That's too scary.
No one ever tells you that...
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
In D. C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D. C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
You are.
Four.
You think so?
Do you ever see him?
Do you know where we are?
I'm going to miss you.
Well, I mean it more now.
Why can't it last?
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
That'd be great.
Well... have a good flight.
Ok, bye.
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Can I enter?
Do you like massage?
Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.
Take them.
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music I have to find out what it was...
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
I love you, too, good night, or good morning.
Hi, Lydia.
Uh, no.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I don't know.
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
You know, eat healthier.
Not all that pasta.
Like Japanese food.
Oh, come on.
Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.
Hello?
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
It's ok.
What?
Yeah.
When are you coming home?
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Ok.
Great.
Hospital?
One moment.
Evelyn Waugh was a man.
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
You wanna come?
Ok.
That's ok.
Its bad for you.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
It's ok if you are.
I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.
It's cool... but, I don't know... I went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, I didn't feel anything... I even tried ikebana,... and John's using hair products... I don't know who I .
Ok, bye.
Promoting that action movie I did...
It's amazing there!
No! Hi! So great to meet you!
Weird. The book again. Sex spelled backwards...
Uh... sure... I... what?
You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight. Quarks and dark matter, things like that. Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
I spaced out.
Thank God he did.
Yeah, like...
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
I believe in you.
This is the person... you were talking about?
I found them in your file box.
I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
We're still going to be together.
You're aware that this woman was party to the so called exorcism.
You should know I never felt Mr. Birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care. And then, minutes after they left, he suffered a stroke. He's comatose. No brain wave activity at all.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin. Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified. Maya is eminently qualified.
What did you hear?
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
... the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again...
What do you mean " don't worry? "
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father? That Satan...
Yes... and you are?
Thank you. Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
And also that...
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital " E. "
What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power. Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you. Listen, Ms...?
What's that got to do with you?
I do.
I'll bet.
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
What do you mean?
And this is evil? The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
Well, why should I? Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
What?!?!
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
Trick him.
You should think about getting professional help.
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
My parents are dead. Don't even think of bringing them into this.
But I was baptized. And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
Yes, I know.
So what?
Yes.
Peter, your blood type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive. You father is not who you think he is.
Then why are you here?
I don't know. I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way. I don't know if it works the same way in this instance. I don't even know when it's going to happen.
What?
Comfort.
What do you mean?
You have to say that.
No oxygen to the brain.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend. Get rid of me. I would've...
What about after?
I don't know. Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
Sure.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism. I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
That's his, I don't know, his'grounding'phrase for me, " together, no matter what. "
Maya? What do you mean?
A lot of good that'll do.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya. They're not going to help us.
Alright, Maya. We'll do it your way.
Sure of what? Who cares if this guy is devoid of faith or sleeps over a pentacle? Results are what Lareaux would want.
I'm not waiting until it's too late.
Viznick will get off and Michael's got a crush on you.
Goodbye.
He can see you Thursday.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Nice suit.
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case. You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers. I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by " demonic voices? "
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
What do you mean by that?
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one. Not even God.
And what about you? What about Peter Kelson? Where is your moral compass?
Yeah, right. I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys. I knew you wouldn't show.
Yeah, yeah. I've heard it before. Just be sure you spell my name right. Nine o'clock?
You're too old to smoke. Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
It's another day. I think I'm alright.
Parents died?
What happened?
She told me she killed them.
Had to let her go. I see you thinkin'there, superstar. Don't.
Oh, all that work.
Pants.
I won't. I'm a lesbian.
Watch your mouth.
Child, take a bite.
Don't be defensive. I'm just surprised to see you.
He's still at the bank.
I can manage.
Engaged.
Yeah, you met her?
Maybe she is.
Whatever.
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
There you go.
No I don't.
I wasn't Lena. I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
That's not it.
I do. You never stood up for yourself. Ever. If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
It mattered, Mom.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
You sure?
I just need to lay down. I've been running around all day.
Okay.
Okay?
Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do. Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
Careful.
That was two words.
Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself...
You could make a career by telling me where.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
Why are you up? Get in bed.
Monica. You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you.
I don't wanna see that.
You might be the only one with a job.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
I don't know sometimes.
A horse?
Mom's going to hate it.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
I found you someone.
I know...
No.
This brother from my college.
And he's fine, girl.
I told him you looked like me.
You do.
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you. Trust.
They ever love you back?
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
I was just showing emotion.
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited. Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
I know. But chances are...
I was upstairs for a meeting. I've been hearing good things about you.
So how's the job going?
Thanks, Sidra.
You were trying to make me look bad.
But?
Thanks.
What's that?
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
Yup. So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
It's better. Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad " The American " was making more money. I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball.
What? You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women. They can't get enough of me.
For real?
I never knew a girl that could play.
Your Dad play?
My Dad plays for the " Clippers. " He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too. Same number and everything.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
I don't know. A lot.
You do act different.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
She don't know how to box, I bet. My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.
I don't like flowers.
How bout Twinkies? My mom won't ever buy them.
Okay.
Five seconds.
So?
You're stupid. And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA.
Shut up!
A ride home.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Please.
Big ass titties?
And?
So she's honest.
Didn't know you cared so much.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
Your hot ass temper.
When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
I'm warning you. You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
Didn't know you cared so much.
Good.
You don't look half bad.
You having fun?
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though. So who is this clown?
Guess not.
So what dead end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
You had four offensive rebounds.
You sure?
What'd it say?
Whatever, big head.
I can't be nice to a fan?
I can't help girls coming up to me.
Then prove her wrong.
So you're gonna act salty all night?
Clothes.
What has he been to me? I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing. Like it was easy. And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
He even had me wanting to play for the " Clippers. " Man, how stupid am I.
I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...
I... can't.
Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.
Nah. Don't sweat it.
For real. I should be alone, anyway.
I've been trying to find you all day.
Who's nobody?
You want to go talk?
Nah. I have curfew.
You weren't at my game.
Woman...
We're going to get some food.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
Least she had time for me.
I just said I didn't fuck around. But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
You forgot to be there.
Stay!
Least you got your priorities straight.
Never had to.
Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me? Go fuck Dick Vitale.
How are you going to tell me what I have time for? I mean, whatever I did... we can fix this.
You don't think so?
You're what?
So that's it, just forget about us?
Thanks.
I'm fine. My dad said you tore your ACL.
What are the doctors saying?
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
I forgot, " Q man. "
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Funny. I never did.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All American. And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
Figured it was something like that.
I'm tired of playing overseas. Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
Yeah. Basketball just, isn't fun anymore. You know?
Who's this guy I always see her around?
So... how's the knee?
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
That's okay. I'm probably, you know, busy.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
And you tore up your knee. Rehab is tough.
You're serious.
Like what?
Wow.
So why'd you give up ball?
Cause I don't get it.
What?
From basketball.
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
Wrong.
One game. One on one.
Your heart.
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay. I mean, I was lost. So you are forgiven. But that was five years ago. I moved on.
So?
And what happens when you lose?
Your hair looks so cute like that.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
With who?
You just got back from a four game road trip.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
I have.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
He tore his ACL.
Yeah.
I look like some hoochie to you? I found it on your floor.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught. They see you, they see dollar signs.
You hearing me?
Still the man.
Later when?
I'm fine.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Quincy, please...
Guess I should have been telling your father.
Why not?
That's right.
Didn't we already have this conversation?
You don't wanna hurt your back.
You work too hard, Pop.
Well, tell them to mind their damn business. You're smart enough to get a degree.
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA? Give yourself time to develop, Quincy. Get an education. The NBA ain't going nowhere.
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices. You don't have a choice.
There's this thing out there. This paternity suit.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party. now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy. Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
I just told you.
Why?
What's Mom think?
Still is, so let yourself out.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
Lucky kid.
And some things should never fucking happen!
I ain't a damn liar.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
Always thought " can't " wasn't in a man's vocabulary.
After five years.
Look, I'm busy.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
Good.
And now I'm paying for it, right? That what this is about? " I told you so? "
Yeah.

In pencil led, it's in the form of graphite and in coal, it's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form.

If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs
I'm gonna start rolling
Ok. So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start
I just realized this is for television, isn't it? I can't swear up and down like I just did.
I warned you I get on a roll...
Muffy coffee?
Just to clarify
I would just want to clear some things up:
This isn't meant
Are you asking me that?
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are
It's all important
It's not like I'm trying to attack you
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something something that I understand
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
She does. From when you were a boy.
She lived in Tarzana.
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young
I talked to Miss Simms. Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
Yeah.
You requested my time and I gave it you, you called me a liar and made accusations. And you say, " If I'd known I wouldn't have asked, " then it's not an attack? Well, I don't wanna be the sort of fella who doesn't keep his word. I gave you my time, Bitch. So fuck you now.
The valley?
And what did your parents do?
Why does that sound silly?
Does you mother still work?
Are you close?
What does she say about, " Seduce and Destroy. "
And your father?
I'm sorry.
I wouldn'tve asked
And you ended up at UC Berkely
Psychology major?
Do you have your masters?
In five years?
Where does that name come from?
It's not your given name, right?
And " Frank? "
Ok. That's why. I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change they had no official enrollment
They wouldn't?
Kind of.
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you. We got dissconnected.
Yes. I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry. This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number Do you wanna come in?
These Dogs'll calm down you just have to come in
Ok.
Uh huh. What's going on?
Is he in pain?
... uh huh...
When did he go off chemo?
..... have you ever seen this.. I mean, never mind, you said
Uh. huh.
He's in here?
When they put me on hold, to talk to you... they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes....
It's interesting.
Can you stand... back... maybe, I mean... just a little bit... in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
... just wait... Dad... you want something... can you say...
... you know...
No.
It's just... too late for me to be fuckin'around. I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done
I don't wanna have to lie to anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore.
Yeah. Yes.
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
Will you say my name?
Well can you do me one favor and don't do that.
What happend to you?
I'm sorry.
You want her right now?
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
Fuck. I think I'm gonna throw up, I think. I haven't thrown up since I was twenty years old.
Slowly or quickly?
Come home soon after the show.
Did she talk to you?
Did you tell her?
I love you.
Bye.
It's not really pain.
Do you love me, Rose?
No. No.
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins? Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet.... this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
Yeah.
I don't hate you, Jimmy. But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
Was there anyone that I know?
Who?
Hey.
No.
Just once.
Two years... three years...
It's over. I talked to her this morning.
It's over becuase... for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
What? No, Rose, jesus, no
I don't.
I don't know....
I love you so much.
I think that you know.
I'm asking you. I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you.... please, Jimmy.... tell me.
... No....
But you can't say....
Yes you do.... you do and you won't say.
Yes you do.
No.
You should know better.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back
Saucy saucy.
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this

Why didn't you answer those questions?
Bullshit. Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
I said I'm fine.
Why did you do this?
You're two fuckin'days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this
Hang in there, ok. I love you.
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
.. sorry...
.. sorry...
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten.... by a belt... he hits me with a belt, Stanley.... I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
Cause he hates me.... he hates me so much.
I hate it.
... what...?
No. No. I have to do this on my own.
... fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
.... what the fuck, what the fuck....
What the fuck is goin'on, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
I am preparing for a ball!
He is dead! By God's choice! There is nothing to discuss.
I am King, Mother! And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
Why would you ask now? You never asked before!
You have prayed too much. Your mind is weak.
He is nothing now.
Wear it until you love it. And die in it!!
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
How can I serve you in this?
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel. I will kill both him and the man who told me.
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
Phillippe?! Why do you call me
I see that is a body! But where did you get it?
His plight is obvious, isn't it?
Tonight! Right now! We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
You are not my priest, Aramis! You would not be, even if I had one.
He who is not with us is against us.
Then you are a fool a fool who has never lost a son. What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others? Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
Physical resemblance is but one small thing! Louis has an arrogance, a manner
And people close to him, who
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours! It is Phillippe's as well!
More wine!!
You can do it.
Three days.
The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball. It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one. At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then? Remember France. Remember the poor. Remember Raoul. More wine!! Where are those serving girls...?
Don't play God with me, Aramis I
Going into the barn naked or so it appears.
About to hang himself, I should think.
We must stop him!
But but
All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
But Aramis! Phillippe can learn in time, but
What you're asking is impossible!
But
But
Perhaps. But of d'Artagnan I am certain. What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do be faithful to his King.
Perhaps he serves a different king.
I just said you're praying! Are you deaf too? I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
Really? If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral.
A tomb? We're in a tomb?
It is a weighty problem, Aramis but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
But I was on duty...
The child of the king is... the king. Louis!
Athos, do you understand this? He confuses me
But why?
We go someplace dangerous.
Did she have tits like that?
The Queen Mother. Anne.
Best not to ask. Shouldn't even talk about it.
So what? I'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss.
I care only about Michelle. Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving? I could ask her in the carriage but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
Piglet? What are you?
Die? What...?
Fromberge...?! At the front?! No.
Raoul, no... You cannot do this. No matter how your heart is broken
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand. Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.
What is that?
Is that the king of king you wish me to be? Or do you say this because of your son?
Porthos told me.
Your mother's.
Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
Exactly why it should be given away.
You blush! You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
... Nothing.
Enough of this, our dinner waits.
This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead. You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption. Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
Wait, no! Do not be ashamed. The straits of your family need not be permanent. It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
My dear, I've already done it.
If you don't want to be so appealing, why did you touch the rose to your skin? Where was it? Here?
We'll burn in hell. Both of us.
Yeah I heard nothing came up.
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces... sabotage... until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
That's the point. He slipped up, and he's desperate now. And that means he's all the more dangerous.
Every step of the way.
The shit just hit the fan, brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me.
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
No I mean ours, motherfucker! If I go down everyone's going with me you and your crew especially! You won't get protection, you won't get the trucks nothing!
We're by Ozone...
What do you think?
Why didn't you call for back up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
Great. Well that changes a lot...
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
I don't know, shit. Maybe she was looking for love...
I'm sure you can handle it. Now I want to do an alley to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from Marine to 30th. Foot beat units continue on the boardwalk.
Nineteen eighty four. What fucking difference does it make?
Yeah...
Well don't you think that's odd?
Where do you come from, Marvosa?
Well why don't you sit this one and get some rest... you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS'APARTMENT NIGHT
Who am I? I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me. You understand? Where did you get the car!
Yeah, it was opened with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
Yeah... the guy was psycho I was just tying to protect the girl...
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like a real wacko.
Nothing! He didn't do nothing!
Yeah?
What? Wait a minute
That's great Zydowski, you tech guys are really on the ball. Harding call the print lab at the FBI, run the prints through their library, see if it's less screwed up than ours...
Well read this
Well let's get his ass to the garage! Some lead...
I don't know but he's from the FBI.
Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints we're on our way You coming?
LAPD data center reports a breach on the system. An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and Stanton... and yours too, Marvosa.
Where up north?
You got any family?
Only on dates?
Well you figured wrong! And now I'm public enemy number one. You have an answer for that?
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
What exactly did you see?
No, but I'm listening.
Didn't these professionals figure he had a girl in the room?
Found what?
I didn't know what to do but I knew I had something somebody would want. That's where I met him told him what I had. The FBI set me up with a new place... but the cops found me somehow. So I ran... and met you.
I took it with me. It's in a safe place.
Where the hell is my car?
Neither did I. I'll make it up to you, I promise...
No... I'm in some trouble...
Yeah...
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
Jesus, man...
Yeah, c'mon in... you scared the hell out of me!
Oh, shit, shit, shit I don't know about all this! You sure?!
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive? I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
Alright... alright... you've saved my ass enough times. What do you want to do?
Let's see what we got...
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe. If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta be careful that one's kind of tricky
Who knows? Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here... these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
And look at the balances... these aren't police salaries...
Shit, we just started. But I better log out of this.
Tubbs, these people mean business.
You must be going somewhere.
Mind if I come along for the ride?
Are you a regular there?
Ditched you?
Bartender said there are motels south of here.
What?
No. It wasn't like that!
Long gone... MARVOSA Well you won't mind if I don't take your word for it, right?
Oh yeah? You're a smart man?...
Nahhh...
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
It was you who did the asking.
I wouldn't presume to try.
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall. But I don't think he's psychic. What he has it empathy and projection. He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked. So do I. What do you want?
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven year old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his. 38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs'daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box. When Graham went to see her, she asked him through the speaker:'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind set, he may destroy himself. What are you planning, Jack?
I don't recommend it.
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper? In my Monkey Ward safehouse'cause I can't take my family home? This ends when I make it over.
Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana. Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!
He doesn't have anything to cut with.
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student. He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
At the end is the tail of what could be an'r.
' One hundred prayers'could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
No. Galatians 15: 2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6: 8 Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
Where?
We got an ad order in tonight's " Tattler " with'six six six'in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
' Dear Pilgrim, you honor me. '
' You're very beautiful.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
How much do you know?
Eighty six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces. None of them knew that;
Blond, right handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
Why not?
And I got you down here fixing fuckin'boat motors.
Last two like this we had, you caught.
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
You look all right now.
These are all dead, Will.
Get him to Atlanta.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
Mrs. Leeds'fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack. And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right? We'll get him one way or the other.
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever... If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
You think I'm gonna spot him'across a crowded room?'That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about. The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
... I'm going to see Lecktor.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Personal ads?
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
We will feel sick for a very long time.
What'd it say?
Tell me now.
Get me a plane...
Get me a plane!
I won't be here.
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven hour driving radius that also would've caught the'Tattler'early Tuesday morning.
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
When are you coming back?
It's a word. Killing them... His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time. And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
How do I know?!
There has to be.
Something Lecktor said.
It's not over yet.
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows.
See if there's another label underneath.
You're not going to need that. Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us.
Three minutes.
It's happening again, Jack...
Will. Get right back here. He just called.
For Christ's sake get him!
I don't understand.
I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.
Let's get straight who we've talking about. Are you the man I'm interested in?
He's right handed.
He's misunderstood.
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
I don't want to do that,
He asked how you are.
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma. You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
If I were?
I don't care. He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep. I love you...
At the store. You doin'some good?
Me, too. And very erotic...
Which part? That or the day to day.
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin'you about coming home, I just wondered.
To do what?
Yellow's a bad color for me. I'll look green at breakfast.
Blue is cold.
Do you remember what you said?
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
Then why?
Can you quit?
And... where are things?
Is Crawford going with you?
William: you are going to make yourself sick or get yourself killed.
Mama was probably asleep.
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer. I want to see you.
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Come home with me.
What's this Mama shit?
What's the problem, Molly?
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you. But they don't want to see me...
Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick...
Sure he is. Blond. Probably Scandinavian, too...
Yes. Is Molly there?
I know...'Out in the good air... '
Tell her I called.
That's right.
Thanks.
Lt. Fisk said...
Yes. Who are you?
Oh, Jesus... Come in. Honey...!
I can't thank you enough, I...
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?'He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
I figured I'd ask you...
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it. This guy wants to kill you?
Are you gonna kill him?
How did it happen?
How?
You went in the apartment?
She got all right?
And Hobbs died?
You like that Colombian stuff, don't you?
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
Of course, you don't. I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second raters, the lot.
And?
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Yes, I thought so.
Yes.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles. I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
Why should I tell you?
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle. He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF 13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground. I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face. Never mind, it's boring.
Pray tell.
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
What disadvantage?
You're very tan, Will.
Do you have the file with you
Pictures?
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
Do you dream much, Will?
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it. Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
It's not'interesting'. You thought of it before.
You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
I don't have one right now.
May I keep the file?
I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us. Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good? And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!
Why does it feel good?
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us. They told me you checked out a. 44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them?
Kevlar Second Chance.
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times '
Let's walk the route.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
That's... terrific! But I got something better. This is BIG... You are getting a once in a lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!
I'm Fonzie? GEORGE NO! The Fonzie! The crazy breakout character! The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part! ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into " Latka, " a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
No to the whole thing. None of it sounds good.
B but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha
LISTEN, you arrogant putz! I've been in this business for twenty years! I know! If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
They're IMPOSSIBLE!! Jesus! I mean " two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton "??! Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Eh, hi, Andy. Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
That's alright. Where...?
Tell you what. I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it
And that's great. But do it in LA and New York! There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage! I don't care!
Oh, you know the Bay Area! Always foggy!
" Funny "? I dunno. But " intriguing "... " mindboggling "... perhaps " headache inducing "... sure. Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...
That's because they've only seen it once. But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN... They'll catch on!
He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion. He'll kill you. First, you piss off women. Then you piss off the South. Then you get killed! And I did the bookings.
I I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large celled carcinoma.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
Tony Clifton.
Then he'll borrow it. I know Tony better than you do. Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!
Really?
You're firing me?? You don't even pay me!
I don't swear. I I don't do what everyone else does!
Oh!
B but I have them.
Ten.
I don't wanna talk about it!
I've never understood that. It's just... getting dark. But I like you! Hey! Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
I really want one. One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
I really want one. One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard on that large on national television.
Yes.
Oh, it's open.
Andy, you're not horrible. You're just... complicated.
Andy... there is no real you.
Have you told your family?
You're NOT DYING!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer!
And you're just poor white trash!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer!
And you're just poor white trash!
Each show is worse than the next.
So? What do they know?
They're asking for it.
It's so dirty.
You know, I always wanted to be a bad guy wrestler...
It's working for Elvis.
Hey that stuff gets written up in the papers
Well, call SAG. It'd be cool to get one on the show. I want the evening to build and build. It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the " Hallelujah Chorus " then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
No! NO NO NO! None of that! I want this show to be positive!
Goals are important.
We are all impressed.
Yes we do not doubt your devotion to TM. But we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically.
So HELP ME! All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
No, I'm serious. If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Yeah, I KNOW what I said! But trust me, it's not gonna happen!
Don't believe everything you hear.
Bob, Andy needs to RELAX. See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special. Something nice...
But what's the POINT? How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?
There!
That's the third white van I've seen.
I know, I know. This never happened. You don't exist.
Morpheus believes he is the One.
You don't, do you?
I intend to, believe me. Someone has to.
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle? She would know.
He had an accident.
Yes. You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future. But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
Oh, I disagree, Trinity. I disagree. I think the Matrix is more real than this world. I mean, all I do is pull a plug here. But there, you watch a man die.
No, it's all right.
Midnight watch.
Gee zus! What a mindfuck. You're here to save the world. You gotta be shitting me. What do you say to something like that?
You bet your ass. It keeps him going. Maybe it keeps all of us going.
Five. Since I've been here.
Dead. All dead.
Honestly. Morpheus. He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die. Little piece of advice: you see an agent, you do what we do; run. Run your ass off.
Cypher?
Just get me outta here.
Yes.
You have to focus. There is a phone. Wells and Lake. You can make it.
We have no choice.
Who's coming for me?
Right now?
How?!
Go! Now!
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are. If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
You're the One, Neo. You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
Go the the Adams Street bridge.
Please. Come. Sit.
I can see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
Yes. Thank you. But I think we both know there's more to it than that. Do you believe in fate, Neo?
Why not?
I know exactly what you mean.
Do you want to know what it is?
That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind.
Be what? Be real?
When?
Yes. A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age. I say almost funny.
Your training.
Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
No you don't. Did you see the woman in the red dress?
Look again.
I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall. Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air. Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world. Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
The beginning?
And she knows what? Everything?
How does she know?
And she's never wrong.
She helped you?
What did she tell you?
I told you I don't believe in this stuff. No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
What do I believe it? Are you kidding me? What do you think? I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't. The whole world, my entire life was a lie. I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
Why? So I can hear some old lady tell me, what? That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world? Come on. How do I respond to that? I can't. It's ridiculous. I mean who am I? I'm nobody, I'm just a guy. What did I do, Morpheus? Why me?
And you still believe I'm the One?
Yeah? What about the other five guys? The five before me? What about them?
I know. That is why it is so important for you to go. Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
We need an exit.
We're on our way
You're the Oracle?
Yeah.
What vase?
Not too bright though.
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
Sorry, kid. You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
Your next life, maybe. Who knows. That's how these things go.
I know. Poor Morpheus. Without him we are lost. We will never find the One.
You're going to have to make a final choice. In one hand, you will have Morpheus'life. In the other hand, you will have your own. One of you is going to die. Which one, will be up to you.
I know a lot about you. I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
My name is Trinity.
That was a long time ago.
What?
Most guys do.
Of what?
Who is?
When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question. They have to see it to believe it.
From what?
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road. You know exactly where it ends.
I used to eat there... Really good noodles.
But an Oracle can.
Is it?
Should I be?
What did she tell you?
What happened? What did you see?
How much like it? Was it the same cat?
We have to!
You can't!
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out! There's no way you're going back in!
What?
No, Neo. That's not true. It can't be true.
Because...
No, you're not.
You moved like they moved. I've never seen anyone move that fast.
You will tonight. I guarantee it. I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
Zion?
It's a city?
Where is it?
Hell yes!
How?
How much time?
Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix. They are used only in emergencies. If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system. It would be the end of everything.
Does it? I don't know. This can't be just coincidence. It can't be! Can it?
The Oracle. She told me this would happen. She told me...
Why?
Cypher, I thought
Got it.
Dozer?
Trinity, we don't have any other choice.
An Agent! You have to send me back!
Know where he is?
Great... great... listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown... and maybe we can work something out...
Of course,'The Season of the Witch'won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.
Nothing's private...
You got sparklers?
Yeah, yeah, never mind. You gotta be careful.
Ok. For another  5. 00 a special on the packs.
I gotta get the stuff.
Nobody sees where I get the stuff. That's good business. I'll be back in thirty minutes.
A check? What the... hey, where you kids from?
Look who's talking. Pretentious bullshit. Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh?
Salute!!!
' Thou sayest it; I am a king. This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice. '
How do you know?
Sure she is. She's always in here with some different guy. You know the way they are.
Ok... but go to a movie first or something... not good to be driving around right away. You know you can't do much for him now... it's out of your hands.
I know, I know, stupid. I mean where you goin'?
So?
Nervous?
You flew before?
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me. My mother can send me some. I don't know.
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself. I'll write.
I'll say that I'm travelling.
Hey... no more good times like before. Until you come back.
Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.
It'll be OK I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
I was in the basement fixing the pipes. Would you believe that?
What pipes... the ones from last year... those pipes.
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that. I don't need this aggravation. I'm getting old.
I should know? His wife don't even know. Probably off with one of his little girls... I don't know. I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn... Why should I kill myself?
What can I say?
Nope...
Look... I don't know. What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something? Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head. Right?
I know that Charlie but look at my side. You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him. What happens if this kid don't pay me? I gotta collect from you? I don't want to do that. I made a deal with him not you, right?
OK.
You getting out too?
Look... I've talked to him and I've talked to him... what more can I do...? Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head... ok?
We'll settle it tonight.
How much?
Let's go to the movies... on you.
 500. He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest... it's almost  3, 000.
Charlie, this is business.
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place... Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs... and I mean it.
You said it.
No, I'm serious... You're really good.
In a little while... I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place... not here... much nicer than this... uptown... sort of nite club and restaurant and everything.
No... no stripping... as the hostess.
Yeah, you know... you greet the people... see them to their tables... well... it'll be different though... Listen... why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
Ok. Chinese. We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
Bye.
About that shooting last night... I was there and...
You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
Hemmingway. Killed himself. I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
... The one who's sick, right? In the head.
Who knows? It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like. When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad... you know I'm " cumpari " with them... so I take an interest. You live next door, keep an eye open... but don't get involved.
Nothing.
" Francis Macomber. "
" Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber. "
Do you have enough?
I don't mind.
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself. God willing.
Maybe, who knows.
Nobody knows anything, believe me.
You know... like restaurants, night clubs...
Don't ask.
No.
It doesn't make any sense. He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy... not unless it was personal.
It's still sick.
Ok.
Yeah... but don't worry about that now. The Hemmingway one is first.
Take your time. I don't care.
That's the word... preoccupied.
No. Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
Watch your language.
I can take care of myself. You know that.
Of all people. Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara. C'mon.
The green capsules in the top drawer.
Honey, I can't talk now... I've gotta run, bye.
Can you spare it?
Thanks.
... I'm here, aren't I? Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting. What's on the table for discussion? Party favors, flowers hi Dad, hi Drew
... I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me. Ever since Joe showed. It's like he dropped from the clouds...
His wife?
Very.
Have you got a minute?
Fireworks. Update we're con structing the number'65'on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
But it's your birthday.
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty five years without having to be reminded of it.
I know you do, darling.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart. I can'tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
From the Korean War.
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included the RSVP's are amazing. A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
That's okay, Daddy.
Who's Annie?
I don't like cake.
Oh, the goddam party
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar. The'B's for Beluga, the'P'for Petrossian. Of course, they also stand for'Bill'and for'Parrish'.
Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room. I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
They respect you. Isn't that a kind of love?
I wasn't going to say
Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's. You too, Drew. We've still got some loose ends
Honey!
What will I tell Annie?
And that?
9: 30's almost 10: 30. Where I come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.
Red or white?
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
Left field somewhere. Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes
Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications. I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
Toast? No... just the butter.
You don't mean that. You wouldn't disappoint Daddy
Drew, you're out of line.
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me. And vice versa. Okay?
So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
You're taking this too far, Drew.
He'll wait
I didn't say.
' Here'?
The Board of Parrish Communications is hereby called to order. Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and
Hot or cold.
And a glass.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
It doesn't matter.
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
The dagger?
' Thoughts'? Not a one but I did hear a voice last night.
In my sleep.
' Yes'.
Maybe, who knows? You know how voices are. Let's go.
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince
It's going to be great
Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop Instead it was
You have a way with words.
Olympic.
Is there any more to it?
Like'Smith'or'Jones '
That's your privilege, Bill. But given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu ture, the truth is... joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as Death and Taxes.
Glad I could be of some help.
Sit down, Drew.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
Well now it's undone, okay? Forget Bontecou! Scrub him! I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it.
Please. Don't worry about him. And above all, don't antagonize him.
Sure.
What are their feelings?
Over my dead body.
With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either. What I am inter ersted in is how my Board got conven ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal. No, thank you.
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
Are you running this Board or am I?
Is this Mr. Black's fantasy? Another one of his whoppers? Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
I know. Gum up the works.
Never mind Bontecou. I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
We'll do it together. I'll clue you in. Timing's got to be right. The old man says it's up to Joe.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what he said.
He was interested.
The timing yes. He says it's up to Joe.
That's what he said.
But I didn't mean to do it!
He said that?
Yeah, the short, gray hairs.
What you then?
You wait here'n to take us? Like you bus driver to dere?
Some spot you pick.
Doctor lady make it irey.
Can't, sistah.
No, I come to see Doctor.
Nuthin'.
My Doctor Lady?
I am.
She knows how she feel.
Don'need you okayin'.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Can do no right by people. Come to take, you wan'to stay, leave you stay, you wan'to go. Rahtid!
Lunch is'in'today, have you given it any thought 
Nothing?
Jennifer.
The Board is waiting.
Didn't you call a Board meeting?
You bet. I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety one.
Thanks.
Confused, huh? About what?
' Love'? Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
Oh yes, I do.
I was a world class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl and for some reason she took me in.
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls and then you're free.
Free to love each other. Com pletely. Totally. No fear.
Can't seem to escape you today.
I am Joe.
That is not my intention.
What kind of childhood did you have?
Come again?
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
No, Joe, I'm swimming here. Then I'm going home.
I've got plenty of friends.
I can see why.
I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.
Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
I came to see you.
Very well, I'll watch.
Whatever you do.
And I'll be a visitor.
I don't mind
Well, now I am sorry. For intruding on you this afternoon.
I appreciate you
I mean I appreciate that.
I adore things like that.... food I can't do without. Don't you?
Yes... I've found that it does.
Has her pain abated?
I'm sorry to hear that.
No.
No.
' To bed'?
Why, yes. Thank you.
Well... I'm uh, Joe. And you're Susan. And I uh have this weak feeling in my knees
Faster. And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me forever.
Yes, he's tired. I believe so.
More than you love peanut butter?
For how long?
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
No worse than it gets for me. I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
But there's so much to tell you
Will it?
' Love will find out the way'?
I believe that, don't you?
Hold me
Thank you for loving me.
You think so?
Shook me up. I mean that you knew her and everything
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
I wish you had said something to me about staying here
No.
How long have I got?
... I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
No
Closer than that.
And uh I guess,'goodnight'.
How are you? How're you feeling?
Um well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy. This is the left field thing of all time. What do I do? What do I tell my family?
Sounds fair enough.
A'deal'?
You've got a deal.
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
So you've grasped the idea. Con gratulations. Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
How about giving a guy a break?
There's one to every rule.
I'm not everybody.
What's it like where I'm going?
Yes.
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem ber of the Board.
Yes, I am. There's a research lib rary on the fourth floor. Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something. I know I'll be seeing you.
Uh huh.
Well... I don't know.
Okay.
Easy, Bill. You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
You were just curious?
About Susan?
What way would you put it?
How about you telling me? When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer. That's what I'm used to. Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
Um not right now.
What's okay?
Never mind. I'm tired. I'm going to take a nap.
I'll be the judge of that.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
' Spooning'?
I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to how shall I say instruct. You've lived a first rate life. And I find it eminently usable.
Any universe that exists or ever existed. You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are. And you're all fucked up.
And I don't give a shit.
Cut the'Bill'crap out you sonofabitch.
I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for has served its purpose.
Good. Tomorrow, after the party.
You'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it. And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates. And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death.
I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
I love her, Bill. She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
Then what is it?
Which is what?
So that's what love is?
Those were my words, Bill.
No.
Are you threatening me?
It's not necessary, Joe. Drew's going to step aside
He is
An IRS man.
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here of course that's not his real name smelled out your involvement, Drew. He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence. Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest
An offense
Yes.
You're coming to'take me'. What is that? Who the hell are you?
That's me.
The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took. Let me ask your opinion. Do I blend in?
I do? How long will you be staying?
And then?
It just occurred to me
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
I didn't ask any question.
Try. Because'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
No, you're not. You're trying to'handle'the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
Please. Talk to me
What do you mean?!
Know what? Know what, goddammit!
Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest. Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
' Take me'...? Where?
' The one'to do what?
Get what?
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm sorry
What question?
The'question '
How're you doing?
I am, this is it. B Day.
Bontecou Day. Going to close with Big John Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed. I want to talk to you about them next week.
Yeah. Or the week after.
See. There. What'd I tell you?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
I'm going to stick it out here. We still have a shot.
Fine, fine. Big doing up here. Why are you still down here?
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope less, it's over. Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this
If you're trying to show me lay down in front of the bus loyalty, forget it.
Okay, Eddie anyway, thanks for the memory.
We're all ears.
Drew told me.
I hope so.
Yeah. I guess so.
Thank God. Now could we go? Let's get this day started.
Forget about me and Mom are you going to marry him?
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful
Well, I wasn't going to say that
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
That's for me. I'm talking about you. It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Oh yes, I am. Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
Well, it worries me. I want you to get swept away. I want you to levitate. I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
Be deliriously happy. Or at least leave yourself open to be.
Aw, you're tough.
Stay open. Who knows? Lightning could strike.
You're terrible.
Well, go get'em, Pops.
What?!
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for. Drew's a good man. I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate
Nothing.
Then what is it?
Love. Passion. Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for. Well, they've arrived.
You don't know anything about Joe
I don't know, I can't say
In this case, I can't. I uh I just can't help you. I only would tell you that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground.
Daddy
Oh yeah? What was'fascinating'about it?
My kid sister. She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
Nothing to be sorry about. That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
Nothing lasts.
Why?
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that'nothing lasts'stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy. He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it. One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
Damn right. Looking for her right now. Who knows? You might be her.
Me? Internal medicine.
' Her'.
I've got patients coming in
I know what you're saying. Doesn't pay very well. Depends on the woman I marry. Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap
I would.
No, it was so right it scares me.
Why?
Because I like you so much. Now I've got to go.
Y'didn't?
That's it?
Whatever gets you off.
What can I do for you, Leonard?
Burt.
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
Condition?
Amnesia?
Like waking. Like you always just woke up. 
So you're holding my calls?
He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?
No, let's go.
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
You're still paying for it. It's still Your room.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say. 
You did.
Where'd you get it?
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
Do you remember me?
You Jimmy Grantz? 
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Look, there's two hundred grand stashed in the car. Just take it!
I don't want your fucking money!
You did explain, Lenny.
Is that what your little note says?
Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear.
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
 So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.   The world doesn't disappear when you  close your eyes, does it? My actions  still have meaning, even if I can't  remember them. My wife deserves  vengeance, and it doesn't make any  difference whether I know about it. 
Why?
She was beautiful. Perfect to me 
It's isolated.
I wasn't helping you for money.
You know what we have in common?
Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
So I just take your word?
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
What?
Course not.
Such as?
Your wife?
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
What are you gonna do?
And?
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Yeah, I hated it.
Why would you do that?
Who?
What does he want?
Did you?
What's this all about?
I'm not.
How?
What?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
That's different.
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
Shut the fuck up!
Dying.
I remember my wife dying.
A BEER, please.
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
Oh. But haven't we met before?
My boyfriend told me about you.
Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
My name's Leonard. 
I don't know.
Teddy!
Shut your mouth!
Yeah, it's just this fucked up building.  Why are we going there?
Lenny, is that you?
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
Things change.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
Who?
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
Why?
You're living.
I might have fallen asleep before I did.
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
I don't know.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Give me your keys.
You like it? Let's trade.
Natalie who?
Prove it.
Who's she?
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
She couldn't.
I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
Why?
What sort of questions?
Like what?
I have money.
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
Why not?
How do you know this?
How do you know him?
Maybe. Maybe just.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. " learning through repetition "
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.
But he's not the right guy! 
Why? You're never going to know. 
No, you won't.
You won't remember!
I thought so too! I was sure you'd  remember. But you didn't. 
I'm not. I was the cop assigned to your  wife's death. I believed you, I thought  you deserved the chance for revenge. I helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night. The guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife.  We found him and you killed him.  MEMENTO Green Revisions 10 4 99 115A.

A C. I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force. Name of Alonzo Stevens. Now, he's YOUR informant. Stevens, called us. I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on. I do not know what he is talking about. But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad. Right now...
How do I know? I got the call from Alonzo on an open line. That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven forty seven o'clock Friday night. Okay? I am trying to alert you, here. You know whether or not... you have a thing goin'down. I do not. But we know this guy. I think you know this guy. Normally, he is cool. Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical. That engenders foreboding. Do you understand the meaning of the word " foreboding "? As in badness is happening to your deal right fucking now?
Meet and greet. " I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours? "
That's right.
Never heard of him.
What are you talking about?
I have faith. In horoscopes and fortune cookies...
If they ran the rental car or lease on this place... even if it's EPIC database in El Paso... they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep. Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves...
Yeah.
On the phone.
They had me from the gate.
After I check on Francine and the boys, then I'm gone. Sonny, tell Rico I'm so sorry. I wanted you to know...
Alonzo...!
White supremacist types.
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
You sure?
Nothing. Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
What flowers?
" Salutations from the south... "
... you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious, they make mistakes. You're worried about me. Do not be. I am careful. I am cool. I got Trudy, backup, whatever. You worry about you. Because you are the ones who are in denied territory, not me. If your focus is on me, you'll miss something coming at you. That's how people slip up. Get hurt. And I'd die if anything happened. You worry about you. You and Sonny... are in the dangerous place. I'm fine...
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
They've been targeted. And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
I like the diminished risk. It frees up capital reserves. I like working with self interested businessmen who are competent. You can predict their behavior....
Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is  6, 000, 000. Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front loaded costs we pickup. For this kind of weight, the balance of 80  is when our buyer picks up the load. Transactions are offshore. Dollars or euros. Secure internet transfers. We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided... No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U. S. soil... That's the deal.
Of course! That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.
They will kill you. And then they will kill your wife, too.

You sure you heard what I said?
Yeah?
Must be some mess back there.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
I'm sorry. I thought you were never mind I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
What'll we do? Leave now or what? Your place or mine? Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you?
I know. Scribbage!
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
Okay. Never argue with a man.
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
I show you what problem
Same all around! For my friend, too!
For money.
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
Oh hell, forget it.
Forget it.
You inviting shee it.
Oh. Guess I got the wrong impression.
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
I been sick. Hold this, will ya?
Don't rush me. How I do it, see, I get myself primed, like I was turning on the charm for some pretty little blonde lady, then kinda mosey away slow and easy and swing around! and there you are, you handsome devil.
Who'd you ever do a favor for? You just let some poor bastard freeze to death, wouldn't you?
You wanna know the truth? You dumb bastard, I got it for you. Look at it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me.
Respect shee it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
Did I say that? Did I? It don't say nothing about you...
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess.
You couldn't lift fly specks from a sugar bowl. Can you hold this?
Well, I don't think I can walk. I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
I'm scared.
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you if you can't ah, Christ!
I don't know. Cops. Or the how should I know?
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
Yeah.
I read it.
Keep the goddam blanket on.
Sounds like they knew you.
You're what?
Hell, don't cry about it!
It's so exciting. New York. The mad forward thrust of everything. My sense of time here is completely altered.
What you got me up here for?
You want me to leave?
I'm going to Florida.
I simply don't have it, Joe.
You're wasting your time. There's nothing in there.
Take it, easy, boy... Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Ready for hard work, son?
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged!
Right here, why not? I prayed in saloons, I prayed in the street, I prayed an the toilet. He don't care where, what He wants is that prayer.

No, don't let her! I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Don't worry about it. Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
How do you like it? Istanbul?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
How far?
Sixty Lira?
No! I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
How much?
Okay! Ley me out right here. I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you. I'll walk it.
Yes...?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Yes. I think so.
Four planes in four days... but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers... and what with our people kicking up a shit storm'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
Just what?
How much did you figure to make?
I was just going to sell it to friends. I'm not a pusher, honest.
What's your father do?
Be tough on'em.
It's not fair!
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.

The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
Get the... midnight... express.
I don't know. It's someplace down in there...... deep.. A big door... a wheel....
Jimmy?
We go back, seal it up again, and come in tomorrow night every night'till we get out of here. There's gotta be a way. Those bats got out someplace. Now let's go. Doubletime!
I got some acid man. Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something.
What?
Oh we... we...
Whose?
It's already been cut.
What?

Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again. You go on through, I'll catch up.
You're right.
No!
For Christ's sake, just GET on the plane, okay!
You're ayip!
But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea. You rip us off on the hash.
Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
Learn what?
You'Merican. You don't know.
I don't hear you bitch about the money.
I know exactly what you feel but you must not worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right judge, I arrange everything just right. And I think we get you bail. If very bad, maybe twenty month sentence... But I think we get you bail...
Did you ask for bail?
The lawyer?
Oh Yesil... Yesil's his name but I... don't know anything...'bout... Yesil...

Fine. You want me to call your supervisor?
20 minutes. Susan?
What?
Leonard, listen. I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back. Look, I'm trying to help you here...
I'm sorry. But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
It doesn't matter, all right? It's dead.
What do you?
You don't do that, we're on the wrong track. You...
Manny never threw the coupling switch!! We're goin'the wrong way!!!
No...
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father... I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
You did!
You know what I mean...
Don't you get it? It's more than that.
Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
Right.
Why take the chance? Just let me go down there with you...
I know. But if it was carrying something... there's a chance you could have been exposed.
Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
Just do it!!
It worked before...
That's why we should do it now.
I can. We can do this...
Talk to me.

Watch your step, Siri. Your grant could be on the line here.
What?
I have no idea. Are you ready?
And they're not fully developed. This thing's not even an adult.
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
What do you want to know?
Thank you.
It's right this way.
I'm not much of a critic.
Sure.
Sounds good.
You got a point there...
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay. My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm
They're called Novril they're for your pain.
Of course you will. And your arm will be fine, too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but I finally popped it back in there. But what I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs. Considering what I had around the house, I don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better.
Don't move now wouldn't want to hurt this neck Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
Lucky for you, I did. Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels...
You want to read it?
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
What's it about?
Oh, like I could do that?
No, what is it?
I can take it, go ahead.
Pretty rough so far.
The profanity bothers you?
Well, these are slum kids, I was a slum kid, everybody talks like that.
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours. Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning. What a wonderful first page just to read the name Misery Chastain...
... it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
No. No, it isn't, it's oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would " great " be insulting?
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me But when I got Misery here, everything Changed she just makes me smile so.
I'm on page three hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
Yeah, that and Misery's Child those are the only two divine things ever in this world...
I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work days, nights night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems.'Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that too.
Done?
No problem.
It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment.
Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me.
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
Then who did?
She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery.
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.
Yes.
You want me to burn my book?
This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.
So you've indicated. Do it.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril. How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
Great.
You fooler...! Did I do good?
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
Thank you for thinking of me. Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
Are you sure?'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? " You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on this paper, Annie. " Well, I'll get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here, Mister Man.
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
It'll only take a second.
Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration.
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
That's right when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
I know that, Mister Man they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know. Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, " This isn't what happened last week have you all got amnesia? THEY JUST CHEATED US THIS WASN'T FAIR "
But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any " experimental blood transfusion " that saved her life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
You can you have the " gotta "
The " gotta. " Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the " gotta. "
You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page. You know, " I'gotta'know will she live, " " I'gotta'know will he catch the killer. " " I gotta see how this chapter ends. " You said it. I don't usually buy that magazine. I only got it,'cause they were interviewing you.
Nothing.
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Not even a hint?
I'm going to play my records all day
Oh...
Oh. You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.
Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine.
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
Well, it certainly says you.
Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice.
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
You've been out of your room.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
Don't talk to me like that.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd be dead in the snow if it wasn't for me?
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man gland if you're not nicer
That's disgusting.
It's almost done. By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
Paul, this will be our legacy.
What things?
I was fooling, silly. You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne. Dome Pear igg non.
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
Ahh!!!
Four or five days ago. Why?
It was an old car those dents could have been there forever.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice.
They're hauling Misery into court.
" There is a justice higher than that of man I will be judged by Him. "
How many times do I have to tell you I have a system here. Where the hell is that thing?
That thing. Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
There's that spice again.
Yes.
Yes, he is.
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels?
I hate that I made this call tell me I'm being silly.
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time'65 Mustang said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
Answer me a couple things?
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Newspapers?
Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business
Marcia, please.
Marcia, you know I started " Misery " on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever. For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness? I'm doing this because I have to. Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts because if I can make it work... I might just have something that I want on my tombstone.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
Right don't go too far ahead of me now
Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago.. The question is, do you trust her?
Where is it?
How grateful?
On what.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
Magic...
And my room?
What made you pick that nag? She'd never won a bloody thing.
Say no more. I'm off to grab a drink. Still favor Bellinis?
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled. I need time.
Sort it all out.
A change of plans?
Oh, no, not at all. Maybe just a bit.
Lovely.
In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz. G'day.
What are you talking about?
Where?
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint. Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off. You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Oh. then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the CDC scientists in Atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti virus and still have it be effective. You knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for.
What was the top bid?
Than thirty seven million pounds? Not really.
In any case we don't want your cash.
Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options. We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options. Your stock's never sold above thirty one dollars a share. We'll agree to buy at fifty.
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
Or hard wired, right. First line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house. Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet. Basically impenetrable, I'd say.
Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.
Unless we dose her with Bellerophon on the next ninety seven minutes, Nyah will kill herself. So, first things, first. Swanbeck said there's no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts.
.. in the building...
Right. Just remember, mates. Billy Baird's the name. Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.
No. You just looked as if you did.
Oh. Well. I think that can be arranged.
There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
Uh huh.
I see. You're not just another pretty face..
This is very disconerting..
Right..
Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer. we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow. Shall we?
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
May I say something, no offence? You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Sounds smashing. I'm in. Muchacho, mi carro, por favor! Now be serious. You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
Where did you get this number? I don't even have it!
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority. I can make them go away.
Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?
Who wants to be decent?..
They've got a book for this?
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth. He'd lie about his favorite color. But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard. All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
That's not the point. In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
That they're lying.
I don't know that they'pinched'it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
That's because I'm on my back.
There's nearly 2 million in London.
That's lot of people out there.. how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..
So would I. But it's not mine to give.
Something like that.
No. You can be a thief and have a conscience: Not me. Why did you have to tell me about this! What do I have to do to get away from this guy? When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment.. even now I'll be at some out of the way place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does. And it looks like he's done it again. You know his definition of a true paranoid?
Someone in possession of all the facts. Are you telling me I have to do this?
And that's the only reason?
Not me. I was just hoping you might.. or that.. somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
Much.
Probably that I needed him in some urgent way.. destitute in serious trouble.. the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..
Well, I mean it's not a total loss. It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
You don't trust me.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735. It's going to be delayed.
You'll be fine. I'm going to lose you.
Well, forewarned is forearmed. And while we're at it, be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose's plans, especially any involving you..
Just like old times?
Have you met them?
I've no doubt.
I'll muddle through.
He's touched your heart. You're overwhelmed. You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month. If You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in and getting you out. Give me the ear piece.
It's going to be okay.
What? You told me to get out of here. I thought you were here to collect me. I was so relieved.
No.
No.
No...
Well. You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Like what?
You gotta be kidding.
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry. And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier. So let's get on with it. He's still in Sydney?
What did you think of him?
Not necessarily.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
' Terrorists? '
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane. Locating him in time to stop something like that
Excuse me?
And then what?
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
Very.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Yes, I believe that's right.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
Brave girl. If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice. But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her. After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law. And Hunt. However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera. Bring it back alive.
No. I can't afford to be curious. And neither can you, Hunt..
Why not? You've done just about everything else on this operation.
Of course it was. Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there. You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days. At any rate, it's been most instructive what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face. Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus. Not even antibodies.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti virus, Bellerophon.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus. I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
I do.
I don't. No exactly.
Not sure. Some sort of vacation. I'll let you know where I'm going.
The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.
Why not?
Roger that.
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
I told her to get outta there.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Copy. She's only got twenty eight minutes left. Track ahead and pick her up.
Dimitri Miediev... Dimitri Miediev...
What can we do, Barnes? Put a guy at the airport? How many identities do you think Hunt has? How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries? These guys are trained to be ghosts. We taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
Let's not waste time chasing him. Make him come to us. Everybody  s got pressure points. Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.
Okay!
What  s Hunt doing on the TGV?
But why tell us?
What kind of show.
Maybe we don  t have to know what he looks like. If he  s got that list, he  s going to want to check it. We should be looking for laptops.
Why the masquerade? Why take the risk? Well, Claire, you  ve asked the question and you are the answer.
Fold it. Fold it tight.
Yes.
If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox? I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA.
Stay out of this. OR Lachez moi OR T'agueue
I want to sleep. Can I sleep here.
I'm walking.
Sleeping's better.
Oh yeah?
Shut up! I saw you. You were in the car.
Don't give me that! I was on the bridge.
There was nobody on the bridge.
What?
That was four hours ago! Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Did they send you... Did they send you?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
We've got seventy five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him. I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
What kind of help?
I didn't say that.
I just need you to be safe.
What about me Jim called an abort I didn't comply. I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
Okay...
Yes....... come here.... viens pres moi...
Two cars. Where are you?
Ethan?
Claire.
I always have, Claire..
Who  s dead?
Are you damaged?
Are you intact?
Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay? Were you followed?
Yes.
You  re in Prague?
No sir.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
Yes. I see your point.
What?
I don't quite follow you.
You're right. Maybe this'll save some time.
That's right. Max, it seems, has two unique gifts a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as " Job 314 ". The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley. " Golitsyn " was a lightning rod, one of ours.
Yes, the mole's deep inside. And like you said. You survived.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
It's Hunt. What do you need for a pinpoint? Been watching a little T. V., have you?
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
What kind?
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
I can't just hack my way inside. There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand alone. I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
What makes you trust me?
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
It's hard to tell. I'm gonna have to be close.
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
You're more than that, Luther. They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it. They want you back in.
You didn't tell'em at the debriefing?
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just not long enough. Gotta catch my flight.. So. How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Well, Luther if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.
Really? And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
The penny drops. You are not Job. Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone aggressive but playful. Job is not playful. So you're something of a paradox.
On what?
It's quite out of the question.
And how might you know that? Are you another Company man?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
Why, may I ask?
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Why should I?
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and see if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
Mm Hmmm...
Very good.
What was your deal with Job?
Ten million. Ten million in negotiable U. S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached. And one more thing your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
The possibility alone is worth ten million. Baggage car, rack 3. Silver briefcase. Combination 314.
I wouldn  t worry about him. Once you  ve got the money he  ll find you.
IMF mainframe.
In Langley.
Time up.
Stairway, you  re wrapped, go to transport.
Right, right. Good.
No, we  re going to recover the disk, understand?! Now move!
You wish to meet Max? This is the price of admission.
Then what am I doing here?
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
I'm willing to take the chance.
I thought I'd take some now.
Oh? What's the problem?
Tell you what?
What problem?
I guess.
Why not?
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
He won't be back in a hurry?
Sure. If the main character does.
No. Abort.
They  re covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications. Repeat. Cut all radio communications.
But you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
So I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England.. it was easy.
Hey, I showed'em to you!
How did Kittridge do it?..
What  s going to make him do that?
Jesus, Ethan. Good for you.
Tight security. No guns. Real plus.
I usually am.
You got it.
Good luck.
No, in your... ear piece. You have a lovely smile. Can you hear me now?
What's going on?
Why don't you take a look?
That's what we do isn't it?
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Try it again.
Is something wrong with the phone? Well is something wrong with the batteries?
Run it through from the top.
The Shawfish?
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
Again? Johnny Cammareri.
Rita. Pass the wine.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
You're welcome.
I want you to stop seeing her.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
I don't wanna talk about it.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
You're not sleepy?
Pop, I got news.
You look tired.
I'm getting married.
Yeah.
The guy died.
He got hit by a bus.
Johnny Cammareri.
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
In a month.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
Yeah.
It's temporary.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
I got it done.
What are you doing here?
You're married.
You're my father.
I don't know whether I saw you or not.
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
I brought you something.
I'm wearing your bracelet.
What's wrong can never be made right.
Why?
You are going to marry my brother?
I have no life.
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!
That's it.
I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget?
You don't have to help me.
I like it well done.
Where'd Johnny find you?
How'd he die?
Fast.
When you get engaged?
I don't know.
No.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
How many men since then?
Stupid yourself.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
Why you talking to me?
Yes.
I'm a wolf?
What are you doing!
Stop it!
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
A bride without a head!
To the bed.
I was dead.
Loretta.
I've got you.
What about Johnny?
Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
I don't know. I think it's the moon.
It makes you look like an angel.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
I'm marrying your brother!
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
You don't get along with anybody!
What did I do?
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
Why not?
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
I'm telling you you can't.
But that's cause he don't know!
What?
What are you talking about?
Alright.
Alright. Where's the Met?
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Thank you.
Kinda gaudy.
I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.
I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
You're making me feel guilty again.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
I'm here!
We're here.
This is where we're going!
The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
I'm really afraid.
I'm afraid of who I am.
And you're not now?
Let me go home.
Let me go home.
I'm freezing to death.
He's coming.
Ronny, please...
I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
Will you marry me.
Right.
Yeah, I'll be in.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
Pop.
Why not?
What's thirty seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty seven. It ain't over till it's over.
And we'll sell the house.
No. He don't.
Did he tell her?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
What! How do you know?
Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.
Your hair's different.
Are you drunk?
No. But I have a hangover.
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
He's with his dying mother!
WHAT!! She was dying!
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
Oh God, that's too bad.
What's the matter with him?
No.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fianc , and once I bounced a check at the liquor store but that was really an accident.
I... a... slept with my fianc 's brother.
I know.
I know.
Alright.
My son does not like this Johnny Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.
He should pay.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
Talk to him.
Did you see the moon last night?
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Are you sure?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N. Y. U.
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Yes.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
Then why are you eating alone?
Go ahead.
Nerves.
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
What you don't know about women is a lot.
I guess you can't invite me in?
People home.
I'm a little cold.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Look.
It's Cosmo's moon.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner. Is he down there? No.
Cosmo.
I don't know.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!
Bring her forward.
Burn them.
No, no, It floats. Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her. To the pond.
Bread? No, no, no. Apples.... gravy... very small rocks...
What? Ridden on a horse?
You're using coconuts!
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
Where did you get the coconuts?
Found them? In Mercea. The coconut's tropical!
Well, this is a temperate zone.
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
Am I right?
King of the WHO?
Who are the Britons?
Well, who is your lord?
What?
Well, I didn't vote for you.
Well, how did you become king, then?
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table. Whose castle is this?
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest, and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
What?
Well... can we come up and have a look?
Well, what are you then?
My liege... forgive me...
Then I dub you... Sir Bedevere... Knight of the Round Table!
OF course, my Liege...
Who... Who breaks out?
Ni, ni, ni!
Ni!
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
You know my name?
That is our quest. You know much that is hidden O Tim.
A Grail?
Follow!
There he is!
Behind the rabbit?
... You silly sod.
You got us all worked up.
Charge!
Man. I'm sorry. Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
What?
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior...
Oh, very nice. King, eh! I expect you've got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food. And how d'you get that? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our society! If there's EVER going to be any progress...
... But all the decision of that officer...
... must be approved at a bi weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
... but a two thirds majority...
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Ah! NOW... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Oh, Did you hear that! What a give away.
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Yes, Lord.
Good idea, O Lord!
You're not. You'll be stone dead in a few minutes.
I feel happy... I feel happy.
And another!
Oh, well... er brave Concorde! You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
Good Concorde... stay here and rest awhile.
Really, I feel fine, sir.
It just seems silly... me lying here.
They cost fifty pounds each!
I can understand that.
Gosh Is he all right?
I can explain... I was in the forest... riding north from Camelot... when I got this note.
No! Not the curtains, lad... All that... all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys... as far as the eye can see and beyond... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
Father, lad.
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing. All I had when I started was swamp... other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same... just to show'em. It sank into the swamp. So I built a another one... that sank into the swamp. I built another one... That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp.... So I built another... and that stayed up.... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
Rather what?
You're not going to do a song while I'm here!
Herbert.
But I don't like her.
I know... but... I want the girl that I marry to have... a certain... special... something...
Not you.
How?
Er...  You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Er... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
You must see the doctors immediately. You must lie down.
Quick!
You are in great peril.
Look I'm fine!
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
It's too perilous.
... I Bet you're gay.
There's nothing wrong with... that.
I'm sorry, I must go.
Well... yes...
Well... yes... but I hadn't realised...
Well, let's not jump to conclusions...
What's he do? Nibble your bum?
Shut up.
Bravely ran away, away.
When danger reared its ugly head, He bravely turned his tail and fled Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about And gallantly he chickened out Bravely taking to his feet He beat a very brave retreat Bravest of the brave Sir Robin Petrified of being dead Soiled his pants then brave Sir Robin Turned away and fled.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
I speak as I find, Archie.
Not bad, not bad.
Sixty.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
She loved him.
What?
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
Aye? Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
Aye, but will they?
The woman's surrounded by fools! She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning. Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
Don't be an idiot! You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
She'll get over it.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you? Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
When are you gonna see it, John? She doesn't give a damn about you.
She means it.
Be careful who sees it.
It's what the maids are for.
It's cold out there tonight, Barney.
Good man. And is she all right?
Good. She's a good girl. Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl. And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
Are you all right, Barney?
Have you met Mr Lyle? He's in sugar...?
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water. She's having a bust cast of him. In Nero Marquino marble.
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me. She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs. But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence. The Tory Party has always been our party.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition. Du Royaum Uni.
Convey her a message.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
Do you know who you address, sir?
The future King!
No dinners, Bertie. Why are you dressed for outdoors?
Cold is good Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose. It has been a smoking room by tradition ever since father
Mama...
Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant.
I'm sorry?
You'll be sent a message.
Her Highness'Equerry.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
No.
Yes, it most certainly is!
That can wait till the weekend.
It can wait. Anything else?
Don't think I can't persuade her.
This is a slur on her good name.
Nobody has any rights over me.
Do you hunt?
Dare say you can be taught.
If you hunt, you kill.
You're injured.
Still, someone must attend you. Your wife should not have let you out.
Oh.
Surely
Was there never ambition?
Then I envy yo.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
For Her Majesty.
But yourself? What about John Brown?
No other aspiration?
Ah, but therein lies the paradox. It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents. The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that? However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.
Her mind is set. She won't change now.
The threat. I tell them, but they don't see it.
Too busy looking after themselves.
No loyalty.
She'll never understand it.
She'll think I betrayed her.
You are here safely.
You are well?
And the pony?
Yes. You have a brother in service here, do you not? I forget his name.
Yes. That will be company for you.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
He thought so, yes.
Yes.
Those, over there, there.
Craobhan geanmchno... How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
I am told so.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
I do not do it for others. But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Of course I shall say what I have to say. I always do.
Ah, well...
Aye.
Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
I was told you were in a fight.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time
You stand there and tell me it is my duty... after all you promised me!
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
I will not hear any more about my safety!! You made me a promise and now you have broken it!
Because I have to!
Yes. Yes it was.
Is that not enough?
I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.
Well, both.
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense
We'll see which way the wind blows.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help. Where is the old girl?
Mrs Brown.
In the press, perhaps. But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year. Time to wheel her out.
What's her excuse this time?
I was trying to imagine " rather upset. "
A few days... When he heard, the Prince of Wales threw the bust from the window of the Royal Gallery. It took four hours to gather the fragments.
We think she can be dissuaded. Have you had a glance at the diary?
Quite. I think I'd best take it back.
Excellent, ma'am, excellent. But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
Forgive me, Your Majesty. In no way did I wish to suggest
How ill is he?
Yes, ma'am.
He appears to be... standing by his horse.
I don't know, ma'am. He was observed earlier, I believe.
Why?
Unwell?
Has he been hurt?
Why was I not told earlier?
Please make sure it does not happen again.
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
And now I am back.
Read it!
Why not?
Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?! I am not a fool. I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert. And now they attack Brown too.
I have a letter, ma'am.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
Ma'am.
You can't. He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you, you know? Like Fate. Each level you get progressively less time to complete. First half of the game takes place in the Wild Lands. Then you reach Level 6, and that's the Sea of Darkness. There's a two headed Boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right. If you don't...
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Level Ten. That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
Good question. See, that's where the fun comes in. ARCADE changes it every time. He's a machine without a soul. Once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat.
Maybe he's not dead.
The donor. Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Security camera. Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids... I know where you live.
You don't like it?
Why don't we take this into my office.
What's her problem?
Actually, no. I was just telling Nick, here, that my t. v.'s busted...
But you always lie, so you didn't come from there. That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
So take his car home. Wait. I'm sure he's up to something...
Listen to me! Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
No, in person. Now.
I'm coming over.
Turn if off!
It is.
So how did it know my name, then?
All of them?
If they're sick, great. But let's make sure. Come on, Nick.
Let's go around back.
We'll call 911. Look around Alex. We broke in, smashed the t. v., no one's going to believe what happened here!
It's not just the cable system. It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net. It's everywhere.
Maybe it is alive in a way... some sort of electronic intelligence. It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something. It's self replicating... it mimics life.
Right. And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
The Police, then...
Then where do we go?!
They made ARCADE. It's still a game, right? It thinks like a game. Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff... I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?
Get that helmet. If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible.
Yeah. The Inferno.
It can turn itself on, Alex! It doesn't need a quarter.
I know how to do this! I'm good at these games. You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
No. If you're smart, you run like hell.
I don't want anything to happen to you. I care about you.
I know. It sucks.
Don't even say it.
That's what I was hoping you'd say.
Look around...
I don't want to talk about it.
So tell me you're okay, then.
Good. Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
Sure. Never come back. Disappear forever.
Thought so.
Wait! No! That's not it!
I'm thinking!
Is it? Why don't you see for your self?
So how do I start?
Of course I can. I can say all sorts of things...
I am the Truth Teller. Where should I take you?
I am giving her a chance. Why don't you get off my back?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
They fired everyone.
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something... you've got to do something Adam!
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
What do you mean " you know "?
And?
But I'm not broke.
Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
It's been a very strange day.
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
Will you meet with him?
I'll call him, then call you back... If you want you could stay at my place.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
So why did you idiots bring me here?... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
And you'd better speak to someone too... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set up to me! And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!
Sure want to thank ya for drivin'all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
A man's attitude... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin'you agree with?
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
What did I say?
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein'such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
So let's just say I'm drivin'this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin'I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin'thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin'access to that precious film vault...
I understand.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
Okay.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called " tits and ass. "
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
I can hardly wait, Coco.
Wow!
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
Sweetie, look at me straight.
Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
Good luck, honey!
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
I think I've been hurt.
No... I need to sleep.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
Well... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
How do you remember how to talk?
No There is something... something there I can't tell... I can't describe it. There are things there.... but I'm... here.
When you think about them... the money... the key... does it make you remember anything?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
No.... I don't...
Okay.
Call the number.
Maybe... maybe... maybe.
I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.
" So... surprise "...
" But you won't... "
" Get out! Get out before I call my dad... he trusts you... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
" Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before... "
You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
Those men in front, in the car.
No... but...
No.
I know what you have to do, but let me do it.
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.
My next delivery is up that way, so I'll be getting down to it real soon.
Yeah, what for?
It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
Okay. Why this Denny's?
I had a dream about this place.
You see what I mean...
Well... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same...... they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is there's a man... in back of this place. He's the one... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream.
Right then.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin'some stuff for this guy.
Hardly.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin'to get in any trouble.
Yeah, that's a funny story.
No... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
No...
Sure.
Pick with expediency!
No one has a gun to your head.
Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.
No!
You said we were criminals, what did you mean?
Embezzling? I'm not embezzling!
I'm not fucking him..
So what do we do?
Who the hell are you anyway? What is this place?
First Bank? But how?
McCay knows?
You took an awful big risk back there.
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind?
Then he isn't embezzling either is he?
Hey! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
At the subway station, we can get into a power duct that my little shit head of an assistant doesn't know about.
Obviously, but what's the way out?
How long till the room fills?
Why did you build this whole place?
Do you have something better to talk about?
He hired you to build this place?
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account. I just knew something was wrong.
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one?
There's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
McCay had a lot money done into researching psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated, but reveal everything. Like criminal impulses, homicidal impulses.....
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing?
How can you just take a life? I mean it's a life, life is so precious. How does it feel?
I'm in charge of the conversions. When First Bank buys another smaller bank, I'm in charge of converting them to our systems and way of doing things.
I wanted to let his family know....
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it?
Great...
That was eleven years ago.
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
Yeah a real shame.
Bye....
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Just shut the fuck up.
Trust me, if you open any door, you'll be dead a whole lot sooner.
And that's different than this because......?
Why?
So what happened? Did you have a real bad theme park experience as a kid and this is your revenge?
Look pipsqueak, I'm having a real bad day here and we're just starting.
Swimming, you know, like in water, moron.
Thanks...
Where?
Don't eat at the console.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
But, he's...
When I think you're ready.
When you are ready.
Trust is earned not given away.
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
No.
You did.
He already had a balance of  600, 000.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
Any priors? Any police record?
Parking tickets? That's it?
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her?
He's been expecting you.
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob?
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides?
No. I am not a homosexual.
Have you ever considered running your own " Park "? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
We can't.
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
Aren't you the bitter one.
Bruce has just awaken.
We can't afford too many surprises.
I do believe Mr. McCray will be most pleased with the tape of this one.
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
Ach! How will you know if they've made it?
The power went out in half the park.
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
Yeah, right. He's stuck all the way over here
I meant him.
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me?
Really? On a date?
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
Dinner at my place then? Say, seven o'clock?
Thank you, won't you come in?
You have a real nice place... how can you afford this working as a temp?
I just want to have something that's mine, you know? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
Would that impress you? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
My own sit down Star Wars arcade game. Wanna play it?
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
Nothing.
No, idiot. Where do we go now?
Of course I am. I feel the testosterone coursing through my veins. Now that I've gotten the stitches removed from my arm and the chiropractor fixed my back.
Well, I think if you take several lines out of context, Star Wars becomes a very sexual movie. I mean listen to this. " Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time? " or " You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought ".
I'm going to go ahead and go now.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at? Very impressive.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now?
Were you involved in the incident where that guy killed himself in his office? I am sorry. Perhaps we should have dinner tonight to.... discuss your future.
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
No, I'm writing to the phone company because they keep charging me for calls to Caracas, Venezuela... do you know any know anybody in Caracas, Venezuela?
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
You're Vada right?
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
This is California, anything is possible.
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
Gee, that is a problem.
I don't think you're very polite.
I don't even know your name.
What about living in the real world pal?
Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
I'm sorry okay... we gotta find this guy because... he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
Well, we worked on the school paper together. I remember when the Legion of Decency declared Rebel without a Cause unfit... boy... that Jim Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor.
Everyone was really surprised when Maggie was turned in, she got kicked out for two weeks.
Pommeroy... he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup. Monday.
Could you hold on for a second?
You want me to move?
So, what's on your mind?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
I figured you did.
Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Seriously.
It's just a question, it's not about anybody.
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses... I used the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered wallpaper for your room?
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
I already bought a ticket.
I used my own money and got a great deal, it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in Dallas and stay over a Saturday.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Hi honey.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Totally.
I will. How's Shelly?
Okay... bye daddy, I love you.
Give my love to Shelly.
We have a baby?
Can I see him?
Well you should at least try a little bit.
And some taco chips so I can dunk.
Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up under the Christmas tree.
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every palm tree.
I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.
What're you saying?
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
They sure did! They got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers... these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure glad I came all the way out here to find them out.
Maggie... Maggie's little girl.
Yeah, come on, let's talk.
Oh she's great... she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and... he gave me your address and here I am.
I told you it was a long story.
Special effects?
I don't know very much about her... I was hoping that you could help me.
Do you have any pictures if her?
It's good to see Maggie again... and you.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
I'd say you turned out just fine.
Wait... woah... woah... wait a minute... Do you think I'm your father?
Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.
She didn't wanna miss out on anything... especially motherhood... it got to be a real problem with us.
That's okay.
I know that.
See you? He can smell you from there.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
Ehh... I don't know I mean....
Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
What can I do for you?
Well Enrique is great and... we are the best.
I guess you have.
Rose.
Happy hunting.
You're Alfred Beidermeyer aren't you?
Your mother?
You know I've been re reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
I'm sure she did.
But we made a business deal.
There's water in your bathroom.
Don't wake up Vada.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
You think this is easy for me? You go out on the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I don't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent if you don't do your job as a kid.
He said it was a gift.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
I got it all figured out, I know she went to Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were.
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
Vada.
Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Get married?
What, you think the guy should change his name?
Why do you argue with everything I say?
I think it's cool.
You'd rather have a mother that's a member of the police state? Rules are made to be broken. Just ask him.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Does it work?
Boyfriend?
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
Come and get it.
Just come and get it... right here!
Uh oh...
... I dropped it.
It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.
Here's Judy Garland!
That's'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws. My hands fit.
Really?
Yeah I guess... sort of.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who... accidentally had relatives that got married.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
Maybe this Jeffrey guy is... is my real father. I mean... look at me, I have the hair of a dead person and... and my nose, no one in my family has this nose, it could be the nose of... a... of a complete stranger,
Yeah?
You mean... it wasn't that terrible?
An adventure?
No?
Good bye, look in your backpack.
What's it for?
Wow!
No problem.
Phil, I think you should consider... fades as Vada walks off
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
I don't think the color of the interior is....
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
Uh huh, well... good to know. Phil hands Nick a 5 note
But... are you engaged or something?
Committed?
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
I'd like to see his house but... I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
A secret, I like that.
Well, I've come this far... the least I can do is knock on the door.
I should do this myself.
Okay.
Sounds great, well you give'em both one of these for me.
Come on... I'll show you where you're gonna stay.
He was caressing.
God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
Right now? An intimate border with... mechanical skills.
You know where the fire extinguisher is.
Wha... what do you mean? We have a date every night.
I don't want anything you don't wanna give me.
You like the way I cook... you think I make out a great invoice. PHIL You and Nick and... and this... this garage are my whole life... I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music... but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...
Well just don't shave your legs... he'll never let you visit us again if I send you home hairless and full of holes.
Yeah... right, it's pointless to worry.
I mean... with your car.
Excuse me?
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Oh, you mean you... fix the hearts... of little babies?
... so I guess I'll always... teach... you know...'cause it makes a good relief from the operating room, I feel I have an obligation...
Something wrong?
Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to... eh... to relax.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Let's just say I... eh... I'm involved.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Lizt was my parents'favorite, they were Hungarian.
I'll see you then... I look forward to it.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me  quot; Shelly Two Backs  quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
I'm definitely traveling some day.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles... next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
It would be fantastic.
You leave your father to me.
He's so tiny.
He's a great poet.
Do you know him?
He'll remember my mother for sure. STANLEY It was a big class Vada and... but... well of course he'll remember, who could forget Maggie?
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
You're such a baby.
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
Oh really, okay fine look, go cook, Gimme the goddam keys.
You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home.
Keep your voice down!
The boss is watching us...
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
Vada you've gotta stop this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you!
It's there.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
The bee stings! I can't breathe!
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the  quot; Dino Raphael  quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
They're dead?
Stiffs??
The add just said  quot; Makeup Artist  quot;
I need the job.
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
I promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks.
Yeah.
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
I just wanted to get past this  quot; old school Marm  quot; image.
Well the other night at dinner...
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Harry, I really think she.....
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Oh right, right,. Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
No kidding?
In lieu...  quot; instead  quot;.... No contest.
You have to learn how to take a complement. Movies, movies, ahhhh,  quot; Love Story  quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in. I'll let you get back to work.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Kinda like men.
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush.
No, why?
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....
This is where we are.
At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue.
Kiss me.
Good.
Goodnight Shelly.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
I'm looking forward to that.
Did you ahh, love him?
I don't know which ball's mine.
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought,  quot; if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.  quot;
I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter.
Hand me the canula.
I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing. All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle.....
Is it for a child?
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Dad??
The money?
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
She likes to play bingo.
Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company.
What are you doing.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
He's getting big. Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.
Why not?
He's okay isn't he?
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
In the garage.
What was my mama like?
Really?
Do you miss her?
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?
Why?
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened,  quot; The Sexual Revolution  quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Like a Sultenfuss. Go get'em.
No, no no....
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Sure.
Bye.
Does he love her?
Do you like her?
Why?
Really?
My Dad was funny?
That's really cool.
He won't give it to me.
Come on sweetie.
Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
I would.
What are they about?
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Sure.
Okay.
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
I think lipstick looks fake, no ones lips are that color.
No.
The boys at school don't think I am.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
See food!
Are you here to take Shelly back?
Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.
Where's Daddy?
I'm hemorrhaging.
I don't want, I don't need your help....
It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.
I think it should be outlawed.
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
Okay, get in to bed.
To chocolate?
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher.
Big deal, I can do that too. Thomas J, you got something!
Hurry!
Reel it in. He's only tiny, throw him back.
Naah, I don't wanna.
It's a mosquito bite.
If I do it, can we go?
Okay, OW!
What's wrong with your eyes?
Where's your bike?
No, I don't wanna.
You have no personality.
Never mind.
Who's that with your Dad?
Do you remember her?
What do you think it's like?
Heaven.
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.
Sorry.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
Pacifist!
Bed wetter!
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Stand back.
What do you want it for anyway?
Hurry!!!
Do it!
Sure.
Bye Ma.
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
They're getting married?
I do, she's real funny.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
You can come to my house for dinner?
Okay, seeya.
I dunno..
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Uh huh.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Here, practice on your arm like this.
Close your eyes.
Okay on the count of three.
Just, hurry.
Okay.
What?
For what?
You should look like you dressed yourself.
I'll call George's parents. Tell them I need a best man who actually looks after me.
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
... I don't send you men, anymore. You don't know what to do with them.
No, he's nothing like me. He's like you. Only straight.
I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
Same difference. If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre Teen Illinois!
When I'm talking to children.
You're butting in.
If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
Because I realized. When I see him say " I do, " that knife will be in my heart. And it will be there every...
... and having " done the right thing " will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
Sure.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Beyond reason. The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
Let's not get carried away.
Neosporin?
Ben Gay.
Manicure...
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Needing.
I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
See. Dry. It's in the delivery.
The twin part. I like to remain impartial in my contempt.
... most sentimental schmucks I pity want a honeymoon after their wedding. Just to top it off.
But he sure can kiss.
After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
... except one.
I'm not joking. I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got'em.
And the answer was so simple.
You win.
He has you on a pedestal. And me in his arms.
No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Exactly what?
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
If you're waiting for " Do you take this man? ", that's considered poor form.
Have you ever heard of. Irony?
Right. And then it didn't want to come off. Exactly.
Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey. Prob'ly with Michael, doin'the nasty.
You are  u  so right. What a nerve on that guy! Bring my dress to church, huh?
Under the circumstances. Charmed to know you, Jules.
He's said some things over the past few weeks. Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you.
You've met her parents.
I can't wait for you to meet her!
She's too genuine.
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
My very point. Here's another one...
At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!
Waiter! Check, please!
Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
... all of it. She's leaving her family, her friends, everything she knows. She's putting her career on hold, and she seems a pretty ambitious, driven, kind of pers...
You never eat when you're despondent.
Does it, really? How come you never took some sell out establishment job? You had plenty of chances!
Except for that.
That's my point!!
I'm just tired. Please put her on? Thanks.
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
Get married, apparently.
Well. How come she didn't...
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover. As they say in the sport biz.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
Lower.
Almost three.
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting. Lost. Alone. Like her life is over.
The most important thing. Is being together.
And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low paying, low status, zero respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love. How inconvenient.
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says " Mikey poo "? Or do I have to change my name to " Binky "?
... I'm partial to the tight end.
He said you told him. It'd be safer with you.
Okay, I just wanted to see if I could help out at all.
You bet.
She's fine.
Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
His Word.
That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?
I said'no! '
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Your job, huh.
Have you talked to Triplette?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
He's going to run for president.
He has that sign with the tree.
Barbara Jean.
That's what he wants.
It's on National television, Barnett.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Don't you worry. We're just having a quiet Sunday at home.
Hal Phillip Walker.
How much?
D. C.? Tammany Hall? He came there?
Yes. Percy Warner Park'.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
Let me know when you do, all right?
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
You go out in the woods and shoot targets Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven almost killed him.
Haven's not going to talk to me.
That's good, I've never seen anything so healthy.
How'd you get in here.
Didn't you get?... How are you?
Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.
Yes, sir. I need a room
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
Good night,
He is just wonderful.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L. A.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
That Tom sure is cute.
Who's that?
How do you know?
You must really like him.
I haven't gotten into politics yet. I'm still into music except for you. You're into politics.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
She had on high heels?
Need a ride?
You got a place to stay?
You in music?
Get in.
We don't mess with accessories.
What kind?
What year?
Nashville.
The car broke down.
Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
I feel really good.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
I don't know his first name.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Fungus?
I don't think so.
How do you know if they do?
Your hair fell out? Just like your father. Weak hair.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Bye.
When did you start singing?
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
Well, can you tell me why?
How long have you been with them?
And before?
Do you ever do any writing?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Do you like him?
Yes. Who's this?
Who is this?
I'm not sure. Where?
Yes.
Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville?
That's not quite what I had in mind.
I don't know who you are.
What?
Oh.
Oh?
Doesn't it have a name?
Wrong.
I know.
Car pool?
I knew when I first met you.
Thirty?
I'm twenty eight
Older than thirty?
Come on, you ever been attracted to a black guy?
I know. Goodbye.
Premeditated murder.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice... Been out three months. Are you heavy?
I'm forty six. Do you like to go up or down?
High? Do you ever get high? A walk on the wild side. Ever do dust?
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
Not me. Ain't never loved anybody. Ain't never been married. Won't either.
I see.
They said go see the chaplain.
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G string stuff for sale someplace around.
Glad to meet you.
Yes.
An album.
Where's Bill?
Where are you going?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
I mean...
No Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
Dent it a little. Boy just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
Probably a little too long.
Depends on what I'm studying.
Come on.
I'm Opal.
I'm gathering information about the characteristics of music people. I just finished a documentary on Gandi.
Why?
What? Oh. A film.
You go to school together?
Oh
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
Oh yea There has never been a better time for something new.
He is to a lot of people.
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Southern California.
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
I know a couple.
Ah... Peter Finch.
Peter Finch he's English.
Ryan O'Neal.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
Well maybe. Let's see what happens here.
It's not bad.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
Wade I've been working toward this audition for years.
You think it will?
Oh, why thank you.
I know that you are an artist and I am sure you are very religious.
What was the color of Tim's belt?
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
Jeet Kune Do... Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
Which do you recommend?
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk.
What did you think then?
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors. So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin'to your town real soon.
You got something you want to do?
By all means, knock yourself out.
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
Who is we?
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re examine them?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin'' em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
You've heard of it?
The public loves you Jack... You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
You're a celebrated cop. Twenty six years on the force, a best seller out on paperback...
You write the script Jack, call it,'Showdown in Mojave: The extermination of Mickey and Mallory', whatever... Have we found our man?
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
You're taking us to that holding cell now. All right, Cut!
Oh my God! Sorry.
Anything.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Look, I'll trade you.
Do you have a back up.
Even better. Wayne call your station, tell'em we're going live a little early today. Make it happen!
Wagons, hooaaa!
Yes.
Yours.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
What I'd like to do
Manson beat you.
We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. And that time has definitely come. I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin'window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying,'So what?'I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
Not to anybody. She sings.
Songs.'He's A Rebel','Leader Of The Pack','Town Without Pity', that Dusty Springfield song'I Only Want To Be With You'. That's what I hear anyway. Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors'report used against you. So even if she would see me, which she won't, I couldn't put her on camera anyway. If I ask her,'Mallory, are you insane?'And she starts singing'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road', that blows our whole case.
Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
What I did for fun for starters. Well, something I used to do... always was a lot of fun... No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Was what worth it?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
Tell me about the purity.
Okay... okay... I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
Describe Mallory.
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory. What's up here? What's in here?
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Says the United States of America.
Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date.
Scott's dead. And unless you wanna play follow the leader, shut up and do as you're told.
Where's it parked?
Let me have the keys.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
We'll all be killed.
' Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.'Have you won any awards?
' Respected journalist'On your knees...
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead... Way Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta
Yes.
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
And they made the first move?
And a snake eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Only on a much grander scale.
Schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says,'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun. '
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Here.
Take a wild stab!
The entire wing?
Jesus...
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Roger, no.
Roger, do you understand what the word'no'means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin'donut shit, and gather your gear.
Scotty?
And where do you keep Mickey?
Who?
Wayne Gayle!
Two thirty. Shhh...
I assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along.
Waitin'in the lounge.
Coolin'her jets in a holding cell.
I'm taking one of these men. Yates, come with me.
Are you kidding? The last thing they expected was Mickey Knox to get up close and personal. They wanted a follow up episode and would've taken anything I had given them. I'm not gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it. When I told Woody and the brass about this coup, they practically shit a brick. I'm talkin'an adobe brick. They want to expand the show to a hour, and they want it on immediately.
Tomorrow.
They passed the'edge'along to us.
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Never is a very long time, Wayne. A word only the weak use. I'm not a sore loser. Even if I don't have a leg to stand on, I'm going to get up and fight this world until I'm on top again.
I'm the superintendent here at L. A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
By all means.
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need. After working together these past coupla years, we're like well oiled machinery. No, more like a Formula race car. No, scratch that one, too. What we're really like is a Swiss watch. Small, intricate, compact... it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does. Because of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and the artist's loving hand.
Ya know, I was.
I was on the'Dukes of Hazzard'set about eight years ago.
Oh, that'Dukes of Hazzard'show, there was probably ninety five people there, maybe more.
It sure is.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
Two guys?
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
Three.
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get'em outta here.
Yeah.
They done that too long in my family.
Want me to come?
Come on, honey.
It sure is.
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
What d'you say, Duff?
Hell, you got steady work.
Goddamnit, nigger you must think you're white! Who d'you think you are king of Harlem?
Who're you tellin'to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin'done'round here!
So it wasn't funny, huh? Well, I thought it was. What d'you say, Barney? Wasn't it funny?!
Walker and Williams.
Anderson.
' Bout time you showed. Door's open.
She done moved to Detroit.
She got herself a husband now. They don'want him'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
I don't know. He's your boy.
Make sure he gets those shots.
People seen him'round.
I don't know.
How'you doing?
Looks like you're doin'a good job.
Don't say much, do you?
Just so you do your work.
Cup of coffee. I'been meanin'to talk to you.
You know, over at the mill, there's just one guy that talked. It's kinda late to say it, but we shoulda acted different.
It's just that we're not used to seein'anyone stand up'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Okay, I will.
I'll have me some of that punch there, too.
You working?
I'm a teacher.
In Birmingham.
Your folks live there?
Yes, aren't you?
My father's the preacher.
That's right.
Maybe.
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin'or something?
So what you doin'with a cat like me in a joint like this?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
How about another beer?
Go on you can have one!
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
How d'you mean?
I see. That beer made me dizzy.
That's why you come back, huh?
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no good town.
Scared, huh?
But I would like to see you again.
What d'you mean?
I wouldn't have let you.
No, on the porch.
What?
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Look, Duff most of the men I know they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
Good night, Duff.
I don't know.'Guess I belong here more than there.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Well, it ain't that good up there neither. Might as well make it here.'Course I ain't really makin'it now.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I'been thinkin'.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin'to Birmingham.
Goin'to see my kid.
Yeah. Well, I do.
No, I ain't married. Well, good bye.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
That's right.
Come here, Duff. No point running away from coincidence.
What's he like?
Your boy.
I'll have some coffee, please.
What happened, Duff?
Don't push me, Duff.
What about that girl?
No. But a small one.
It's okay with me, baby. But how'you goin'to like it?
That's all right with me. Always liked kids.
Let's just see how the two of us make out first, huh?
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Hmmm good coffee.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Well, if you don't know I can't tell you.
My kids want me to teach them.
Go on hit me!
Don't look so scared.
Well, I haven't come around.
How come you keep askin'?
Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm not really thinkin'about it. Anyway, don't want those white guys laughin'up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out.
About ten dollars.
You can have what I've got. It's right there.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
Day work.
Stop bein'so damn understandin'.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Like hell they can't. They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
Jesus, baby, you're so full of talk! Well, you ain't never really been a nigger, have you livin'like that in your father's house! So just shut your mouth.
Nothin. Quit lookin'at me like that!
Well, that'll be the first time.
I don't think that'll happen.
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
Like I said, baby I'll write you.
What's so hot'round town?
I bet she's easy jam.
Like a home, for one thing.
Well, it's better than windin'up like a bum.
I wasn't thinkin'about you, Frankie.
I guess you'll be making'some changes'round here.
Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.
I'm Duff.
Wouldn't have known you.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Yeah. That's right.
No.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin'' round.
Pretty good for a one armed nigger, huh?
What d'you want anyhow? What you come and bother me for?
Beat it!
Didn't I tell you to beat it huh?
Just tryin'to be helpful.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
What did you say, boy?!
I heard you! Now'stead of bein'smart, you just get that car out of here!
How often is that?
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Well, what're you going to do?
Going back, huh?
They'll run you out.
How'you gonna live?
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
Don't be too hard on him.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Good bye, Duff.
Hell, they're all after the same thing.
What're you gonna get out of it, huh?
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Well, I got married to one of them.
Sure. Got a sixteen year old girl.
He's my son!
No. Why?
Let's stay here, Will.
Shut up, Will.
You're breaking my heart. Got to see a man about a dog.
Like hell you ain't!
Better now. Where'you at?
Sometimes. And sometimes I don't Shut the fuck up!
Omar
She's coming, Omar, she's coming
No more goddamn talking! I want the bitch or I'm gonna do the girl!
Enough talking! We been talking for eleven fucking hours, man. My throat's fucking raw!
Nathan to HBT 1. Negotiator is requesting more time.
Since you got married. You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target. You'll get yourself killed. Just keep talking.
Negotiator entering Kill Zone.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
Then we would have talked, you and I.
Don't play with me.
Pity. Then you'll both have to die.
What about her?
If there's a Babylon, man, that's it. We leave her in there, she ain't comin'out, steppin'razor or not.
Excellent, but that's where Peter come in. 3Jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. Peter will simply escort Molly to the villa. Once she's in... Case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode.
You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
What?
Very well.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
Sense / Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies. Terms?
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
Good, because you've got a new one.
Right. And no one would take on an A. I.... If they had a choice.
Anything rated higher than a P. C.'s got a hard wired suicide switch. It'll self destruct.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A. I. flatlined him.
What are you talking about?
And then?
It's just that sometimes I wonder what team I'm playin'on.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
Did you trace it?
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
Linked?
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite.
As long as you cooperate. I want it now, Armitage.
The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
Always... By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Help me send this Wintermute motherfucker straight down into it.
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
Maybe so...
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing. Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos. Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
Who got you into this?
Never heard of him.
What about the A. I., Dix? Sense / Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
What?
That A. I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
You cruise A. I.'s, you end up on tape.
Bright enough to be dangerous.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A. I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
I'm workin'on it, Bro. I'm workin'on it.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin'from a mile away.
What are you talkin'about?
Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
How much time you got left?
Meet me back here in twenty five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
You haven't got it?
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
Case. Make yourselves comfortable. Anyone like a taste?
The angels... I think they're calling your name.
Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
Where did you here that?
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
What about before that?
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
Maybe something's onto him.
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
Go ahead...
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
On a good run... yeah.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
It sounds like you.
Shhh...
Yeah.
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
So... did you get a look at heaven?
Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
For Peter, that's a short trip.
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
No we don't...
Laser fail safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
Who?
Like what?
How are you at riddles, Peter?
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole as in " head of cattle ", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like " I could eat a horse. "
Why do they listen to Guy?
Sure. No problem.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
NASA. Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection ", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
Aldys, don't miss your prom it only happens once.
I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?
It is?
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
I'm late for lab.
Oh. I forgot.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
No Roger from op / ed?
You're Pam?
Right. Right.
Who told!
Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
You stood for like a month.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Anita!
When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
Okay. That's bad.
Mama mia. Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
So I was thinking about what you were saying y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
Bridgework?
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!
You need my help?
Wings?
I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
You crossed over.
By Guy?
Eh.
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's good.
You've done five of my ideas.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A flack jacket.
You don't think I can grab bulls'balls?
Hey I can be out of control.
Geller, this is way out of your league.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf
Uhh, no.
Well, how would you define to parties "? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session
OUT!
What if I say no?
It's got it all sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system
And that's the best part. " Teacher Student Relations: How close is too close? " We're gonna blow the lid off it!
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.
Cool. I'll catch you later.
My sword.
You said that already.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
Okaaaay.... That car's going to bankrupt you.
Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
Better person than I.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and
This this is a luau that sells packing material!
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
It was a long time ago
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
Good.
Why is that impossible?
Rob. Please focus.
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
Little known fact.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
That's the spirit!
You're twenty three years old!
Hear one. Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Duh. Tom Cruise. " Risky Business ".
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.
I love the way she writes.
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Sure, why?
Well, I'm definitely seventeen and now definitely late
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
So what are you thinking for college?
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
Josie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell You actually feel the words in here. They're alive. Like Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon "? How for her it was like a Concord grape. " That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin "
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
Of course. I remember everything from your class.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
You have to say that. You're my student.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
I don't know. And you know what's scary when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me. You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
I'm thinking when I'm home.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.
Yeah, actually I do.
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
Told him if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story.
No, I'm alone.
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?! I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
You set me up. For a story. You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No the problem was she didn't even exist!
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
I don't know.
That's what I'm saying.
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
Duh.
No, I know. But, what if you don't make it?'I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, " hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post "?! Totally lame.
Three of a kind...
We've only been living here six weeks now. I want that room unpacked by tonight.
Don't be a smart ass.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
No. Upstairs.
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
You know what I'm talking about. What did you use, a fire cracker? A cherry bomb?
Alright then, what is it? Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
What is it then? There's got to be an explanation. Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
I don't know! I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him.
There is no Jesse. I'm Jesse now.
He'll die with me!
Get outa here.
You two got a thing going, or what?
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
Naw. Just killing time.
They've only been trying to unload that dump for five years. That place is bad news. Some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy. She watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street. Her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door.
Who told you to choke up that way?
No shit.
Schneider's always got a stick up his ass.
What are you doing here?
Are you nuts or something?
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor. And you want to sleep with me. Go figure.
I believe you. You had some scary dreams, okay?
Ah, nothing.
Let me look at your eye...
You mean a shithead.
Fred Krueger. The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her. Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.
You don't have to. You just have to believe in energy.
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
Make a left at this corner.
It's a surprise.
I thought you might be able to make a connection.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
About not finding any bogey men?
Now, there's an idea we can take off on. Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and... Until I fall asleep.
What is it?
You didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here. You had another nightmare, didn't you?
You want to talk about it?
I wish you'd talk to me. We can figure it out, you know. We can figure it out together.
Will you leave me alone? Please.
Who? Who's doing this to you?
Eggs?
Making friends?
Fine.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks. Any cute guys gonna be there?
Yor dad picking the music again?
Did she always have nightmares?
I'm serious.
Just some answers. There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen. All good kids, smark kids.
I'm sure you would.
I'll need to take her things.
I'll get it. Please, I don't mind.
Don't " hi Mom " me. What are you still doing up? It's past one!
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep. C'mon, angel.
Kristen, don't start with me. You know what your shrink said...
I am not going to let you get me into an argument, goddamn it. Not tonight. Now get in bed.
What are you still doing up? It's past one.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep. C'mon, angel.
Please Mom? I just don't want to be alone.
How's your hand?
I've been good. When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Oh, right. You're gonna be a TV star.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
Jennifer
He wears a dirty brown hat. He's horribly burned. He has razors on his right hand.
The city that never sleeps. So what will you do now?
To old friends. And your new dreams.
Yes. I'm going to see her tonight.
When I was still a kid. My folks got divorced. After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing. I guess I didn't.
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
That was different.
Let's try this way.
Pulled night duty. Trimble's sick.
So... got the keys to heaven, baby.
The dispensary. I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high. A night at Club meth.
Oh yeah? Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
I'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow. The patient's rooms are down here.
Restless. Very restless.
Don't hold back on us, Max. We need all the help we can get.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory. She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock  roll.
Yeah, but here you are. How'd I get so lucky? I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
People are still dying. After all this time. Stop running away from it. Daddy, please... don't make me beg. You owe me.
But nightmares are the common thread?
Anything?
Oh God.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
Call it a passion. I've got to get going.
Only if you call me Neil. What was that nursery rhyme all about?
Well, we've got
Must have opened while I was away at school.
My mother's dead. Died in her sleep.
My father an I... well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
It was. Neil, do you believe in other realities?
I'm serious.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
That's what I know.
All right. Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
That's right.
Just until we get things under control.
I used to be like them, Neil. I know what they're going through.
Do you? You told me they're survivors... and they are. But how much longer they survive is up to us.
We're gonna try.
C'mon. Let's get out of this rain.
Then maybe you're ready.
The truth.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
Bullshit. Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good. Besides, we do have a choice.
I've heard crazier things this week.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
Who would know where they were hidden?
Hey, everybody has bad dreams.
We can't get to her. I've tried.
The by product of guilt. Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
That's precisely what they need. Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
They used to keep a spare key.
You're about to attend a funeral. One that's long overdue.
Listen.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort. I've seen you before. Sister...?
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
I beg your pardon?
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it? Some kind of scandal...
My God.
Freddy.
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
She's been doing ground breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Nothing. They're my patients. It's my decision. I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
I'll go straight to Carver if I have to. He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
Of course.
Doesn't count. You gotta say the words.
C'mon.
Good. You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog. What do you do?
Oh God.
Well... a shot at it.
You're right. I told you I was bad at acting.
Oh, stop showing off.
No, but seriously it's not fair so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women and still be beg bottomed.
And then I... right.
Oh... no one... no one. Just some... guy from the past. I don't know what he's doing here. Bit of an awkward situation.
Splendid. I'm actually in the stock market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff P. G. Wodehouse, you know farce, all that.'Ooh careful there, vicar.'Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
I see friends from university clever chaps been in the business longer than you they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life. What sort of acting do you do?
Oh splendid. Well done. How's the pay in movies? I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Right. Right. So that's... fairly good. On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
Yes. This one though is... very good.
Yes, we couldn't stop him. If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
I also have a phone. I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non prostitute sense obviously.
Coffee?
Orange juice probably not.
Would you like something to nibble apricots, soaked in honey quite why, no one knows because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless there we go yours if you want them.
Do you always say'no'to everything?
Oh right.
Bye.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life. Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Right. Great. Classic. Classic.
I brought these, but clearly...
Obviously. Very difficult.
Absolutely fine about it.
Okay fine.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
If that's all right.
Okay.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
And the pregnancy thing is that to do with the accident?
Busy tomorrow?
I was.
Ah no that's the point they're private villages only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
Ahm...
Nothing.
No, I didn't.
Exactly. Here we go again.
Why?
Uh oh. That's not good.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I don't know either.
There are lots of reasons. Do you want to come up?
Why?
Your boyfriend?
I think goodbye is traditional.
Thank you. I'm just in London for two days but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
A bath would be great.
I don't know. It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him. And you... and love?
I have thought about you.
Yes start in L. A. on Tuesday.
Would you? It's all talk, talk, talk.
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
' Very well, captain I'll pass that on straightaway. '
Eleven.
Cartwright.
' Certainly. And little Johnny? '
Yup.
Brilliant. Word perfect I'd say.
Gripping. It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know this writer's pretty damn good too.
And I think the book is the poorer for it.
With a goat playing a violin.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
Big feet large shoes.
Definitely.'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks but neither cheek. In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation. '
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Definitely. Ths is important stuff.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he? It's delicious.
Both.
Right.
No! No. Wait. I... thought you were someone else. I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
Oh God yes I'm sorry.
Well...
More than that actually, when you think about it. You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Actually, I can't think really let me just have a quick look...
Her most famous part men went to bed with the dream and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality do you feel that way with me?
Oh.
Damn, I forgot the jam.
Jesus.
I don't know what happened.
You can stay calm it's the perfect situation for you minimum input, maximum publicity. Everyone you ever bump into will know.'Well done you you slept with that actress we've seen the pictures. '
Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
Excuse me?
You really don't get it. This story gets filed. Every time anyone writes anything about me they'll dig up these photos. Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
But... wait... there are things to say.
Drink tea there's lots of tea.
You disappeared.
Well... how have you been?
Oh no. It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was but nonsense it all is... Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off but I brought you this from home, and...
No, don't open it yet I'll be embarrassed.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice. So it's been just sitting in the hotel. But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is...
The truth is...
I live in Notting Hill. You live in Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world knows who you are. My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Well, don't over do it. I don't want people saying,'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend. "
Can I have your autograph?
Rufus.
Nice one. Would you like my phone number?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
Oh dear. He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Does the girl have a name?
Christ, what is going on in there?
Crazy. Go along Bayswater...
Yes.
Yup.
No!
Don't even ask.
I never fancied you much actually...
Do you want to stay?
That's nice.
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in. I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.
Where's Bella?
Of course it is. Any favourite among the 22?
Da Vinci?
Of course. And is he your favourite Italian film director?
Yes. What do you think?
You daft prick!
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her. You think about her all the time now you can ring her!
It is great, isn't it. See you tonight. Hey, Marty sexy cardy.
Well, yes usually I'd just changed to go home but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
I'll see what I can do.
Absolutely. Ice cold still water.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Right.
Ahm... Bernie.
Mr. Thacker's from'Horse and Hound. '
Have you got a moment?
Well, fire away.
I did.
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
Yes, better get me a half. All I can afford.
Who? Someone famous?
That's right Topol.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
I suppose so.
Not classic, no.
But it's not for the shop. It's for you.
I actually tried that tack but she said you said that before and it's been twenty four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
' No comment'means'yes. '
Do you ever masturbate?
You see it means'yes. '
Buggered?
Really?
No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.
There's an understatement. There are dead people on better form.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation. I'm a friend of Anna Scott's and she rang me at home the day before yesterday and left a message saying she's staying with you...
No, that's right I know that. She said she's using another name but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
No, sir.
Does she know you're coming?
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
... can't let you through.
That's right I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t shirt.
Well... wait for it... First there's this one...
Wouldn't want that... Okay just one more.
Good luck.
Well, there you go. On for a video fest tonight? I've got some absolute classic.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Groovy. You should do more of this stuff.
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
You want me to write down all your messages?
Right. No one else?
Which was?
I think she said her name was'Flintstone. '
Bollocks. This happens every time I go to the cinema. Average day, my glasses are everywhere everywhere I look, glasses. But the moment I need them they disappear. It's one of life's real cruelties.
Oh shit, is that the time? I have to go.
Sort of.
She's someone I just can't someone who... self evidently can't be mine and it's as if I've taken love heroin and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box. And there's trouble inside.
Maybe.
Yes.
Yes.
Spike. For God's sake she's in trouble get a grip.
Spike!
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Just take my work for it.
Right.
No. You can't bin these. They're classics. I'm not allowing this.
Let me help. We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
Oh. Right.
Wait a minute she took your grandmother's flowers?
Bad news.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
The one down your trousers.
Right well, then we have something of an impasse. I tell you what I'll call the police and, what can I say? If I'm wrong about the whole book down the trousers scenario, I really apologize.
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it. See you in a sec.
He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife,'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.'So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
But you have no proof.
And yet you suspect her.
Why?
Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
N n n n n no, ma'am.
Tell us about it...
Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
N n n n no, no, I du du du didn't, I didn't!
Sh sh sh she m m made m m me do it!
Sh sh she did! Everybody did!
M M Muh Muh McMurphy!
Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.
Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.
Yes, ma'am. Lead the way, Sam.
Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start? Billy.
How'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
On this ward?
Oh, I had them removed.
Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day.
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
' Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an'what I want is to take a vote on switchin'the group meetin'to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
Yeah?
The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
I'm proposing a re vote on watchin'the ballgame!
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
So do I!
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch...
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Welcome back.
I hope everything is settled.
Thank you, ma'am...
Thank you, ma'am.
Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin'' bout showin'your hand.
Well, put'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy.
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play.'Kay!
So long, kid.
Shhh...
Fuck Miss Ratched!
Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we take ourselves a little spin around the place.
Yeah, kid?
Marry who?
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
It's okay, kid. Everything it going to be okay... I'll come back an'getcha in a while...'Kay...
Goddammit, you sly son of a bitch! Does anybody else know?
Shit! This is too much! Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an'make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit'em.
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Yeah, well, well, well.'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin'down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin'you and beating you to the floor...
Shhh, Chief, don't talk. Never talk! Remember, this is just between you an'me. Do ya understand?
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Whaddaya talkin'about? There's at least twenty guys in there. Let's wake'em up and get this party on the road.
Lend me twenty.
Come here!
Sure, Mack...
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Shhh...
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?
Did to me?
And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
Lobotomy!
That!
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet face if ya paid me!
It is to me! An'if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will!
You're fuckin'A right, I am!
You heard me the first time!
Okay, sucker.
So why are you talking to him?
It doesn't help him.
I'm busting outta this place.
I was open! Come on, let's play ball!
I said out!
I'm the coach!
You can come back later!
Scanlon out!
Let me see your hand!
Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some pressing matters to attend to.
Why not?
Hear what?
When?
Who told you that?
Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...
That's a dime, Martini.
That's twenty up, Martini. Hey, Taber, who's pitching the opening game?
Bye bye.
I'm hungry.
He is!
Oh, do you do much fishing?
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Poker!
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin'feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin'I done time in so many small time jails I could write a brochure...
Well, ya know, Doc... Doesn't it say so there?
I don't, Doc...
That's correct, Doc...
Doc, what can I tell ya?
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
You bet, Doc!
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Yes, that may be so, but in making a careful study of your past record, along with your behavior since you arrived here, my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to Pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case.
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
When?
Replacement coming in! Harding out!
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin'up. Kay?
' Kay, let's see... Cheswick first... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an'the Chief...'Kay
Shhh!
No,'fraid not...
You look pretty healthy to me.
How do ya know that?
You're breathin'right now.
All right!
Shhhh. Time to say goodbye.
Yeah!
Ten bucks.
That right?
Shhhh. See ya around the ball park.
Well, you boys finish it up an'climb back into your beds.'Kay?
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
Ah'm on my knees, brother, ah'm on my knees.
Yeah...
He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an'dumb indian...
Are you a doctor?
Potential assaultive.
Boogered!
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
That me an'my buddy, Cheswick, we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin'the ballgame while you suckers are sittin'around this goddamn nursery!
What?
Oh, that. That ain't nothin'to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies. These are nice guys. Nice guys.
Is he in an asylum?
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
Well, I'm running a risk by letting you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin'a risk of gettin'my black ass fired. If you understand what I mean...
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
Oh, I'm all through talkin'. Now, let's just you an'me trip on down that hall.
Si.
Your mother.
Your grandmother?
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
Okay, ma'am, just a moment.
He couldn't have checked out I was supposed to meet him here.
Because.
What's she doing?
So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
Seriously.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
Let's face it. Sooner or later we all die.
What great aunt?
No.
My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
I'm engaged. I'm supposed to be married in two days.
Dwayne Pinsley. From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
Sa dov'e'lui?
Ha un numero di telefono?
A restaurant. In Piazza Navona.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is. I know where to find him.
Please, Larry. I have to hurry.
What?...
Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
My picture's up?
So, this is what you do? I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Smoking or non smoking?
Beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing. Nobody's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it. But, I don't know. An awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks.
He's not in at the moment. Can I take a message?
This is his fiancee. Who's this?
I can hardly hear you. Could you spell that?
Uh in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Venice? I love Venice. With the boats, right?...
That was before I found out what it was.
Oh, come on... What kind of an excuse is that?
Are you okay? You want some help?
You are leaving, aren't you?
Yes?! To be married, I suppose.
To the foot doctor.
So?! Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
Why are you asking me this?
He's a podiatrist. Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong. Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
So?
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
It's in the south. I've still got my rental car. I can get you there by morning...
Look, I know there's no going back for us. That's not it. I just want to make this up to you. Clear my relationship karma. And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there. Please. Let me do this for you. Let this be my gift to you.
I'd really rather not say.
Mickey Spillane.
Or Hustler.
Oh, and I forgot to tell you. He's here with his mother.
Yeah.
Anyway, that's why I came by. I need to fix this button. Do you have a needle and thread?
Nice dress.
We were hungry.
So were you.
I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
No. Are you're leaving?
Yeah... Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
No. I mean yes, I'm not. I decided to call it off. Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Thank you. So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime. I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
Okay. I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
There's no such thing.
Reptilian swine. There's no such thing. Reptiles aren't swine.
I don't know what you're talking about. Who told you that?
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
I sabotaged it? You're the one who lost him, remember?
As I recall, you were on your way home. And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
What would you call it?
Yes. I'm crazy. You have driven me crazy. No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you. Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up? How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Very funny.
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
Sure is.
I just got here, too. Not yesterday. But, just now. Today. Just a few minutes ago. Yeah, we just got here... I mean, I just got here. I'm single.
Any night.
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
Really...
Don't worry about it. You're my guest.
You like shrimp? I like shrimp.
Mommy, this is Faith.
Let's face it. You want me.
How about the other one? His friend.
How about that guy at the bank?
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
But somebody wrote those songs.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
No.
I don't know. I don't think so.
So, he's not my type. Let me walk you to the elevator.
You don't have any idea?
Why don't you ask him?
If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
That's the problem. When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies. Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap. Turn.
People have problems, insecurities, flaws and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive. It's not settling, Faith, it's life. Real life.
Is that bad?...
After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think
The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence.
It's still the new year...
I have vacation time coming to me.
That's where you're wrong. I got one nine years ago. I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Would you stop saying that? I need you to do me a really big favor.
Of course not. I told him I was going to visit a great aunt. And don't tell Larry, either.
He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying.
Live happily ever after.
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
I don't know... Maybe. Think of it as an adventure.
" Of the Rich and Famous ". Of which we are neither. Are you out of your mind? We can't afford this.
Yes. Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
We lost him?...
I don't think he understood what you were saying. What's the airport number?
So?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
Oh. Right.
A phone message. Only
Only, it's in Italian...
Right. So we should've been able to cover more of them.
What's that supposed to mean?...
Sorry.
You think he misses me at all?
You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to? But maybe I was wrong. Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
Polo.
Right. My brother.
What's she saying?
I never even got to be single.
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us. He's wearing a navy jacket. If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Nope.
Right. Okay... It's meant to be right? This is it.
Good luck.
And then what, Faith?
I think it's time we got some professional help.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Men have ways.
Sightseeing... What're you doing?
Why?
So, you've had a little bad luck.
Okay, a lot of bad luck. But that means the odds are probably in your favor now. This is no time to give up.
It was a ouija board, remember?
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be. I've got forty eight hours. I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
Peter? Peter was a mistake. An imposter.
Who said I was going?
I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
I'm sure. And Kate, thank you for coming. Thank you for being such a good friend.
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
Faith, I'm kidding. Is this how you plan to get what you want from life? When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
And he is living proof.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
Oh.
What about Larry?
Larry, did you rent a car?
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
This is your most lucky day. My family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
A porco?
Oh, hello. I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but
You see, in America they care for work, they live to work. But in Italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure...
But I do want to.
Huh?
Uh, yeah. Sure. Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Sociologist. And because. Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners. They're all for sale, but none of'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
Don't call me doll, Larry. I hate it when you call me doll.
You said it differently then.
It was just a joke. I was pushing the arrow. I wanted to get to the next question. I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
He existed. He was some kid I knew from Little League. He was a real jerk. You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
And you didn't tell her?
Where is she?
No! That's not fair. That's not it at all. Look, something somewhere got screwed up. Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed. I may not have the right name, but I was there. I'm the guy. I'm skywriting??
Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome? My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles. The measles. Who gets the measles at forty three? So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either. I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out. So I was wandering around. Just wandering... When I got hit in the head with this shoe.
Whatever. And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever. And He did. She told me the name. Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
Sorry...
I'm gonna take her home first.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth 
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
Well, where are they?
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
That's all. Next witness!
Listen kid, I'm a soft tough too. Ask any rummy on the dock if I'm not good for a fin any time they put the arm on me. But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin'watchman's pension. When I was sixteen I had to beg for work in the hold. I didn't work my way up out of there for nuthin'.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
It'll do.
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for. Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the  er  as you put it  main order of business?
I wish I knew.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
But my own kid bro 
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
Let me explain you something, kid. Stooling is when you rat on your friends, on the guys you're with. When Johnny needs a favor, don't try to figure it out, just do it. Now go ahead, join the congregation.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
That's right....
Mm  hmm.
Mm  hmmm.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three four hundred a week just for openers.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against 
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals  you know what they're worth to us?
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber lipped 
 ex tanker who's walking on his heels ?
What the hell!!!
The point is  there isn't much time, kid.
Four thirty seven  that isn't where Gerry G...?
I wish I didn't have to do this, Terry.
... eight seven, eighty eight. What's it to you?
It wasn't him! It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, " Kid, this ain't your night  we're going for the price on Wilson. " It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready  remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens  This bum Wilson he gets the title shot  outdoors in the ballpark!  and what do I get  a couple of bucks and a one way ticket to Palookaville. It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short end money.
See! You don't understand!
You don't understand! I could've been a contender. I could've had class and been somebody. Real class. Instead of a bum, let's face it, which is what I am. It was you, Charley.
What makes him so special?
Things're lookin'up on the docks, huh, Jackie?
They play pretty rough.
I'm with Terry.
I better see you get there.
What did that man mean when he said you were....?
I better get home.
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
I want to be a teacher.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
In braids? That's right.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
I can get home all right from here 
The moment I saw you.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.
What?
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd  get into bad company.
That's my own flock up there, getting their evening workout. I won plenty of races with'em. Listen, you want to see them? Come up on the roof with me and I'll show'em to you.
Thanks anyway.
What for?
I really don't know.
He had a few birds. I got up and fed'em this morning.
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
How do you like that one?
One thing about them though, they're faithful. They get married just like people.
Want to go out and have one with me?
Come on, I know a quiet one, with a special entrance for ladies....
It's quite   nice.
No thanks....
A dive? You mean, into the water?
What made you want to be a fighter?
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Terry!
Our Lord said just the opposite.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or  or human kindness in your whole body.
And when things get in your way  or people  you just knock them aside  get rid of Them  is that your idea?
Why, Terry, who said it was?
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
His  racket?
But a priest...?
And if you don't?
But that's living like an animal 
You haven't finished your beer.
I got my whole life to drink.
For  not being any help?
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin'to me when you get burned.
Because... because... Listen Edie, don't get sore now  but I think we're getting in love with each other.
That goes double for me.
It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?
Don't say that, Edie, don't...
Much more, Terry. Much, much more!
I don't rate it.
I've been sittin'in the church.
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me  he says it's up to me.
The Father. The Father.
Told him what?
You....
Don't tell me  don't tell me!
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
I don't want to hurt Charley  I don't want to hurt you...
I know what you want me to do!
That   word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience....
I keep hearing it and I don't know what to do.. I don't know what to do....
Edie...
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Edie, Edie, I...
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Terry, for God's sake.
No, I can't let you. I can't, you're 
Thanks just the same.
But I feel like  My friends won't talk to me.
My pigeons....
Every one of'em....
Farm...
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm in arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin'in and feelin'sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you had  the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian....
Six toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin'with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
See this arm? It's two inches longer'n the other one. That's years of workin'and sweatin', liftin'and swingin'a hook. And every time I heisted a box or a coffee bag I says to myself  this is for Edie, so she can be a teacher or somethin'decent. I promised your mother. You better not let her down.
Pop!
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
Our identification.
I don't know nothing.
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
I think you could have.
You sure looked it. Something go wrong?
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and 
Yeah. My own blood  and they sell me out for a lousy bet  I had it in me to hit the top and  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys 
Really?
I ought to belt you one, J. P.
.... and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
My ain't we touchy this morning?
Boy, you must've been up early.
He's got his nerve, gum shoeing around here after what you told him.
A cheese eater! You're kidding!
You was a Golden Warrior.
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
No?
Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.
Listen, kid, why don't you go home before Johnny....
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
I'll see you on the roof.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Hey, Terry, front and center.
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
It's good for you. Develops your mind.
My favorite little cousin.
OK  skip it, Einstein. How come you never got no education like the rest of us?
Go on  a little present from your Uncle Johnny. And Mac, tomorra mornin'when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day. Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O. K.?
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
He don't, huh? Well, he knows thirty nine pages worth of our operation.
I got it. Hot off the press.
Go on  beat it. Don't push your luck.
I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin'about it.
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap  conniving  good for nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done  you hear me?  glad what I done!
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin'on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin'punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'....
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Thanks for nothing, you bum.
One little dime you don't need. I know you  you're Edie Doyle. Your Brother's a saint   only one ever tried to get me my compensation.
Look who says bum!
I wonder how many Hail Marys the Father'll make me say at confession. It'll be worth it! The pallet is loaded now. Terry turns and approaches Nolan.
You don't think he'd be  helpful?
Maybe I will  one of these days.
Nolan....
If I could get my hands on you...
Leave her alone, I tell you!
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
But horror stories! Why all the time horror stories?
Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
There's an old cemetery on this road. I've been there before.
In there.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
Something's making that music.
All right. Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
Not dead? In a cemetery?
Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find. They'll have a telephone. C'mon.
Can't we get out of here?
What do you mean?
Those creatures..!
What can we do?
Whatever you do, don't do that.
I am It's our only chance.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
You do?
You're talking nonsense.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave or would they?
That sudden?
... And I thought you loved me.
I don't know, yet. We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do I hope I'll know what to do.
All right. Put it on heavy.
Him! I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
You love me then?
Live ones where only the dead should be?
We don't know of anything, Master...
It's not often an Emperor like you calls on creatures like us.
Aaaahhhh.
Yes, sir, Master.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
You know that Super Bowl party? They changed the date. It's on tonight, eight thirty.
I said not as a rule.
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth. Out there in the free world.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight thirty, like only a few hours from now. So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
What're you talking about?
Glenn Michaels.
He did, huh. Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on'em. I might not even take'em off first.
Uh sorry. Wrong number.
Yes.
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you? About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.
Why not?
But you spoke to him on the phone.
He called the day he escaped.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Did you know that when you married him?
That wasn't Jack's fault. No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job before they'd done it instead of after. She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc. I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Okay, honey, come on out of there.
His idea? Gimme a break. Fuckin'guy's got a vacant lot for a head. Was you and me figured the whole thing out.
You're too late, Jack.
Oh, man.
I know exactly what you mean. It's just a feeling. You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Sounds great.
Maybe this'll make you feel better.
Just that she got away.
You'll have to ask Glenn. And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades. He does, he's gonna try to find me. Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
So call her up. Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
You at least bring the gun?
Let's go to Detroit.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
Snoopy. Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
Or two.
She came up here on her vacation,'cause she likes shitty weather.
You tell your sister about it?
How long you talk to her?
How long were you with the girl?
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look. Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
No doubt the man's got some big ass security system.
Yeah? You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle bound asshole with us?
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin'the good life.
What about that D. B. Cooper guy?
My sister believes in fate, but not hell. That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up. Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
You might not have a choice.
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U. S. Marshal?
Did you give her a jump? If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
You find out?
But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
Stay with the maid. I'm gonna have a look around.
Yeah, hi. Nice house.
What?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
At least.
Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about to go down, you'll be on the phone with your sister for a month. Let me do this part alone.
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
You talked to him?
What'd you talk about?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks. You recall that?
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you. So you had to at least suspect him.
The time came, you shot him. But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him. They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand. You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down. But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
I have to qualify, is that it?
Sounds to me like he liked having you around. I'll see you, Karen. Mr. Sisco.
Daniel. Listen
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Yeah, I know. I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
All right, but...
Sure, Daniel.
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
Yes or no, Daniel. If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
That's all I wanted to know.
Yeah, why?
You can go wait out in the car, you want to.
And you let them come up. You don't try to make the bust yourself. You understand?
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest. Put the gun on the table. I mean, now.
What do you want to bet?
If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.
You don't, huh?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice. But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five. Saving yourself for the main event. Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance.
Freezing. But I'm getting warmer.
Who?
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah. I saw one of'em outside.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Who was the friend?
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller. He's a fuckin'wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard. Hangs out with a couple other Grade A nutcases over on the West side.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Oh kay...
Yeah.
I bet. How much?
Low class of people there, Snoop.
Glenn didn't tell you?
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
The fuck you talking about?
You got two minutes, that's all. Make up your mind.
So you've done this before, huh?
Hey. You learn from doing.
Nervous?
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing do you?
There isn't any. All this shit you got in here. What is all this stuff anyway? Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
You devil, it's mace, huh? What've you got here, a billy? Use it on poor unfortunate offenders.
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too. Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
Guys like me, huh. Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you. I've never done that in my life.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt. And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
One I gave him, yeah. Fuck...
Why, are you famous?
How many was that?
That's funny.
It was me, I woulda left ol'Gus on the floor.
I know the difference. You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there. So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
I don't have to. I don't rob banks.
You don't act like it.
Jesus, you sound like my ex wife.
It was just a year, give or take a few days. I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything. We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know? That spark, you know what I mean? You gotta have that.
We still talk, though.
You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow.
Is that right?
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
Yeah, right. Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot? I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car eating a sandwich you wouldn't have known what hit you.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
Yeah...
I mean, romantically.
None of your business.
That's my dad.
How do you know? Wait you have my wallet.
Think I could have them back?
Let's see. You could come on by my dad's place, drop'em off.
Why not?
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Unless you wanna tell me.
One last score, that the idea? Move to some island.
Whatta you mean we'll make it an island?
Don't leave me.
No, they're all right. I meant, you just got here.
Well, we got that out of the way. Tell me, Celeste. What do you do for a living?
Is that how you think of yourself?
A girl.
I like your hair. And that suit.
You did?
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
How far do we go with this?
It's your game. I've never played this before.
Well, does it make sense to you?
Or once.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
If I remembered you. I came looking for you. I would've said sure, let's do it. But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team. Why would you trust me?
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
Why not?
You waved to me in the elevator.
Really? I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.
Outside Adele's.
So she did help you?
No, you're right. Or Buddy. I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit. Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill. Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
I don't know.
You know.
You think I'd shoot you?
I told you, I'm not going back.
You know what I mean.
You guys come on this is too heavy!
I'll take the shades off. Just get this fuckin'thing off me.
So. What's your point?
You think he's lying?
Oh, nuthin'.
You don't take'em off, I'm gonna throw'em off the overpass while they're still on your head.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that? Take her with you and put her in back.
The backseat.
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
I hear six.
Looks like tonight.
I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight thirty, right before lock down.
First of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you.
Really?
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
I know what you're talking about.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do you believe Glenn?
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep'em.
It's a big house.
I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way. I'm talkin'about when you're outta here. I mean, you can't rob banks for ever.
I don't know. I'm not exactly the nine to five type.
My ex wife's in Miami. It's nice down there.
The fish?
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to'em before.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
The next time I walk into a bank.
You goin'right back to work?
Jack, I'm disappointed. I guess I misjudged you.
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here? What's going on? Who's upstairs?
Maurice? From Lompoc? Good God.
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her. She told him I was down in Florida.
We'll go to my bank. I'll make a withdrawal.
Don't be an asshole, Richard. They're gonna kill you.
What's it mean, " No Hair "?
The flight?
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
Meaning?
You busted out?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
There were others.
The ninth?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
And so now you're off to Glades.
She did, huh.
Yeah, could be. Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
I don't know. It's a long way down to Florida.
No, that's not what I'm thinking.
Foley's not going to make it. And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.
Wait. Have you helped him, Glenn? At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice. You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard on. Or, if you want to play it another way...
Glenn, take the exit.
Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
I already stole it. Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm. I can't be stealing it again, can I?
Jesus. How'd you know about Snoopy?
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
What's going on, Glenn?
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Ripley? You mean the wall street guy?
And is Foley a part of this?
Why's that?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
Gee, I wonder why not.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
But listen, Glenn. If you're lying to me...
If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead. Look at it that way. Go on.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
It's a guy you know.
It's Richard Ripley.
It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros. I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players. Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left. Yeah. The brick wall. There's his drive, right there.
What?
Yeah. If you can step up and actually do it. Understand?'Stead of just talking the talk.
Walk in a house with me, do this cross dressin'nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin'on his own.
Right now, son.
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay? You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
Hey, shit, come on. I say I want this car, man, it's mine. You go get yourself another one. I say I'm in on Ripley? I'm in, with or without your ass. I say I want you to come along on another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do?
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
Why would I do that?
He took the week off so we'd have time together. So far he's worked on his boat every day. Dad? Ray Nicolet.
We went out there, full SWAT, two choppers, the whole bit, but Linares started shooting anyway. We put him down, but somehow Chirino got away.
I can tell.
Flyweight.
You're not my type.
Just a minute.
I'm looking for Maurice.
No.
No, I'm not. Maybe you know him. Glenn Michaels?
Here? In this house?
Well, he ain't even here that much. I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't want to know, you understand?
Got run over by a car.
I don't know the gym, the fights. I know he don't miss the fights. Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater. He use to take me.
Sig Sauer. 38. I love it.
Can't. I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
He was. Ray's with the F. B. I. now, he switched over.
Technically. They're separated.
He's about to.
Can we change the subject?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint. Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
No thanks.
Dad...
I really gotta go.
How'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
" Hey, yourself. "
Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas.
No, he looks a lot...
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
Maybe. But you're also curious about the man. Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him. You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley. You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike. It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.
You wave back?
I imagine you would've though.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
None I'd like to share.
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
My little girl, the tough babe.
Out for the evening?
When's he due back?
Let's go upstairs, have a look at the man's bedroom. All right now, you and Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here. Look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it. Look at the walls in the closets. The man has a safe, it's gonna be up there somewhere.
That's how you score now?
What?
I think it's Dunn  Brad street. But then, I could be wrong...
... and that extra pillow's gonna be an even three c's.
Where you been hiding, Dick?
Foley's got it.
What, good lookin'sumbitch?
Hide them? On a date with pilots? I'm talking about how you make them show!
No, I was.
You know the football player, Red G Grange? Well the guys called me R Red, cause you know, I'm red... and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G Grange, Red Str Strange.
How would I know.
Nervous?
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
Oh yeah. I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
I don't buy that hot dog shit. So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
You'll love it. No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
Too late for apologies, Walker.
What lizard?
What the hell happened to you guys?
No, like...
Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!
Land of the free...
There's another one!
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Don't make this a joke, Rafe. You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Some other time. I don't feel like a party.
Then why are you looking for her?
Let's go get a drink. Unless you're scared to talk about it.
I didn't mean it.
Waitress! Four beers!
If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
I understand how it could happen. I know why any guy would love her. And I can't blame you that it happened. You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
Yeah, right. Anyway, you didn't know.
I'm saying now you do know. So it's time for you to fuck off.
How's this for a fact? I loved her first.
She loves you. I know that. And part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me.
What's there?
I got a half a tank. You?
What do you mean? I'm just doing what we've always done.
We've always tried to beat each other.
We'll be loaded with 2, 000 pounds of bombs and 1, 500 pounds of fuel. I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. " Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork. " It means " Who the fuck thought up this shit? "
And I'm on yours. Land of the free.
Yes you can.
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
Yeah.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes. Real straight, frugal. My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along. Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral. He took me back to his house, and I never left.
I taught him to drink beer. He taught me how to fly.
... He said that?
That might not have been such a good idea. They're making us fly out of a half paved airfield. The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to. Rafe was... he was lonely. He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty. The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
From the air?
Then wh where do we land?
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too. But I think that'd just piss'em off. The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior. So let's try this again. Military targets only.
No baseball diamonds, Red.
Don't get smart with me, son.
That's bullshit, son. But it's really good bullshit.
Explain what?
Well sure, Colonel
I want to introduce a couple of people. Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man.
I know.
Sorry to trouble you.
Win?
I'm Evelyn. And I'm just a nurse. But I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs sewing, or else it's gonna make a big lumpy scar. Whatta ya say?
What do you get for winning?
I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man. They made me a cook and not even that, really I clean up after the other sailors eat. I shine the officer's shoes. In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun.
I was hoping to meet him.
It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.
I'm going to the war. The real war. Hitler's taken Europe. The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine. And not just there, but here.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R. A. F. They need pilots, and we need experience. I leave tomorrow.
I had to tell you in person. Because there's something else I need to say.
Maybe not. But I need you to know. I love you. And I will come back. I'll find a way. And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I... just stood there wondering if you knew. You looked... sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
... Survive? I jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me. I hit the water hard. And it was so... cold.
Nothing that won't heal. I guess.
Don't worry about that. Guys away from home, lonely, good hearted women try to cheer them up.
Rafe... No. You forgive me.
That's what I have to tell you, Rafe. It wasn't a choice. It
It must of been a convincing letter.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific. Include Hawaii the clutter will be more confusing that way.
A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war.
We must go ahead. This is our moment.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
Fook ya!
Fook ya dooble!
The time has come to strike! Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future. I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto that the Americans are strong. Yet look at their leader.
You see us as capable of such a blow?
I've been trying to drag it out of her for years. You know, dreams are fascinating business.'Specially where you see the future.
I remember that book! Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
I'd take better care of my teeth.
The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.
It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible.
Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Wouldn't we all.
Who knows. Remember... Whatever Walter wants...
Go on. You can do it.
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
He does?
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
What happened?
Welcome to the singles'scene.
Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.
 Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that " the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it ". Page eighty  six.
... to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
And nothing will ever change that.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
I'll think of a way to sell, them. One day.
No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie. Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Would I?!! Why I oughta...
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Yeah. Like that.
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Right. I promised my mother.
Charlie, how are you?
Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
He's trying.
Come on, let's dance.
Yeah I know. But I don't have to flatter you. It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me. As in is, was and always will be. I'm glad dancing was invented. You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.
You really love me, don't you?
Charlie, let's make love.
A lot's happened since last weekend.
I probably meant it when I said it. Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
Charlie. About last nights..
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
Why?
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight'cause of you. When the Monotones did " Book of Love   Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance... " I'm thinking Did we break up?'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
But what has to be different?
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us.  What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian!
Rusty's dead. That's Ajax
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Just take a look at it.
That's all I wanted to hear.'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, " Peggy, you're scared. " Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie. I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
What the hell is that?
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
Come back to me.
I thought you were... for a while.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.
You were terrific. And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Then hold me.
Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him'cause he has no friends.
Are you for real?
I beg your pardon?
Have a nice day.
Terry! Slow down.
First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
I'm not afraid. I know exactly when I'm going to die.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once. I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
You don't?
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
Coffee and a donut.
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say'No more Jell  O for me, Mom. '
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot. What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness. I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together. At least one more time.
You think so?
I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?
Don't eat the red ones.
They're bad for you. They cause... red lips.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis.
You look exactly the same.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that. You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
Dancing with you.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
I want to ask you a question. Do you think... time travel is possible?
Sort of.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
Okay. I promise.
You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
You're giving me the creeps.
There's one way to find out.
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
What if you're not here tomorrow?
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty  fifty.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life  styles.
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
Oh. And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Yep. It's going to be a law. I broke up with Charlie last night.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Like what?
What do you know about hypnosis?
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
What will they be made of?
Silicon is from sand.
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
Will you take of f your blouse?
One... two... three. You are now awake.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
Not true. I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
You were meant to You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie... I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
Exactly! I thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or...
Wait, there must be some mix up. He was... the dog is alive.
Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander...
What do they do up there?
You sure did...
I still can't believe she's dead...
I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep?
Sorry about your mom. I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus...
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
Why not?
The old Indian burial ground.
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...
Dies?
I miss him too...
Charles is right behind me.
Bailey, Brackman.
You'll never find it in the dark.
What's wrong with your face?
Allright. Calm down.
Maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. We'll try combinations of those letters...
Whacked with a racquetball. I appreciate your faith in my abilities.
Really? Who thinks that, sir?
You're not smiling.
Drew!
We're not skipping this treatment.
Fuck you.
That shit's saving your life, you asshole!
I'm not going to close the
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? " Begin to prepare for the inevitable. "
What's that mean?!
I'm not going to die.
You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into victims?
I'm not ready to die.
Whatever.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
We're waiting...
I know what it means. Your Honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. The pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! And Counselor calls it harmless?!
Uh, yeah.
Congratulations.
Kids are great.
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
Nine.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
My lover and I.
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
I dove back into work, everything was fine. Until the lesions started...
Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today.
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
Correct. I don't.
Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet.
Find a lawyer?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
Rayisha.
No. They didn't fire her.
Arline?
It's me, you dork.
Get it?
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
You're right.
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
Beckett?
What?
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
I've considered that.
We proceed, representing your estate.
I know a good probate lawyer.
Opera?
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street. The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
You didn't look then, the way you look now?
Except... you were gay?
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
Can you explain why you didn't?
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
What do you love about it?
If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an accurate idea of what we're talking about.
Thank you.
A good start.
Catch me later, I'll be here. And tell Amy, I love her painting, it's on my wall.
What can I do?
Do you take risks?
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Have you ever been to the Apollo Cinema on Sansom Street?
Gay pornographic movies?
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
But you were having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
You'd heard of AIDS in 1984, 85?
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
In some situations.
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
Yes.
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
No. I can't really see it.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Where's Dad?
Thanks, Mom... Dad?
Were you recently promoted?
Thank you.
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
Your earrings?
I said my earrings are American. They're African American.
Were you pleased with his work?
According to the deposition, you said you were " thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed " by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
We don't think it's fair to keep you here, where your future is limited. But we wish you luck, Andy, all the luck in the world.
... we've got a committee meeting.
People who want to bend the rules...
Great.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think...? You think I'm...... gay?
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
You're the asshole, buddy.
Lots.
Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets.
Since when?
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? " Is that mine? I thought it was yours. " Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't stand that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Would you take a client if you were constantly thinking: " I hope this guy doesn't touch me. I don't even want him to breathe on me? "
Have you changed your aftershave?
Two men making love...? Now tell me again... why is that disgusting?
Going on... like...?
We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it.
Like firing Andrew Beckett taught him a lesson?
I know the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to? What is it, Bob?!
He was doing a great job.
No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer.
If you feel differently, Bob, you should say so, when you're called to the stand. After all, this isn't a conspiracy.
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Not sure. I was just runnin'away when this whole thing....
Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
What whispers?
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Strange, not doin'a run up on the main drive yet. Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
An'now you're worried about a repeat of history?
I asked what you thought.
But I just wanted to say
Actually... That's what I been askin'myself.
So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? Until you can't see what's eating you? That the big plan?
Audrey?
As fast as you can.
What, you're afraid?
I trusted you, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
' Course I am but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
Here. Make it easy on you.
Just give me your hand.
No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn.
You barely know them.
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
How many bottles?
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn? If you got a receipt?
Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
What, switch what?
Hey, me. Over here.
We just keep him locked up forever?
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Which means he went toward sunrise.
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
Thought he might be coolin'it in the boneyard could either double back to the ship or slip in behind us. So I left the bottle out as bait.
Like my pistola.
So why isn't it all bloody?
I am sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw jackin', loves making you afraid,'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into
Well, don't ask me to.
I don't. But that ground looked none too stable, and I don't want anyone
What, you think I'm doin'this to prove something?
Thanks for the tip, Johns.
15 6 gigs here... 90 gigs total... other ship carries 20 gig cells, so... five. Five total to launch.
Wha'?
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to
Get the fucking cells over here, Johns. What's the discussion?
Okay, maybe that's a good thing. Maybe I can use him to help with
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
Never said you were a hype, either.
Not a problem unless you're gonna make
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
Smoke screen for what?
Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
How much?
Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and that's why you can't come up with a better plan.
You give him the cells and the ship and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces you know, I'm startin'to enjoy myself out here.
No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin'pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get
Just shut up, okay?
Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
Somethin'knocked us off lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad.
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall at all?
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. I'm Owens. Right?
You mean that " load " of passengers?
When captain went down, you stepped up whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so
Some prophet guy?
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
Frightening thought.
No, I'm not. But he can.
Don't stop, just slow down. Little more space'tween us and them.
Do what I say. Please.
You mean....
And pointless.
You don't see.
Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
SULEIMAN!
It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
Wanna rag your fat mouth?
How'bout a cut in your gut?
Well, what's it look like now?
What if you're one of five?
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Trawl with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
Don't wanna feed these land sharks just keep'em off our scent.
Don'look, don'look, don'look....
What's one more to you? Like this is the one that sends you to Hell?
Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
' Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
I know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency.
Startin'to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
I apologize.
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
The best. But we won't need them.
It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
I know... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
Shut up.
Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
Neither do I.
Watch. Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
The blood transfusion.
Where did you learn to do this?
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
That the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time
You didn't think so then.
How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape
Well, maybe they're not.
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Geiger counter?
One pistol... twenty four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9. We've enough food and water for three days.
Good question. Landon check your communications kit.
No.
Any particular reason?
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
Hmph.
They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that...
Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster...
Of course he doesn't know our culture because he cannot think. Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
He's trying to form words.
I'll see.
Do as I say.
To Earth! That we've landed!
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
By our time. You've turned gray.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for they're dust.
It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
I'm prepared to die.
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever. Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
Dodge... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why he's here. But you... You're no seeker. You're negative.
I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
Come on. Get me out of here.
I want her.
Fine. Just let her out.
Relax. You'll see it all later.
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
That's the boy. Keep'em flying.
The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed. Don't try to follow us. I'm pretty handy with things like this.
All right... Get in... hurry. Put this on.
To scare off humans?
I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash.
We're conducting a new experiment.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
Did we create his mind too? Not only can this man speak. He can write. He can reason.
' I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained... "
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
No.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
Then how is it we speak the same language? Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from Fort Wayne'?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent. Where were you nurtured?
Certainly not. You're a mutant.
Of course.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly. The eastern desert has never been explored because we've always assumed that no life can exist there. Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone. You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one. Guards!
Twelve hundred years ago.
Of course.
Sure. In a cage.
No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
What is this?
Second from the left.
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
You want her that much?
Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
It's humiliating.
It's better than going to prison for heresy.
But perhaps he understood
Do you believe him?
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished? You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
Where are they now?
Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
What?
Yeah. Back about 100 metres. He's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin'place.
Fuckers returned fire soon as we lit'em up. Hard core fuckin'NVA. They got their shit together.
YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
Shit. Get your boots on Martin, next time I catch you putting mosquito repellent on your fuckin'feet I'm gonna courtmartial your nigger ass.
Bob, I got Elias'R  R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy. I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief?
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know? Y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become'pacifists'so's we don fight Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what bunch of hopheads, they think they special...
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man.
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
Yeah?
You lame or something?
' Lias come naturally.
... See them go down? Like fuckin'target practice man, fuck you Charlie!! Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dick!... Crawford!
I suggest you watch your own asses cause Barnes gonna be down on ALL OF'EM.
You're wrong man! Any way you cut it Rhah, Barnes is a murderer.
They're scared? What about me! I'm sick of this shit man, I'm sick of this shit! They don't want us here! Who do you think they're fighting for! GET OUTTA THERE!
Jes'fine man, jes fine! Ain't never felt better! Both of us two timers man, we're out. See you at the hospital man, we gonna get high high yessir...
Then the worm has definately turned for you man.
Feelin'good's good enough.
... beautiful night.
That's a nice way of putting it.
And you, do you believe?
You really think so... us?
Yeah, those are the guys that live. I really don't think Death gives a shit, it's like a giant garbage can, I think it takes whatever it can get... you never know where it's gonna come from anyway... so why spin your wheels?
What you got there beers?
You WHAT? Say'gain.
Here have some of this. Won't feel a thing.
Later...
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
Does a chicken have lips? Whoever said we did, babe. Make it outta here, it's all gravy, every day of the rest of your life man gravy. Oh shit, superlifer!
Forty two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD.
March man in Tennessee, sniff the pines... sniff that crossmounted pussy walkin'down by the river. What you got Taylor? Let's see three hundred and WHAT?
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Fuck you Elias.
What are you talking about!
No I don't. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias!
Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them I got five live bodies left...
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
You don't want to hear about it?
Right...
Vancouver, B. C.
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
I'll make one for you. I live there.
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
Indefinitely?
You don't know.
No thanks?
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector. A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
Don't get me wrong, Betty. I'm not suggesting you murdered anybody, you know.
What's the matter?
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock? A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.
Okay. You win.
If I change my mind.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry. Otherwise they might think...
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield. Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
It's open house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But.. If you really want a good dry Martini..
Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before, wouldn't you?
And do you amuse the guests?
You're drinking it.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
I didn't say anything.
I hate to be alone. But I've heard all the approaches there are... even yours.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.
Don't take it so big... it isn't a tragedy.
There's one less tonight.
Not with my consent, strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything.
How did you meet him?
Nice of him.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
There's a lot of night left to live through.
Dance? Tonight?
Certainly not to me.
You, too? My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.
Why not?
I know everybody. I don't look at half of life, just the nice half, I look at all of it.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
Then he's got to be a detective.
Then he's
We'll find out.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
Us?
Why?
Anything I can do about it?
Try not talking.
No use waiting, then.
From you, I like it.
I don't think that's on the market anymore. I'd like something much closer to the water.
You're probably mistaken about that. Let's get together sand talk it over. There's always a solution to these problems. But it must be near the water. Quite near Yes, if you don't mind waiting.
They're going to arrest me.
I have my own warrant. Stop a minute, please.
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U. S. A. This note is a suicide note. After you're gone where would they look for you? Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser. And I have a pocket full of money. And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
How bad is it? Bad enough for
I was tried for murdering my husband. Guilty. The judge set the verdict aside. There was one man on the jury but he was afraid. They were all afraid of my father in law. That man followed me last night he came from him of course. My father in law will never give up. Never. He promised me that. So I came to Vancouver, B. C. As far away as I can get from North Carolina. And it happens all over again. Almost the same thing. Almost the same way. Do you wonder about this
I run over to Victoria. Play some golf with some people I know. Do it all the time. That's why I have a cabin cruiser. Custom built. Forty knots. Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure. Member of six golf clubs. Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course. You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie. Came alone? Sure. He always comes alone. Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
Blonde, beautiful, and sad and nowhere. Of course she might have run away if she knew how. And where to go. She might have dyed her hair. Bleached it before probably. And changed her name again. But look at this note. And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there. Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that. Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
If they had any reason to. Why make it tough for themselves? Why go to all that trouble? Here's an open book. Close it. No reason to keep it open. She was a nice girl, anyway. And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose. Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know. Give her the benefit of the doubt. Leave her stay where she is. Close the book. Finis.
The best interference runner we've got. He thinks he's in love with you and he's a gentleman. Come here, baby.
It did, but it never paid off until now. I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am.
There would be a moon tonight.
Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink. Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now.
If you're doing all this just for me.
I thought you had to be back to the hotel. To leave my my note.
Including Killaine... I still can't think of you that way.
Larry Mitchell found out. So you killed him.
So could you. But our records were a little against us.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb smart collage boy, and he was my father. I thought it was a legitimate business. He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies. I never saw the pies. They had names. For the record. Innocent names. You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
No. I paid him off.
Not this one. And not Mitchell.
Magruder obliged me. No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up. I'm not a dumb smart college boy anymore. Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
Don't go soft on me, baby. I've got your note in my pocket. You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it. It has to be found in exactly the right place.
Mine?
Mitchell was dead enough.
Who'd believe it but you? I took him out to sea and threw him in the water. Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
Would I want to?
Shut up! Cut it out! Even if I have to kill both of us
Me?
If I did I don't now.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Right, Miss.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell. Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat. A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
That's an evasion and you know it.
There's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.
I'm sorry.
Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
Where's you get it?
I probably shall after I've tortured you a little more.
You must come from pretty far South.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
You've had dealings with the police before?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons. Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
You've has an experience that you don't want to talk about. An unhappy marriage, for example.
We try to be decent.
If I understand what you meant by that.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
I've come here to arrest you for murder.
You wouldn't even try There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes
Palm trees against a sunset waves breaking on a coral reef the Taj Mahal by moonlight roses in an English garden, just after a shower Clich  s, one and all but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them there's one thing he does not see murder and murder was what he was sent to find. Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
That's my hard luck I'm man enough to tell you about it and not be sorry.
They call me Jeff.
Not quiet yet. We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West. She told us this morning. It doesn't mean much. Mitchell took it away from her. He had a habit of going through her bag.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up. There's no indication you handled it.
Time's up. I'm off the case.
That's something I can't spare you. But I won't do it myself.
I'm enough of a copper to do my duty. My boss made it tough for me. If I don't arrest you, I've gone soft. If I do, it's to save my face. I don't play those rules.
I can't answer that.
That's they're business. Can I drop you somewhere?
What proper grounds? You can't be in love with me. You hardly know me. I'm not in love with you.
But even if you were in love with me.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
Not sometimes. Always. Just because it is the hard way. You're that kind of man, Jeff.
No, Jeff. You don't. He's not a murderer, I tell you. He; s not a murderer.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Name it.
What are your rates?
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
I don't know whether to knock your teeth down your throat or call the police or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
I go home and paint the kitchen.
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
Got it on you?
Get it in half an hour.
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
You, Killaine?
And without much discrimination.
They still hang women in Canada, I've heard.
That comedian?
So you're not a cop.
Who told you my name?
The usual grind.
If I can get off.
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
That's what I thought, at first. Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party. With my liquor of course.
Quite sure you had no motive?
No.
We do, when we get the chance.
Well good night.
Thanks. I don't mind.
I would. Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap. Wonderful thing, money is. Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it?
" Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others. " Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
Sure. Let's discuss Betty Mayfield. How long since you saw her?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon. I'd like to go on thinking so. If you tried to help her get away
You'd be breaking the law.
The only answer I have for you.
Information.
It could have been an accident.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
How could Mitchell? After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
Romeo in reverse. Uh uh. No sale, Killaine.
No idea.
Wait a minute. I'll go with you.
I tried it once. I lost my shirt.
Where did it all come from? Or is that a permissible question?
You asked me where it all came from.
Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby?
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
A little something on account perhaps?
I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
What do you want?
Passkey?
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
You nasty, sardonic
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
So he did but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
Convenient, isn't it?
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him and I know why.
Recently, then.
Thank you.
Not a floater. Only just dead.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years. This man hadn't been dead an hour. He wasn't killed last night. He was killed today. In broad daylight. That's no drunk rolling job.
You told me when we'd identified this fellow
If you'd seen the blood on his head and some body had to carry him out to sea
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business. Greer won't give out.
Send that?
If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.
Men like you don't need orders.
We don't need him.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
What do I get for it?
Sounds like a fair swap. Let's take a look.
When you sign for it, you count it. It's your dough.
Right.
It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him. I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
I guess I'm just ballast around here.
Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
There wasn't any motive... let's try out the act.
Where's the shell?
They'll probably believe you. But they'll want to know what you were fighting about. Why Mitchell had a gun. You'll tell them a simple story. They'll pretend it sounds all right to them. Now you're headquarters. How does it sound to you?
Exactly. Now I'm the killer. And there's something I don't want you to know. Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble. What do I do? What would you do?
You can find out.
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.
I've handled it. Mitchell's handed it. If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide. If I leave it here.... no suicide.
I've got to find a way to handle it, openly. Like Brandon.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
No suicide.
You win, Inspector. You win all along the line. Why didn't we think of Brandon before or did we some of us. Yeah. Of course you did. When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
Are you always this witty?
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Thank you very much, Mrs. West.
Other people always know so much more than we know so much more than they're willing to tell us.
I am a fool.
Yes and he's already becoming vague to me. Funny! Last night I was furiously jealous. Jealous of what? I out that gun in my bag deliberately. Who was I going to kill with it? A girl I didn't even know? A man I knew to be a thief and a forger? A half man? A gigolo? It's already ludicrous. Love! What a comedy!
Did you ever have a serious operation?
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock. Then it hurts terribly you wouldn't believe such pain could exist and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like. It hasn't taken six months this time. It hasn't even taken twenty four hours. Is that a beastly thing to say?
It does. May I go now?
I don't understand.
Now, you're being beastly.
And if you didn't believe me?
She's the only one who had a dead man in her room. The only one who won't give an account of herself. The only one who tried to run away. And the only one, so far, I've been told, who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes. What more do you want?
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine. Where's the girl now?
Well, find out. Who's covering her?
Ye have, have ye?
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
" Superintendent J. McKechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Replying your inquiry Elizabeth Kinsolving. Subject was indicted, first degree murder her husband, Lee Kinsolving, January this year. Guilty verdict set aside by presiding judge. Prisoner discharged, Whereabouts now unknown. Fingerprint classification " And exact correspondence, Killaine.
But you still think she's innocent.
You're a young man. You're romantic. You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart. You'll grow out of that.
This badge is not an old newspaper you can cast down on the desk. It is not a thing you can give up as of no value. It may be taken from you and you may die defending it. But you'll not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with. It's a naked steel of the sword of Justice. Put it back in your pocket and hold tight to it and someday you might grow into a worthiness ye lack now.
You think I'm wrong about this bit of a girl. Go out and prove it against me!
So so.
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
I have a rough idea.
Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
Kind or not kind. What's the difference? It always ends up the same way.
How long have you had it?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
I didn't mean it that way I'm sorry.
Of course.
I told you she's just..
Right.
Be nasty.
In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there.
Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden. And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say'please'.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler. Suez was very important for our generation. I didn't want it to be forgotten. And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since. I don't think I'm your man.
I see. Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
Good. Suez was a minefield for both parties.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
And I'd like you to call me Ann.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
She'll be here next weekend. Why don't you come too, James? I'll  show you the marshes properly. If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Don't be silly. I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome.
These are transcripts of various radio broadcasts, including Gaitskill's, the one they tried to stop. You ought to have that...
Did he? I left school and worked for the Labour Party. My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member. I hero worshipped him. He was 25 years old... It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war. We thought the country was about to become a true democracy. I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time. They feel betrayed. They want to know what went wrong.
Oh, many things. Inertia... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve. We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge. A new broom with very old bristles. When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism.
This is Jill, Carol, Betty, Mandy, Louise, Pete over there, and I'm Carmen.
I'll suggest it. Remember though, we're news, not features. It might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police. Anyway, I'll be back with this soon. Thanks.
Working hard on that book I was telling you about. Coming to the meeting?
Keep me company.
No. That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary? Who was the old one anyway?
I won't introduce you all by name. Basically James, this is our UK sales team. What was I saying? Yes, these graduate trainees...
I'll have some of that.
And some of that. Sorry.
Good.
Are you going to have coffee?
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
You know the lingo. Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
It's everything we wanted. A very good read. A terrific piece of work. So, here's to you and Suez.
Yes, that's right. I'm being terribly rude. Bob? Oh, Bob. This is Bob Tuckett. Bon was at Oxford too.
I thought it was tremendous.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
Oh, but he was terrific.
Really? I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
Good theory. But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
My real father? Well, he was a flashback.
No, there's a fourth. Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
Oh yes?
It makes me weepy just to remember it. So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials. What about yours.
That must be rather nice, in a way. I mean, you don't have any
I called you a taxi.
Well, you know...
Me too.
Too late. Just my luck.
In radio we're different.
Did she talk about me?
Well, you should.
He's all right, the professor.
Might?
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
In your car
To the airlift.
Not yet you know any of these people?
Nonsense.
And the Argies.
You approve!
Get way. You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying
You're so hard. All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up. I expressed an interest...
... an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called'Mothers and Daughters'Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington. Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
Ah, ah. There's more. The piece celebrates the undying affection between eminent left wing historian and he dazzling daughter. Then the news editor, who happened to be in the room, said that years ago, when he worked on The Guardian, Anne Barrington had written a very good piece on... guess... Suez. It was 1966, the tenth anniversary.
It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
She's very nice, apparently. Lives in Norfolk. And very left wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often. You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
No need to thank me, if you don't want to. Just pay for these drinks.
Far too long.
The torture of small children
Hold those rights.
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton. Perhaps you should come too.
I'll ring you.
Big mistake, I think. You might have learned a lot.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her. I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
It might have worked. Really. I would have been delighted for you if it had. But she wasn't interested. Not my fault.
I've known Susan for more than fifteen years. James, we're old allies.
I'm waiting for your mother.
Thanks.
Okay, I will.
Oh, I see.
Not at all. History.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
It goes from Henry VIII. Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
They don't count.
Terrific.
I'm terribly sorry. He doesn't seem to be here... No... Yes, if I see him, I will... Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
Well, it's worth seeing.
What would you call it?
Ploughman's Lunch. Traditional English fare.
In fact it's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs. A completely successful fabrication of the past, the Ploughman's Lunch was.
You weren't really interested in Suez at all. Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
No, no, let me go on before you get the wrong idea. Ann and I have kept to our separate bedrooms for the last three years. And I can't imagine that Susan hasn't hinted at the kind of life I lead in London. I'm not telling you how to run your affairs. I'm just saying... I don't mind. I'm giving you permission.
You're so famous now.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools. World history since 1945. Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
They won't let you in without one.
Oh, yes! Where's mine? I want to look like you.
Promise.
It's true! I was here last year doing a piece, remember? I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs. They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet. They all stood round me like children saying'You! Working for television? You're just a young thing.'They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying'Oo, can I? '
No, he wasn't. He just lowered himself into a bar stool and said...'Oo I do feel bad. I'ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees! '
' Night.
Actually, I've been once today already. I'll stay here with him.
And that's why you never went pro?
Mmm. A lawyer, huh? Too bad. But at least you're surfing now. So your life's not over yet, right?
What's their program?
You always talk like this? You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
Thanks for stepping in.
Come with Tyler. She knows.
I've watched you once or twice. You surf like it's some kind of street fight. You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you. Always trying to win.
The only way to win out here is to surrender. You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync. Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
Pure adrenalin, right?! The ultimate rush. Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it all you gotta do is jump.
Yeah, I noticed you limping. But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all. We're not gonna land on land!
I did. What's the matter? Don't trust me?
Then we'll earn it together. Here, take mine.
I'll take that as a yes.
One thousand feet. Pull the goddamn cord!
Okay!
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
Good guess. There's a gun on you right now.
You gotta tell me where she is.
Look, Bodhi man. People are dead. The ride is over.
The guy you killed was an off duty cop! If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land. They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it.
Naw, you pull it!
Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man. Do it! Come on, you want to do it. You're gonna die, Johnny. Five more seconds. Four...
You never were...
All the food groups? Avoiding sugar? Caffeine? I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness. We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
That's right. And we nailed over a thousand of them. We did it by crunching data. Good crime scene work, good lab work, good data base analysis. Nobody had to tackle a car once. You getting the signal, special agent?
Surf conditions okay?
A little mushy! You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
What?
Cole and Munoz. I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
Yeah, I get it. Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
Smart. You burn time in the vault.
Forget about it, kid. They're ghosts. Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it. See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right? They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public. Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
You watch your fucking mouth! Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!
Yeah. What's your theory?
Thanks for the tip. I needed this knowledge.
It's all balance, right? And coordination. How hard can it be?
Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.
Got it.
Bodhi, yeah. I'm on him all day, right. He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
Cute. He was inside for about 20 minutes. The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck. They were scoping it out, right?!
Wait, wait. Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit. Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit. You see? Summer's almost over. They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow. The next day at the outside latest. I got a feeling.
Angelo... I'm right this time. We can still win this one.
I say we don't call it in. Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
That place up the street has meatball sandwiches. Get me two.
You sure?!
NOOO!!
I mean, what do you want? What are you doing hanging around here.
Gimme a break. One shrimp and fries to go! Anything to drink?
I can see that. But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at. Miniature golf. Here, your number's 37.
This gonna take long?
Oh, oh. That sounds personal.
Meaning you were expendable.
Sure, he's " the Bodhisattva ".
I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny. You've got it. And Bodhi can smell it a mile away. He'll take you to the edge... and past it. Hey, Bodhi.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you. See, it's gone. If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
You don't have to.
No. I'm sorry. I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
You're kneeling on my hand.
But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash? DID THEY?!
My name's Johnny Utah!
I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
Six others, U. S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
You never did know when to quit.
Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
Go on.
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
Well somebody sent them.
Why us?
What story did you give to Davis?
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
That rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles, at most! We're almost home. But the chopper won't wait.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major...... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped off two hundred rounds and then the Mini gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin'on this earth could have lived... not at that range.
We both got scores to settle.
Someone else will be going in with you.
Mmmnnn...?
I can't tell.
Where the hell is his body?
Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
I dunno. Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
They never are, dear.
Do what you have to do. I don't take it personally.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing. Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
Thunder's a horse. Come on.
Hope to be?
Not with those smokestacks it's not.
I talked to some developers about the land.
Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished. You've won.
No. What I have is a lot of money.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
It is not your company. It's a public company. And I am going to acquire it. Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you.
Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights. I'll get used to it.
Of course, yes. After the expected filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
You looking'for some company?
What? You gonna tell me you're lost?
Great. What do I look like a tourguide?
Good. Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
That's ridiculous.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Sit and spin. Alright... why not?
Stolen?
New York.
Ho tel.
Regent Beverly Wilshire. I bet you know it.
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
So do day jobs.
Very good. You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
Sorry. If I did, I didn't mean to.
For the whole night?
You're joking.
Neither do I. A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
You couldn't afford it.
What's your name, lover.
Edward... you got it!
You know how to drive a stick?
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Exactly.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
And a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.
Always.
Fair enough.
Uh huh.
And why do you say that?
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
Yes...
No hurry. Would you like some breakfast?
Occupational hazard?
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
No? Why's that?
What? Why?
Vivian
Assets are anything of value a company owns. Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole. By selling them off, I make a profit.
Not... quite.
Where'd you learn to do this?
Don't drown.
I'm in town until Saturday.
Five full nights... days too?
But you want days too.
Three.
Holy shit.
Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.
Did you buy some clothes?
Just one? Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
Let's hope so. You'll get some more clothes tomorrow. I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty five sharp. Got it?
This isn't a date.
The Rex.
I think you'll approve.
Thank you very much.
Oooh!
You liked the guy, though.
We're the exactly the same! Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks that's why no kissing it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it. Except with you. At your price I give my all...
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound. You don't have to use your brain at all.
Uh uh. No work.
Why not?
Was someone rude to you?
Vivian, you belong wherever you are. I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.
Come with me?
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
Seems like it. I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
What id we run into someone I know?
You did.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass. She anything like your ex?
I thought I was the pro. These women make me feel like an amateur.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Stuckey! He wants an " appointment " with me after you leave. You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
Can we talk about this? Can you just try to calm down?
Pay me! Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Fuck off.
I really am sorry.
What if I lose it?
What if someone tries to steal it?
To meet some friends. Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
The opera.
You mean, besides Elvis? I'm a human being. Sure. Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy. He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago. They stopped at a gas station. He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other. Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time. He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things. The two of us getting married someday. Having kids. Stupid stuff.
But don't they have it in English?
I know. I'm glad.
Yes. I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.
I have to go to New York tomorrow.
I'm sorry. That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
I've never treated you like a whore.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy. Now he's beaten. And you liked him.
Right.
Business.
It's all just business to you. Him. Me. Your life. Everything's business.
Right. You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'? I heard what you did with Kross.
It felt good.
I do. I do want to. That's why I'm leaving. That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now. I want a guy like you for real. Not because you buy me things and give me money. The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?
It's not your fault. You're right. Kit's right. But I want the fairy tale.
At least stay for a drink. This party's for you.
Cynthia's not coming?
I'll see him alone. Everyone knows you're my muscle. We'll make it social. Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner. Tonight if you can arrange it.
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia. I'll see you in the office. By the way, about your car...
I'll bring it back.
I know a lot of nice girls.
No one you know.
Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there. We can bleed'm dry.
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
Do it.
And some of it's mine. Edward, his jugular's exposed.
Come on, you can tell me. I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
And you just happened to run into her. Great. What's she do? She work?
Doing what?
Sales, really? That's great. What does she sell?
You're being ridiculous.
Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker. I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard.
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
I had to call. I jus got off the phone with James Kross. Get this. He wants to see you. Today.
He wouldn't say. Edward... I think we got him. His nuts are on the block and we got him. You there?
We'll be there. Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office. I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
Have you lost your mind?
Edward, we've been together ten years.
All this because of that whore!
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
No, let's go to work. Okay?
Forget it. We work for it. We keep it.
Hey, hey There's a rent.
I was asleep. You woke me. You okay?
Why'd he want you?
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes. Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent. Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes? Good stuff on him.
Yeah.
Who did you think?
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Yeah... I know what you mean.
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
I know. I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
It was great.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it. I don't know what to do. What do I do, Kit?
I don't care about bucks. I might love this guy.
What kind of school?
So did I. I made it with the principal. Study hard And get a " B. " Lift your dress and an " A " you'll see.
Cool your jets a second. Here's some money.
I want to. For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
Don't give me that. Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
You bullshittin'me?
Oooh, I love those.
Thanks! Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?
All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard.
Till they kill you. Yeah.
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
But what if something happens to you?
But how can you be sure?
I told you, " I would always come for you. " Why didn't you wait for me?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
There will never be a need.
I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. 59.
Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? " Gently? "
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
What?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin. Go!
Am I going mad or did the word " think " escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
I do not accept excuses. I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
True!
Yeah?
I don't think more than ten.
Look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.
Have you any money?
I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. 91.
Has it been fifteen minutes?
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
I hope we win...
Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
I'll say how do I find the Count? Once I do, how do I find you again? Once I find you again, how do we escape?
No.
Anything you want
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
What?
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right tch over too quickly.
Guess what.
Your grandfather's here.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
Maybe he won't.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth. She owns 100  of the profits.
" Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt. "
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
People can hear you.
I need it. How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
Oh, in show business. Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing Sing. How'd you know that, you been up?
Who can we attack? They're all too big.
We can't... we keep our money there!
What did you tell the people?
Hey, baby, that's good! How'd we come out?
Groovy!
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use. This used to be the main highway. Want to register, please?
No trouble. Today's linen day. I change all the beds once a week, whether they've been used or not... dampness. I hate the smell of dampness. It's such a dank smell.
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days... What was it you wanted to ask?
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
Oh.
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
Look at the picture. Please.
I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities. I shouldn't even bother to change the linen. I guess habits die hard. Which reminds me...
You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
Very early. Dawn.
The following morning. Sunday.
No.
No.
No.
No! Of all...
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
What do you mean?
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
What?
Cash.
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
Not at all!
Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like. Come on.
I live there. Alone.
My mother.
Of course not.
Now, look...!
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me. But... She didn't fool my mother.
No. I told you, she's confined...
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
All right! Might save me a lot of leg work if I could just talk to your mother. But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I?
Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator. Where is she, Miss Crane?
What are you talking about? What is this?
I don't believe it. Do you?
Casharoonie!
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Forty thousand dollars.
He didn't mention the money. What he said on the phone isn't important, is it? He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions! I'm sorry if I seem over anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
I don't know.
Sure...
Is Mary here?
Here?
Where?
What's the matter?
No. I take it you don't either? How long?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
I was getting to that!
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
What thing could we be in together?
Is Mary... in trouble?
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
I ought to call the police right now!
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
She haven't even called you?
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
You want me to stay here?
Where... can I stay?
It's been three.
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
I feel better when you feel better.
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Arbogast said...
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road? Thanks.
You'll never find it.
I don't know... One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Contemplate your... panic button.
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home... A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
In a hurry.
Yes. I think he would have.
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
Nothing. Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
No. I'm just procrastinating. People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night. Come on.
Yes.
Alive.
She was willing to lick the stamps.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
Huh?
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
I believe it.
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell... what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else? Forty thousand dollars?
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us. Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
What?
Yes. But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
Bates.
We could laze around here a while longer.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
I'm sorry, Mary. My old Dad used to say'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.'Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
For what?
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working class tragedy!
You can't laugh at it, huh?
Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal. Next best thing to no conscience at all.
I can come down next week.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
All right.
I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work. But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re marries, the alimony stops... and then...
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
How can you even think a thing like that!
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies. They moved away the highway.
I knew you must have. No one stops here anymore unless they do.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
Norman Bates.
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
Then will you do me a favor? Will you have supper here? I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...... with my trusty umbrella.
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
Not really. I hear that expression, that one eats " like a bird, " is really a falsie, I mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot. Oh, I don't know anything about birds. My hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because... well, I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but I can't... I think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather... passive, to begin with... most of them...
I imagine so.
A man should have a hobby.
Is your time so empty?
You go out... with friends?
Only my share.
I'm looking for a private island.
Why do you ask that?
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
You should... mind it.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
She sounded strong...
Except you.
Why don't you go away?
No, not like me.
Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
What do you mean about caring? Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there? Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
Well? You meant well? People always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that...
Thank you, Norman.
You're not going to... to your room already?
Phoenix?
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast. What time will you...
Alright, Miss...
That's it.
You slept here all night?
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
No, m'am.
Is anything wrong?
Frankly, yes.
Is there?
Now wait just a moment! Turn your motor off, please.
No need to apologize...
Please.
We'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it.
I'll show you the cabin.
Satisfied with your cabin?
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening! You are alone here, aren't you? It would drive me crazy.
Just an expression... What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away. Wouldn't you?
And now that your mother's dead?
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
... Forty thousand dollars!
And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates'mother.
It is you know what a struggle he's had.
He hardly knew of them him self. I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
Okay I'll be here at eight.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey you are here in time to help me and you can
Ha ha, you have been treating.
What do you mean  quot; our  quot;?
I don't know,  I tell you .
Who wants your money maybe I can help you.
Why, yes, to you, Mr. Mr. what?
Dr. Meirschultz, too?
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
 Lot of  How many cats you have what's the matter rats?
Oh, I see. Cats'fur.
But where do the rats come in?
Yeah, he was picked up also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
So that's it. Buckley took the body.
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
I'd like to have a look.
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
Come on, we're wasting time.
Go to sleep!
You're losing your blood?
Nonsense!... It's here!... Your blood...
That spoke to you?
What did it say?
The master... is asleep!
There's no child here.
No! Good night!
But you were in on it you worked for him.
You lie!
I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.
I don't see any big moneyed boys running after you.
Did you? Where?
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused... but I've never hit one with dough. This love in an attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
All right, you raise the kids I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough plenty of dough.
Then marry Ralph... you'll be the happiest couple in the world.
Why didn't you eat last night?
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
I won't let you say that!
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
That's the way I feel about it.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me...... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
No I wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
But it was really my fault.
I'd love to.
Ralph! Ralph!
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
Are you giving me this straight?
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
How quaint. But I can go any place you can.
I don't know what he was, but he made Frankenstein look like a lily!
Where did you get the news item? From a little bird?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
Meaning what?
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
Quick, Watson, the cookbook!
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o'print because his great grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Oh, you won't you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey a little while ago
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Whooey he took a run out powder.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Hey, come here, Sob sister!
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Hey, Mattie, dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on Joan Gale.
Jim, there's a little hokey pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
Just this I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line up, then I'm crazy.
What!
Listen, Jo jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure... Bingo!... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
Let it go.
All right, Master Mind. But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is.
What do you mean?
No kiddin'?
Almost! I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
I'm going to make you eat dirt, you soap bubble! I'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go!
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
No kiddin'.
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
Do you know George Winton?
That's the one.
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
Thanks.
What do you mean police dog?
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard Tack is pretty sore.
Here's a wow.
Don't worry she'll get used to it.
Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
Yes, sure, that's fine. While I'm proving my innocence, you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick I ever did... you're going to write editorials about every cocktail I ever drank. Anything that any sane, normal person might have done will have a sinister meaning, if I did it. Go on! Get out! I don't want to talk to you!
That's what I said.
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Uh huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
I see. Was that all she said?
You weren't going with her?
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
That happens to be the truth.
That's what they're going to ask you.
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
Darned if I don't!
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you you were in a tough spot when I met you.
Oh, is that what caused it?
How much money have you got?
Well, that being the case, I'll take it up with the board of directors. Hey, listen, aviator, here we are!
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all. Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you.
Good night. And I am very grateful to you.
Is that a fact?
Fire insurance!
You are asking to burn these people... you are asking?...
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
Well, what do you think I'm in this for? Think of it, man, a match a cigar stub and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
Not at all let me show you how easily it can be done.
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor A great sculptor. Look this forearm is at least two inches too long.
If it is freedom to represent people with limbs that don't match cripples you have achieved your purpose. Anatomy! Heaven forgive you. You must have studied with a sideshow of freaks!
But I have some friends waiting.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
All right, I'll tell them. They're right here in front.
Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Well, any time I can do anything for you
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in. Results taken. What if I didn't miss?
What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor? What then? What did your life mean? Who did you nurture, Pauly? Who did you love?
What was her name? The one I met.
Okay.
A place you've never been.
A quantum one.
How?
Like now?
Dysfunctional
And glow happily ever after.
What?
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
I said she isn't here. NOW you go home. Be a nice boy and go home.
I know, Mother.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
Sure. Let me take your suitcase.
But who were they?
In what sense were they bad?
Did they try to induce you to become a prostitute?
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
There was this old man that ate his niece.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
Buddy, you are in one of your evil moods, I don't want to talk to you. I'm going out and sweep the patio.
Well, all right.
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers... But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
Promise not to tell Doll? or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
I fell madly in love with him when he called me Rosebud. You know that first day when I come and he said I looked graceful like a capital letter S and called me Rosebud? I fell madly in love with that man right then. But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a good man and won't have nothin'to do with me.
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Actually, I am, though.
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
But I'm curious, Rose.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
Aw, be a good sport, Rose. You like me, don't you? I like you a lot.
' Course it does.
All right, that's enough. You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
Don't mention it.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit.'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin'such a nasty things a child your age!
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Buddy, you're just a child.
Well, nothin'.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
No. No, you're not hurting me. But I think you better quit it.
You wouldn't understand. Oh, God, I must be outta my mind. What would your Momma think?
I sure hope you don't. I gotta get outta here, good night.
Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as I've been please have pity on me and don't ruin me by telling them what I did. I know it was bad, it was bad and dumb. But mostly it was dumb, I didn't mean you no harm, I'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that's the truth. I love you. But they'd think I did, they'd think I was awful, they'd despise me and hate me...
Buddy, Mr. Right is out there somewhere and I'm gonna find him!
You're my sweetheart.
But I don't know who they are.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin'in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin'to my heart beat.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw'em, and a little bit he says to me, " You know, you are beautiful. " Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin'ideas.
Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!
Makin'homes for purple martins, huh? We had'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
Take a little walk with me, huh?
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Yep, we had'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin'to get rich raisin'rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
He thought he could sell'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat'em all up.
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin'nothin'but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
A saint just like your own mother. She's up in heaven right now, her and Lunette, there ain't no doubt about it.
I do, too.
I do, too!
Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
Reading dirty comic bocks. And you admitted it?
The girl strikes like a cobra.
What's taking the rascal so long?
He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son. Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose.
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him understand?
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
True, but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder. Now let's go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with.
And there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder to get up into Rose's bedroom in the dark of night! I am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! and that is not all I am going to do!
She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch there they were, naked and smiling at me! Rose, open this door immediately!
She talks a great deal and smiles a lot. She's very pretty, she has a real good figure. She's very girlish or womanish, if you know what I mean. She wouldn't hurt anybody, this girl. She couldn't.
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
Walked, in all that heat? It's a wonder she hasn't got sunstroke. I'll phone Daddy and you go get Doll Baby and Waski.
Oh, Brother, I am so disappointed in you. You mustn't look at those horrible things, they degrade the human image.
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
I said ahhh dam stuff.
Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh dam stuff.
What'd you say, Brother?
Oh, yes, it's Thursday. Hello, Rose, dear...... my, you're... looking pretty...
I'll be right back.
No, he doesn't. Not really.
Yeah.
Let's go peep from the living room.
I can't see, let me see...
He's trying to get up good God, one of her titties is out!
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
He kissed her.
He had his hand on her titty.
You know, Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.
So am I.
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
Dumbness doesn't concern her, Doll. And neither does smartness. You see
You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill you!
Buddy... does Rose really... " do it " with all those boys and men?
A baby... and she isn't even married.
If it isn't a baby... what is it?
How goes it, darlin'?
What do you think of her, honey?
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Um hmm. Almost too perfect.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.
All right, darlin'.
I'll take him with me downtown. And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
Who doesn't have such thoughts? We'd better get going.
Just half a cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality. Have a little patience with her. She's such a good hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much. In a perfectly proper way, of course.
Quarter of twelve.
I don't see any bruises or broken bones.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
I am not being brutal to her!
Darlin', it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics
Boys? You say to me boys?
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
I don't intend to mock you, dear. I respect your philosophy. It's beyond my comprehension, but I respect it.
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier than thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of. The girl has got to go, darlin'.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
He's a polecat, dear.
Sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit. Your real trouble is that you're anti intellectual. The irony is women are supposed to be emotional, but I never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do.
The hell we can't.
Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever.
I don't know how you can call it ideal don't you know what the word " farm " means to her?
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
She already told you, she doesn't know.
I forgot that Rose will lie like a child. She's no more pregnant than I am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
Better off? How could she ever find love and happiness, if you did what you're talking about? Are you insane?
I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning Brother, what are you doing up?
You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died.
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Yes, sir.
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
Calm down, Rose, let's calm down and discuss it...
Do you know what a friend you have got there? Do you know she would fight for you like a tiger, that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you? Is this any way to repay her trust and love? Are you ashamed as I am ashamed? Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But let me warn you, damn your hide, this is Thermopylae and I am standing here. Do you hear me, damn you. I am standing at Thermopylae and the Persians shall not pass! Now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes, and stop crying!
Is anything wrong?
Well, good night.
Yeah. I'm goin'out.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half a cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
You don't know where you're going?
Strange voices, Rose?
Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep. Those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house, and it wasn't Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.
I'm not hungry.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance. But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
Well, I don't know what happened. They were arguin'about baseball, then all of'em started fightin'. As for that policeman, I didn't bite him, I don't think I bit him.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
Yes, air.
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Well, it was a silly question.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Mmm. Would you get me another half a cup of coffee, dear?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Ahh hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor type job.
No, no, not exactly. It isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. Not at all. It's a... dairy establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful!
Your baby?
Good God almighty. This is a catastrophe, they won't hire her.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
Nothing, Rose.
I'm only trying to help him, Mother.
When he was baby we called him " Wa Wa, " a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
There are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty and that's all there is to it. Beauty is there and we have to recognize it. Now Rose, the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She looks like an angel and she is an angel, but she can be a naughty angel sometimes, although her father won't believe it. Her real name is Frances, but we call her Dolly or Doll.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
You're so sweet.
Well, you run on now.
You look sick if you ask me. I hate to leave you with the dishes and all, but I'm supposed to go to a meeting of the Garden Club this evening. I'll need the car keys.
I had better call Daddy.
No, Rose, he'll help you.
Oh hh, ohh hh, Lord, he's gonna kill me.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
Oh, I know. But I didn't, really. Honestly, I didn't. There was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin'address.
Forget about it, I don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.
And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right!
Every person's got their own kinks, beef cake. What's wrong, Kittle? You don't swing?
A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle candy you're chasing. It's up here...... in the old curiosity shop.
You think it's that good?
Well... what can I do? You've created a dilemma... And, look at the that. Time's running out. I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
A Lincoln? What Lincoln? Lincoln Continental? Lincoln Mark Five... Six...?
Am I supposed to take this information and sit up in the hills with a frickin'telescope?
Who cares?
Careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know! Convince me!
You don't. It's a gamble. But, not even in Vegas are you gonna get close to this kind of cash. This is two million, Archie. It's not three houses, it's twelve. It's dreams come true.
Abe Lincoln...
This scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the Mexican border high as a kite for the next two years. You think we're gonna let Zimmermann haul it onto our streets on the Fourth of fucking July!?
I don't know, okay? All I know is Butch Cassidy's back in town.
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank ville? I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
Nothing, I guess. Just an observation. She's really something special. You're a lucky fella.
What'd I say?
What, am I supposed to read it while I drive? Keep a grip on it, alright?
Give a Hoot. Don't Pollute.
Save it. Just go.
We'll share.
Get ready.
Move it!
We should slow down.
What are you, Henry friggin'Kissinger all the sudden?
You're just saying nothing! Tonight is the night.
What of it? Haven't we waited forever...? Haven't we, honey? Haven't we waited long enough to get this scumbag?
The ones you got in that fist fight with a couple a weeks ago...?
That's them trying to kill us.
Wh... what...?!
The booze.
Dean Martin.
What about him?
What day is it?
I'm not taking a cigarette break, jackass, just give me one!
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Birth control's important.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics. The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
Oh... okay.
It doesn't say that.
How come everyone thinks hitting me's the best way to get my attention?
No, we're stealing.
Then, why'd we tie him up?
Okay. It doesn't smell as bad in here as I remember it smelling.
Speak for yourself.
General Jim Beam, then.
Oh. Well. I think it's pretty common knowledge that in the Battle of Little Big Horn, Custer was drunk off his ass.
Bummer.
Look out! Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
Let me see that... Not bad.
You're the one with the star spangled hard on, not me.
You know what I mean.
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect. They couldn't go doing everything at once.
" Go, go, go! " " Slow down. " Make up your mind.
Can't be worse than you.
That's right, white bread. Give it up. Right now.
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
That's not true.
Chalk up another victory for Billy Boy's one man war on crime.
How'd we do?
Come again...?
Maybe it's enough.
It's just a question of how long do we have to slap you silly till you spill the beans.
Do tell.
I don't think so.
Good. Thought I was imagining them.
So are you, Pop Sweet. That's why...
Yeah? So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer? I'm a busy man.
Well, let me tell you how it is...
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
I can't do it, Ben.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
But I had to help my friends.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Jabba's palace.
Yes, my Master.
As you wish.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Yes, my Master.
Are you all right?
Wouldn't miss it.
The same as always.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Oh... great!
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
Yeah, sure.
I gotta get you out of here.
You love him, don't you?
I'm trying!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all powerful Sarlacc.
Proper?!
Oh, Artoo, hurry!
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
What do you remember?
Tell me.
Vader is here... now, on this moon.
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
Then you know why I have to face him.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
Because... there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
So, you have accepted the truth.
If that is your destiny.
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Oh well. How about you.
Ahhh no stop I mean Janet. Janet.
Like this. Like how? It's your fault you're to blame. I thought it was the real thing.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
He might be. I don't know.
So please don't tell me to can it.
I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet. I love you.
Janet
Yes.
Yes.
Uh huh.
Oh Brad.
Hmmm... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
Oh...
Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles? Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
I'm coming with you. Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Well I want to leave.
Then ask the butler or someone.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Brad I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
Weiss.
Oh, I hope so my darling. But let me switch on the light.
Oh don't be so shy.
I hope so my darling.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly. Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
You're wet.
I most certainly do. He happens to be an old friend of mine.
You're OK by me.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
You tricked me I wouldn't have I've never never
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.
" Transylvania "
Was all I had to say
Want to come again and stay
Smile and that will mean I may
Wheeling
Dealing
My high is low. I'm dressed up With no place to go.
No no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
No no no no.
Oh, lucky him.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
Ain't your fault Here's the problem.
Shell shocked!
I think mebbe we're early or somethin '
And you never got the chance?
I would say you're very shy by nature.
Some people think bein'shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
Then why did I bother bringin'it up?'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts I'm dumb an'you're shy.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya'almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
... I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin'is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin'after.
After a rough fight, ya'nothin'but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin'a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya'eyes hurt, ya'ears hurt, ya'hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an'never had a busted nose Bent an'twisted an'bitten but never broke... That's rare.
... Guess.
... Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an'the mountain I had to get rid of the mountain'cause they kept fallin'off.
I had it pulled. People callin'all the time. Who needs it Who'd you wanna call?
D'you really wanna call?
You sure?
Why?
I'll call your brother.
It's only temporary.
What's the problem? You don't like me Don't like the turtles What is it?
It's okay.
It's all right You're my guest.
They're all the same.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
But I'm willin'to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
The glasses... Please.

' Bout seven.

Really You don't think they're overly feminine?
Can't fool around You look very great.
Yeah... But I think weak legs ain't bad sometimes, y'know.
Don't be mad at him He just wants to help.
... Are you going to say anything to him?
What did you say about a pet shop?
Is everything all right?
... I can't beat him.
Yeah, I can't beat him.
... I dunno.
It ain't so bad,'cause I was a nothin'before
C'mon, it's true But that don't bother me I just wanna prove somethin'I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed. If I go them fifteen rounds, an'that bell rings an'I'm still standin', I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood...
No... I can't!
Paulie, please
... Like you?
I can't go out.

Even when I owned you in'66 you never had luck. But now I think you might be gettin'some luck kid. Whatta you think?
Mr. Balboa
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Rocky, would you be interested in
Excuse me.

Not spar, I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship.
... Screw you, yoyo.
What?
Don't you never say that You guys talk like that in front of a little girl You guys are scum.
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
Makes your breath like garbage.
' Cause that's the way guys are They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an'watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin'a whore.

Think about it.
Here's the card?
' Bout an hour ago.

I'm usta seein'ya at the gym, but seein'ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint.
What's happened is freak luck.

How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
Do you feel you have a chance?
Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.
Is this paper even good?
R. K. Maroon.
Bastards put him on notice.
It's all yours.
The rabbit's wife? Wanna tell me what she was doin'with her arms around you?
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Nope. It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
Got me. But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
Oh, no...
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Familiar. Be careful, Eddie.
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
Why would he contact me? I just took some lousy pictures.
Have you tried Walla Walla? Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
The other people who were in here lookin'for the will. I woulda caught'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
Oh, not that downtown. Toon town.
I ain't tellin'you nothin'! Get me Santino.
I've had enough of your insolence! Put him in my car. I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.
No one person is Cloverleaf. We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L. A. to Pasadena. Pasadena to Hollywood. Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non stop from one end of the L. A. Basin to another.
Not for long. We're retiring the Red Cars. People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to. And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
Not really. Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
Eddie? Jesus, what happened?
Boy, I'll say. They gave you a real Toon a Roo.
Does it hurt?
Uh, Eddie, do me a favor. Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
So what? He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin'I can wise the rabbit up with.
You don't have to. The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink  Paint Club. You can catch her in action there.
A hundred bucks? That's ridiculous.
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Yeah, but I enlarged this one. Thought you might be interested.
Maybe. Why?
Stop what?
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
You tricked me, damn you!
There's no time to take it easy! You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
No better?
Have patience!
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Tempt not a desperate man!
Why that pale hard hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
A challenge, on my life.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow boy's butt shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
By my heel, I care not.
Is the day so young?
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Out
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms! Feather of lead  Benvolio Snickers  Dost thou not laugh?
Good heart, at what?
Farewell, my cuz.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
' Tis he.
I'll not endure him.
Uncle,'tis a shame.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
Here comes your father, tell him so yourself.
O God! O Nurse, how shall this be prevented? What sayest thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort nurse.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
Goodnight.
 Within  Juliet!
 Within  Juliet!
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
I'faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother? '
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
I have.
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
What?
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims'hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers'kiss.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers'sake.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
You kiss by the book.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
 Aside  Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
I take thee at thy word.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say'Ay,'And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say'It lightens.'Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
What satisfaction canst thou have to night?
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
By the hour of nine.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away. O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
O God, I have an ill divining soul. Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. O fortune, fortune. Be fickle, fortune, for then I hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
And so did I.
That dreamers often lie.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies'midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate stone On the fore finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel nut Her wagoner a small grey coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers'brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers'fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she This is she!
True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew dropping south.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
Meaning, to court'sy.
A most courteous exposition.
Pink for flower.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Here's goodly gear!
' Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o'both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
A Plague o'both your houses.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.
I don't know.
Well I don't!
I don't know. I was thinking... Maybe the three of us might partner up guns for hire, that sort of thing.
The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
What is?
Best beer in the world? Budweiser for me, thanks.
Oh yeah? Whatta you drink, then?
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
Not to me, you know that.
Nothing.
From Interpol?
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
Once.
We weren't real thrilled about it either...
I still am.
That's right.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to. when I was a Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with. You know: any man who needed setting up. Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed. Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam. To most of the men I with I was always the girl. " Send the girl to do it. " " Tell The girl to take care of it. " " Have the girl fuck him. " But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
Exactly. And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
Just business.
That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
I'm a patriate.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself. And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
Bloody fucking hell...
I intend to. This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat a link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand. With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
I'd stake my reputation.
In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
Next.
Shut up!
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
We'll double your price.
Do you have the material?
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
He's company.
What do you mean?
What's that?
Of course.
Then you better find it in your heart to tell me, Francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be.
Whatever you wish... This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor. I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
What's a little hate between business partners?
I think not. I have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens. Unless, of course, I deactivate it before it goes off.
Bullshit!
Then where is it?
Sent it where?
A means to an end, is that it?
Then I guess we're set.
What's that?
Nobody's going to do that!
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
I do, I do...
All in the stomach, though. Your man might live.
Long enough to shoot back.
It's been known to happen.
I got a surprise for you, blondie...
Everybody.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry. You could stand to shed a few pounds.
Who you calling dumb, dickless?
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
Is that right?
Not in mine.
Who else would you be?
Things. This is my country, you know.
I can do that.
Something like that...
I didn't know that you spoke French.
Same thing, isn't it?
What's the difference?
A cigarette? As in one? One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Christ, I smoke a pack and a half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse. It's just so damned pleasurable.
There is that.
Exactly. Why not bring them?
Watch that one, he's an ex spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB. He's smart, Gregor is.
Deirdre? Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
I've wondered that myself. None of this answers my question, though... Why bring me?
Who am I?
They certainly are. Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
See what?
Well I ain't a cop.
That there was a gun pointed at me.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
You don't. You just learn to live with it.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I got a feeling you cost more than two bits.
It's Paris. The route's too indirect for anything else. A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now. He's going to Paris. Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
No... I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
Fix it yourself? Why are we even doing this? There's no need to run, Christ... You're a cop.
You're with Interpol you're a cop.
And what job is that?
I'm going with you.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
Yes I do.
Clearly.
Thorough man.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Then quit. You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
It's a cover, then. A cover within a cover, a feint within a feint. You work for the CIA, it's the only possible answer.
Dark operations. Wet work. Kidnaping. Assassination.
It is at that.
I never made that claim.
You were behind the door?
You would have done that?
How could you have done that?
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
You don't know? Bullshit, you had her, there was no way out.
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Something like that.
No you don't, and you know it.
In a minute.
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
Would you stop with that...
The mark of a true Samurai. What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do. We're both hired guns, and this is a job like any other job.
Because I don't walk away.
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto. Jean Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
And yet you would have killed him to save my life. You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore. I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with. All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
That's a good question.
No, I don't.
And now...
You speak French.
Nothing...
I know.
Tell me something first. The package: what was it?
What happened to it?
I guess that's for the best.
I'm sure.
It's the Irish tape we want.
You put everything on the line because you...
Doing well. This is?
Why don't we step into my office...
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
It's a matter of respect. Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long.
Shut up! Not another word out of you! You're going down, the Feds know all about it! You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
Don't lie to me!!!!
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end. Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
Oh, you would have done great.
That's what everyone thinks. But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin'environment in which to concentrate.
Shit, more than that.
I mean Earl grabs Booth's arm
We don't know whose money it is! They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
We don't know that.
Well someone's gonna find them.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
Who's going to question us? Dwayne? Jesse?
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
Because... I know.
That's right!
They killed themselves. Besides, they were breaking the law. What they were doing was wrong! Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?
Well, I don't know. I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too
Well neither have I, but it's us or him. If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in. Besides, he's a low life scumbag. His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Okay then. I'll do it.
Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene. You know what they'd do.
Well we didn't kill him, he died on his own.
Forget it. We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down. And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it. Understand?
This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
No we didn't. He died on his own.
It's the right thing to do.
I don't know...
I can't do that.
He would have done it to us, right?
Well I'm not! Thinks he's got us by the balls.
And how do you figure we do that?
He's probably made copies. He's not going to give them up to us.
Neither do I.
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
Well what are we supposed to do?
Not bad enough to kill him.
It's gonna be o. k.
You don't know if he was really gonna
Do you have everything?
I don't know. They got all kinds of high tech shit nowadays.
No we're not.
We've got to go now, then.
Then Sally comes too.
What happened? What's Earl doing here?
Booth, listen to me... Booth!
What do you mean? Look. We can make still make it work.
Yes it is. I'm calling it in. Right now.
And you're solid on that?
My point, well...
My offer? Well I'd say it's a fair one, like I said we're friends. All I want is my share, which I guess is...
I'm all ears.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think... two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
By Friday.
I want my share. All of it.
Well I don't know what's going to happen next she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
I'm not gonna take I'm not gonna take it in stride. I had a good run turn to shit on me like that cleaned me out.
You're only screwing yourselves over! Helllllp! HELLLLLP! SOMEBODY!!!
HELLLLLP!!!!
What are you doing, Earl?
Because someone may have gotten away.
Yes. Wife and a kid. Don't blame yourself, Deputy. You did all you could. You have our deepest gratitude... and my personal thanks.
Denning was wearing a bug.
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
No. But he would, probably.
Heard you had quite a night.
I know.
Nothing's wrong.
OK.
Yeah I'm fine.
OK. I love you.
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well. It's over.
That son of a bitch.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways. Let's forget it. I'll just be a little more careful next time.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
It doesn't matter... he's next to you. You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
We'd... I don't know... go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
I love you.
I don't know, Booth.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
Sally there's a whole world out there. We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin plated dump. What are you giving up?
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Yeah, it is...
I swear to you, it's true...
I don't remember. We get a lot of people in here.
Thanks for your time.
Sounds like you don't trust me.
You said that, I didn't.
I have a better plan.
What?
Speaking of which that reminds me I have to bring something home or eat Sally's meatloaf again, and I don't think I could stand that.
Yeah. I told him I'd be there before five.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously.
Mm hmm...
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything. If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Dwayne... It is imperative that we keep this confidential. Now we know someone's out there. Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Not exactly. It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
No. But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I  m a busy man.
Why?
About what?
Uh, sure. I hear you.
I'll do my best... that doesn't give me much time.
Yeah... see you at three.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
Where's the hot back the therapeutic pad thing?
Forget it.
Watch that. Watch that tone.
That hasn't stopped you before.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner.
It certainly is...
Shut up!!! Slut!!!
You'd do this to me!
True, but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl?
Just do it! Meet me there, now.
Listen
Oh Jesus Christ...
Well you can't have it.
I think I am.
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
Money.
Not in the trunk.
Yeah, we did. It was unleaded, high octane.
I don't know how else you'd explain it. The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
We're doing a check on the manufacturers'serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch. What's your take on these local boys? Are they providing any answers?
You think he skipped town?
Not getting an answer? For Christ's sake! Call 911! Let's get it locked down here!
I got my sources.
James, you see my kids back there? You know how much I'm paying for private school? How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
Jail!? James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
How'd you know?
So tell me what you know.
Yeah. We already been there. This is big, Kenny. Benjamins. Secret Service calls'em superbills. Banks can't even tell the difference.
San Juan! You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles. But hey, I understand. Make yourself at home, Isabella. Champagne, caviar, whatever you want. My ship is your ship.
That's right. I'm the owner, the Captain you can call me El Capitan.
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella. I like you. I can see myself with you in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
Called? What's my ship called? Well... it's called the S. S. Minnow Johnson.
Red Dragon? You sure about that?
Your friend's ship? Oh, man. I must've walked onto the wrong yacht. I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
How're they getting into the U. S. Mint to use the presses?
The real question is, where are the plates? If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend. Enjoying your visit?
That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.
You bring American money?
You pick any girl for you and your friend.
She is nice. But I am very tense. I'm gonna need a lot of massages. I'll take that one, too. How you doin', baby? And... that one in pink. She can do my feet.
Did you see the way those girls drove off? I did you a favor.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
I said that? Which word was " goat? "
Mu shu? You're hungry?
Carter, would I lie to you?
You better take one. Your breath has been a little funky all day. Let me look at you.
Take this. It's a Magnum. You can fold it in half.
Bathroom.
I'm sorry.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is. We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
Carter, you don't understand. These men are Fu Cang Long Triads. Part of the most deadly gang in China.
No. You are a civilian. In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
Shit. C'mon, get up here and help me out.
You're sorry. I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry. Just take me home.
My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
Well, hurry up.
That's Ricky Tan? He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
I'm a dangerous man. You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
Fine. Go home. Who needs you.
Stop! I'm sick of your bullshit!
It's my job!
I have plenty of dates.
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
You.
Not Yu. You!
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
Why the hell should you believe him? He had us beat up. Naked. That's nasty shit.
What the hell is going on here?
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
You're not very good at this, are you?
Forget it.
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved. Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
I know. I know. I am sorry.
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal. Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
But if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.
I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
Follow the Rich White Man?
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Who?
How do you know he's our man?
You sound like that all the time.
Maybe. But not like Asians. We never panic.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
He'll be back soon.
Look at her. Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu shu in six months.
My fiancee left me over the summer a month before our wedding.
It's a long story.
No. It was my singing.
She hated my voice. Said it drove her crazy. I sang to her all the time in bed in the shower I thought she liked it. She finally told me it was driving her crazy.
I'll try to stay awake. It's so boring.
Nothing. I said nothing.
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice. You want some ice?
No. It's not right.
I don't want to hear this.
Snoopy? I love Snoopy.
She's reaching into her panties something is strapped to her leg. Oh, God... please don't let it be a dick.
No, I don't believe this shit it's a microphone. Lee, she's wired...
I don't need a turn!
Get it out of here!
They don't know that. What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview? I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings. You saw the way she was staring at me.
You're just jealous'cos the girl picked me. I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
Snoopy is about six inches taller than you. I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.
She saved our lives.
I'm about to be killed and you " Shhh " me! This wasn't my case, Lee. Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu Cang Long are not in South Central. I didn't have to help you.
It doesn't matter.
Well we're not friends.
Fine with me.
See you in the next world.
Fine.
Yes. We have heaven.
What's a Chinese heaven?
I think we should stop talking.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
How was the sex?
You're kidding. No sex? Nothing? No mu shu?
What about a little king pao chicken?
Steamed dumplings?
That's rough, man. If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Are you serious?
That depends. How do the Fu Cang Long usually kill their victims?
Go ahead. Sing your ass off.
I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
Now that I believe.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
You could never kick my ass. You mama's boy.
What is Mac out?
Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia.
Dancing? I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo. Did she have a friend?
Wait a second. There's guards all over the place. You'll need a distraction.
I'll give it my best shot.
No you didn't!
We have to get to the Penthouse.
Just GO!
I'm this way. I guess this is goodbye.
You take care of yourself, Lee.
No, Carter. I can't take this.
Come on, Lee. Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up. There must be something you want.
First class.
A little Mu shu.
Yes. They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
Look over there. That's the eye in the sky room.
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
Dip me!
No. Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid cause he was always quacking. Never shut up.
Nobody can protect me. I'll make a deal with you, Lee. But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
I don't think it's over. There are casinos all over this country. Let me make you a rich man, Lee. Don't make the same mistake he did.
No. Your father. Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
It's a massage parlor downtown. " Heaven on Earth. " You will find your answers there.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
That's probably the only reason Johnson's still alive.
I got a call from the F. B. I. The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it.
I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch! Your ass is goin'to jail!
He was just doing his job.
Beach Boy America. Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my
Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns. That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.
Bullshit a little. You lied to me.
It's the same thing!
You're full of shit. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
Yeah, that's right. Now that we understand each other... show me how you did that.
That silly ass look on your face.
Well don't do that. Polite don't work here. You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment.
Wait. You hungry? You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right? Then you gotta be hungry. Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry. We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.
Right....
Let me just clarify a few things. I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America. Without me you are just another tourist.
Shortcut?
The license! You get it?!
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L. A. after what? Six hours?
Bullshit! You were trying'to lose my ass again.
No. I just made it up.
I could not come. I had other responsibilities.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
What?
Yeah, somethin'like that. OK, now this is a nasty ass place. When you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. You got to maintain control. You following me? You lose it, you get hurt. Now, you're my responsibility and I don't want you hurt. You understand? OK, let's go.
It happens.
Are you tellin'me nobody knows what he looks like? Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
That one is my favorite. Chicken puff with shark fin.
You know War?
No, no. It's not good God you all! It's Good God, ya'll. Ya'll!
No! You hate me. Look, I'm gonna do it one time. That's it.
Excuse me?
What do you hear?
No, like a tourist. You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.
I'm sorry.
The art.
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo. My country asked for the best. I told them that was you. Now I will show you around my  hood.
Oh, I think you like this very much.
Oh, baby, you cruel...
FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.
I could get promoted right out of here.
I wouldn't be close to you. What is that perfume, girl?
In Charge. Just me'n him. No interference. They don't even want to hear from us until we're done. I love the F. B. I. I love the F. B. I.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find  em.
It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin'with that on?
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Not to me. Never to me.
How much they want?
Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
He is the situation.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is. He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.
No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.
What?!
He is very good.
He is already on the plane. I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
And Mr. Lee? Where is he?
You don't understand this guy.
I'm not running.
I've got news for you. No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
Got any last minute advice?
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
It happens to be how I feel.
Of course.
Of course.
We'll rub.
" Sink the putt. "
" Nothing but net. "
So? I never returned your calls, even when we were married. And what's Fisher doing here anyway?
Journalism lesson number one. If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
I didn't cook up a story. I had a source.
See? You want custody of my job?... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Or a vegetarian?
Poor Ike.
All the gory details.
This is good. It is a good story, Fish.
Then you've got it. If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
Justice, yes. Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
No, I'm paying for the dress. Do you think she's still gonna run?
Yeah.
Okay, we'll order out.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
I just found out I'm best man! I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?
Thanks.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Guess you'd know about that. You're an entomologist, right? How's business?
Neuter a locust, feed the world.
Why do YOU think she ran?
No. I call it like I see it. I'm a journalist. I'm a truth teller.
Oh, please!
About her upcoming wedding and all.
Yep. Maggie Someone to see you.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all stars in high school, you know.
You know, your daughter seems...
Excellent.
You're going to be very disappointed.
I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work. I still have my job.
Really?
Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
You've seen the post its. I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Five hundred.
Done.
Maybe someday.
No, I'm not afraid. Just... Maybe someday.
What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
What do you mean? It was incredibly romantic!
No. I think I said something eloquent like, " So, uh maybe we should, ya know. What do you think? "
No.
Bob will be very happy.
What was that? I can't order my eggs without sarcasm?
It's valuable. Hang onto it.
First I have to find some tools. I need a half and a nine six tenth.
Wrenches. My dad's gonna love that one.
Are you all right with this? You think this is funny?
I don't and I don't think you should...
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing. It's the theme of this party.
Well, they should. Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
That was very interesting research George was doing!
I already explained about that.
Brian told you that?
Every one of those times I was being supportive. Something you won't understand.
Lost!
What!?
That's called changing your mind.
Yes I do!
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect. Hey.
Really?
Me, either.
And the church.
I'm okay with that.
So, we'll...
Yes, I did.
This is getting serious.
I'm listening.
Stop it. When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Ya think?
Over there. Ten o'clock. He's talking to our little Dennis. Dennis will turn into one of those " sources say " things.
Yes.
Because you think I'm all like... " Hey man, check me out ".
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
But I'm weird.
Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up. Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
Something that brings warmth to my heart. Duckbill platypus.
This party is for you and Bob. Get your mind off the reporter.
Would it?
What happened at the luau?
It's for the bell.
You and your lucky geese. You always see geese.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
Okay.
Thank you. You still think that he was....
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
A harmless joke.
Nope.
Nope.
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
I hate boats.
Boats. You go out in them. You come back in them. I hate them.
Boats. All anyone talks about is the wind. Is it up, is it down. I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
But it's on the water.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to... Betsy
Am I what they had in mind?
I love you, Walter. Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Even when you were young?
I'll wait.
We'll stay at the Plaza
Go to the Symphony
It's delicious, trust me.
I don't think so.
I know. It makes no sense at all. Thank God my life is in place.
When you get back, I'll be gone
Okay, okay.
I am. I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous. It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
About forever.
Well, I did. And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
I do.
It's so beautiful. It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from. You see what I mean. There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them. Surprises are highly overrated.
Yes. But it wasn't really. It was just...
I told you. Nothing
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building. I'm here.
Look!
Whatever it is.
What's with you?
And now 2, 000 women want his number. The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
... movie. That's your problem. You don't want to be in love. You want to be in love in a movie. Read it to me.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store
You are. You're losing your mind. What about Walter?
Right.
What?
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
He lost all the weight... there.
Can too.
Yes.
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
What?
Definitely.
Okay. Good. Goodbye.
What?
No. That's the weirdest part about it.
I love you, too.
I love that dream.
But he saw you, right?
" Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter. It was great. We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M. F. E. O. Sleepless in Seattle. "
Made for each other.
What about the letter?
What are your plans in New York?
I love the symphony.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like cosmically wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting... however long it was.
Go home for the weekend.
Howard.
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
I don't even know him. But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
I know, I know. I do not want to move to Seattle. But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think? It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
Thank you, Tom. I feel so much better just having blown this off.
I notice these things are back in fashion. Oh, honey. He's a lovely man, Annie.
Are his folks nice?
How did it happen?
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
Oh, please. Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
It wasn't a sign. It was a coincidence.
You know.
Magic. It was magic.
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter. It's quite a formal name, isn't it? One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time... in the sack I believe you call it
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while
Well, fine, fine. Fiddle da dee. And how's it working?
You don't believe in signs.
Magic.
Shhhh
The one in the street. I chased after you.
Grace the dispatcher. Great.
Why me? What about Jay?
No.
It is not
And that's what I'm trying to tell you. What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
Everywhere. You can't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute. Who the first babe to say this was I don't know, but it caught on.
Well. Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck. This can go on for years. Then you have tests. Then you get to do it with a condom. The good news is, split the check.
Great. They'll have a parade in your honor. You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine. Tira misu.
You'll find out.
You'll see.
You'll like it.
It's Y. O. H.
Your only hope.
You have to go to her, Jonah. You have to find her.
Eighty dollars.
But how am I going to get there?
Do you want a fruit plate?
I'd rather die than eat on an airplane. I'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything.
There's somebody on the phone for you. His name is Sam.
We desperately need a spice rack. Desperately.
Right.
What?!
You're right. You better hope so.
No, I'm not, but
Dad
What?
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J? I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah. What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
Sure. Looking good.
I think I know how to have a spice rack.
Right. I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
This is no good. She's looking for someone French. Or Greek. " Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa. " Where is that?
Somewhere in the middle.
She's willing to fly anywhere.
This is not how you do it. You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean. I wonder if it still works this way.
I'm starting to notice that.
Will she scratch up your back?
Jed's got cables.
Dad, this is amazing. If you play this backwards, it says " Paul is dead. "
How do you know?
Our house. There was water coming in all the windows.
Bye bye blackbird.
I miss her. What do you think happens to someone after they die?
Like do you believe in heaven?
I'm starting to forget her.
This is a good letter, Dad.
Her name is Annie. Annie Reed.
Just this one part, okay? " I have been an excellent third baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me "
WAIT!!! " and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore. " Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
It's a sign.
Perfect. We'll be there.
Jonah!
Thank Victoria for dinner.
I'm glad you liked it. Good night, Jonah.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
That's true. Why is that?
Everyone at work heard you.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
This is not a joke. Thank God Victoria doesn't know. It would really have hurt her feelings.
I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
The one who wrote us.
Yes.
What's wrong with Annie?
You said we could go to New York.
Did too.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
No.
When I found you?
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
What about camping?
Do you like it?
We ought to start camping again, Dad.
I think they're announcing your flight.
Yes?
Well, here's the number. If you ever find yourself Sleepless, give us a call. We also... do babysitting.
I'm sorry
You're kidding
" An Affair To Remember. " Did you ever see it? Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. Before that it was called " Love Affair With Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer. "
Look, I met somebody. She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off. We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to
No way. No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after... There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
Oh.
I've already solved it. I've hired a hit man.
Absolutely. Right.
I read an article about this...
It takes time
Sure. Sure.
Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
You're welcome to one.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
Well, those new fellows you hired from out of town we brought'em up here in a truck this morning, but they took one look at that picket line and turned tail.
Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
You haven't tried locking them up!
No, just the ring leaders. The fire eaters. And the ones with big families... Barton where's that boy?
No, no, it's the president of the company himself come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?
Question, question the problem, what to do about'em.
He says give'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
You know... What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
Super's busy with your Negotiatin'Committee.
Who? A scab?
You're a liar, Pancho. A no good, dirty...
Are you sad? Are we going to church? For your confession?
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Do you think I like living this way? What do you want of me?!
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
The safety of the men that's more important! Five accidents this week all because of speed up. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Aaah, what's the use?
No, no...
Forgive me... for saying you never thought of me.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
You are no good to me in jail.
Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
But the motion passed. It's... it's not democratic of you to...
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
NO, she wants to be there. And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
Backward.
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
Four nights. How did you sleep?
A meeting?
That meeting only lasted ten minutes. The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
No. We can't can't go on this way. We can't go back to the old way either.
When?
Alone?
Ram  n you can't.
But you are needed. Especially now with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand by squad.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
You mean you're ready to give up?
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says...
Charley's my friend. I need friends. Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. " Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican " that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, " Stay in your place. " Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
And if you can't understand this you're a fool because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
This means they've given up trying to break the picket line. Now we can all fight together all of us.
Or why don't you just put a sign outside? " No dogs or women allowed! "
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Because most of us here are Mexican Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners the same pay, the same conditions.
Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
You know I don't think that.
No. New York.
No...
Well, if that's possible...
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
Forgot what?
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
But Papa you need all the help you can get.
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the...
Ram  n... listen to me... I'm in a jam... I had to get a job...
Ram  n listen my kids...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town... just let me go.
You lump them all together Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
Are you Australian?
Good. I fucking hate Australians.
You mind?
What can I do for you?

They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
No, Why?
Who wouldn't?
It's downright classy is what it is.
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
I'll have to live with that. My money my risk, my rules.
Yeah.
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
That bad, huh?
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Go ahead.
It's not that easy.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers? I hate the son of a bitch.
I can't.
You don't understand.
I can't leave.
Fuck you.
Because he'll kill me.
That's long enough to get out of town.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel toed boots. Go figure. By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set. Where's Quincey?
How far out of town?
Just a fucked up guy who played beautiful music.
Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked up part.
It's the only way to play.
What do you want from me, Colette?
It gets me through the day.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
How much time do you have?
How much time do you have?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
What are you hiding, Danny?
I'm kind of busy.
I need my paycheck.
He knows where I work.
I been that way ever since.
Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
I don't want to.
Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
Your daughter needs you. Go.
These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer.
Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive.
Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help.
Is that what you want me to do? Put it all on Jesus? Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
Maybe I am dealing with it.
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred. Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her. Do you know what that feels like?
How?
Midnight?
Lead the way.
Jimmy. Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
My features. They're Finnish.
Finland is a country.
Was. I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man. You got anything for me?
Why does it have to feel so bad?
I guess there's just no substitute for good genes.
See that? That's just what I'm talking about.
Don't get carried away.
I know a buyer. Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
I think so. I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
Sure.
Yeah, that's what I mean. Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
Why do they call him Pooh Bear?
You're going to have to explain that one.
You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy.
What does J. F. K. stand for?
Was he the president?
Thanks for not laughing at me.
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me.
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
You don't trust me?
And you want me to do you some big favor?
You never did like me much, did you Verne? And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you?
You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose. Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
No shit? Fuck it. I'll send it to Oliver Stone then. He'll get them to reopen the bastard.
The good stuff. Can you handle that?
I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
I don't know, 14, 000 a kilo?
Okay... How about um.. 6, 000 a ounce.
But I just met you.
Pooh Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously.
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low ball me like some slick used car salesman.
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
I'm sorry?
Uh uh uh...
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five 0?
This is bullshit. You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.
What?
No last name?
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
Tell that to Bobby... and his wife and kid.
Soon. I promise. We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear. In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
I was trying to score some dope.
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
Bubba.
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande...
No. You just handed us a new one. We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute  250, 000 worth of crank. What's the mandatory on that, Al?
You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers. As least that's what the word is.
That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get rich quick scheme.
Who is it?
I thought you'd be happy.
Dude is bugging. Transparent spiders, plastic men the whole nine yards.
Turns out he's connected.
The Mexicali Boys
And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
He's the only one I told.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
No. You've got me all wrong. I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
Why doesn't Palmdale P. D. just raid the guy?
We're coordinating with Palmdale P. D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
I was talking about Miles.
Really?
No. Right here on the beach. Come on. Let's do it.
You mean like the Donner Party?
Tom, quit fucking around.
Look at that place. It's creepy.
Just no pleasing you, is there?
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There. You happy?
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician. You have every right.
Better than drugs.
I just want to be straight on the details. Can I taste it?
As a matter of fact, I am.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty one stretch Hudson with a big ole'trailer.
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
We got us a tent, forty two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred and ten foldin'chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all'a Hasset County and most'a Weller County. I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin'said ministry.
Yep.
Not where I come from.
You take account of the wind?
Hell, no. I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.
You know what a B. A. R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo. And you think these things are comfortable? They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty six pounds, right there.
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of. Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
The hell he didn't.
Hell, no!
I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole'coon you ever did hear,'a rustlin'right there in front of me. That ole'boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole'coon, go on, now, you get out'a here. Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a'that mash whiskey.
I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.
Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources. Miller Go on.
Wade?
My guess, too.
Who's Wade?
Sir, I understand. I don't like it, but I understand.
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley. It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field. The garage windows face left field. The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them. The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens. Two hundred twenty two yards from home plate to my garage windows. It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far. I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship. I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
It's worth it.
DASHES across the street.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
Sarge?
I've been humming it.
It seemed appropriate.
Some.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
The men said, nine.
That only leaves three.
Would they notice and eighty eight?
The Germans do.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
That's better, but you've still got a long way to go. Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.
Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
You? Leading a squad?
What about the company?
Simpson? Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
Beasley's dead.
Fresh out.
Twenty minutes ago. Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one. You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport.
Somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the Hundred and First's radios the night before the drop, not one of them works. We're going in blind.
Yep, hell of a mission.
Uh, Captain...
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
You got me. Afraid of bad news?
Good news?
And what about you?
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
You never know.
Yup, hell of a mission.
No. It comes and goes. It stops when I look at it.
I'll be alright.
How about you take your position?
Hesitates. Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack. Finds the morphine.
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother. Have I ever told you about her?
She's the best poker player you ever saw. My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt. Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost. She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands. And he bluffs? He had sixteen levels of bullshit. Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master. She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it. That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
No problem. A pair of deuces? Less? So what? I bluff. It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do? Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do? Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier. Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
Oh, yeah?
And how do you bluff yourself?
Except this time, the mission IS a man.
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
You want me to take over?
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.
What are we going to do?
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Sorry, I need a B. A. R. man, you're the best.
Trust me, you're the best.
Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf. Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off? And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for? Cheese. The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France. There is no bright side.
I'm listening, sir.
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one? What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Huh?
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir. It's a personal thing.
Easy for you to say, sir. Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck.
But I am a captain. If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...
I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.
Well now I'm saying we're moving out. Get off your ass.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A: Ryan is alive. We have to take him back to the beach. Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
B: Ryan is dead. He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention. There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea. We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
Neither do I, sir. C: And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded. Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
Maybe. But what if he dies on the way back? you see what I'm saying, sir? The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog tags and high tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
No, sir.
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.
FIRES a burst. Germans drops.
This bridge cannot be held. The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here. They have tanks.
Upham? Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Sarge? He was the best friend I ever had. Lemme tell you about Sarge...
No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
You want unpleasant? Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
Frogs?
Yeah? So?
Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
Freaked out. Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter. Can't.
Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty two flat.
Pardon me?
What's the profile?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
How can you, how can you say that?
No, no he's not.
No, I'm not married. It's for my daughter.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
I'll take the whole set.
Okay, thanks.
Yeah, I don't want it. Um, thank you very much. You're very kind.
I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had ? , and Jason had a sore throat. Your big graduation, and no one was there.
Hey, bad throat, huh J man?
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
Gee, it's easy.
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
I still am.
I'll be home soon.
But you never had a first date.
That's not even a scam.
Going out as friends.
Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you. She's a brain.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
C'mon, just do it.
Please?
Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
Yes.
See you. Bye. Bye Diane.
So, what's your point?
I already did.
The world is full of guys. Be a man. Don't be a guy.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook? Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, " You're a real live wire, Love Mr Carroll. " Y'know, it's all so phoney.
Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word'love', I look for a new word.
Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.
You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
Wait a minute.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants.
Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
What is wrong with this girl?
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
You like it?
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
Oh god, I don't need all these presents. I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...
No, wait a minute. Everybody thinks you're what?
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss. It's all working out for you honey, don't you see? It's all working out, just like we planned. All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
I'm sorry.
I love you too honey.
Tell me, is it bad news?
Are you kidding? You're not kidding? You're not kidding!
I won?
Wait a minute. How was Lloyd?
Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.
Now why can't I tell the story?
Crash paranoia.
Which they did. Let me finish.
So anyway, these two federal marshals meet the plane, and they take our address, and they ask us never to fly with'Friendly Skies'again.
You should be.
You bet you should have called. You still live at home. Don't make me call the police at three thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
You've always called before, always. Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
Do you wanna make things easier on me? Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit. You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
Sit down.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
It doesn't feel right to me. I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
You're not listening to me.
Dad, why are you acting this way? Is this because of the other morning?
Well listen to me. Now, I know you like him, I know he's nothing like those frat kids you can't stand, but honey, after the excitement wears off, then what, huh? What are you going to talk about? What do you have in common? You're going to be part of an international think tank, and he's going to be kicking punching bags.
Dad, you and I have talked about this. Lloyd and I have talked about this. Believe me, this is well covered territory.
Dad, I love him.
Sweetheart, no. Don't be ridiculous.
Honey!
I swear to god.
Honey, it's not what you think.
Honey, about what?
You think you know what this money is?
No, you don't know what it is. It's not for me. This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again. Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do. I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
I made their lives better.
Alright, alright. Go ahead. When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
Why are you being so hateful to me? Is this because of Lloyd?
That's right, work it out.
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
Don't say that, it's not good for you. You're...
I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
This is me telling you about me.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
You will?
Yeah. I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Yeah. I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah.
Quick question do you know who I am?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You remember?
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out. Do you wanna go out?
Busy?
Are you busy on Friday?
Are you busy on Saturday?
So you're monumentally busy?
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Look Diane, I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to leave the country without going to Valhere's graduation party. This gentleman, he's twenty two, and he comes out of hiding once a year for this occasion, and he dresses up as the Lakeside rooster, and he,
I'll go.
I'll go.
Eight. Eight O'clock.
Goodbye.
Yeah
Oh. Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
So it's an honor?
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
Yeah. I'm so glad we did this.
Sure I do.
Watch out for that glass.
You know what?
You're a great date. I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
So what's your job this summer?
No, I'm serious.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Then call me tomorrow.
Then call me later.
I think you should wear that.
Mmmm.
Won't you see me later?
Me? Sure I do.
Well, except for one thing. I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat. And they just jammed their mouths, you know? The used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me. You get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers
Okay, bye.
She's amazing. She's ninety three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
Well... just meet her.
No.
Don't worry about it. We're just having coffee. We'll be anti social.
Yeah. With potential.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right. Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Yeah. Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Yeah, a little bit. Listen, this is important. When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Now, go into second. Little more gas... Yeah! You can get this whole problem. Now, maybe you downshift to first?
Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson.
No.
I don't think so.
I don't think I am.
I don't know. I'm happy.
It did?
Why didn't you tell me?
I've never sent a letter like that, you know? I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know,'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
How do you know what I'm going to say?
I was just going to tell you that I love you. I said it.
What? This is a good level, isn't it?
Say what?
Well, I need to study, and...
Yeah.
We'll see.
Yeah, uh huh.
' Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
It sounded like you did.
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
I feel like a dick. You must think I'm a dick.
Yeah you do.
You shared it with a dick.
Is this because of your dad?
Did you talk to Corey?
She figured it out. I'm sorry if that upsets you.
Did you tell anybody?
You told your dad?
What, I'm sorry I said that. Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
What is that? What are you doing with your hands? Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
Then don't do it.
What do you want?
You do?
Hurt me again? Not a chance, don't worry about it.
What?
One more time would be nice.
Okay.
Good to know.
Okay.
Not right now, thanks.
No. You just described every great success story. Alright, it's alright.
Hey man, I was in love once. I got hurt really bad. I never wanna go through that again.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
The guy with the Datsun?
The truck?
What?
Yeah, she is. Good luck.
Jim Court... no, this is her father. I'll take...
Hello. Heard about that graduation present. Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't'have to retain me, but you can trust me. I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back. I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink. Kickboxing. You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future? Don'The Dragon'Wilson, Lenny ?  merciless, one of the champions of the sport? I can see by your face, no. My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
How ya doing? Is she around?
Well, we pay for the ? . That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.
Seriously, Lloyd.
No, really.
I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something. I'm going to give you another chance. Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening. Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
Am I going? Am I going to England? I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right? What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy? There's no way.
I know.
I know
I know. But then I reconsidered.'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter. I'm good at it.
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir. Are you alright sir? Are you okay?
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
Just her name.
Stop freaking with her head man. Just stop playing with her mind, you know? She's a human being. She's a person. She's very talented, you know.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Mike Cameron. This is one fresh jam, huh?
Yeah, hey, oh god. Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
Yeah, but how come it worked? I mean like, what are you?
This is great, this gives me hope. Thanks.
I don't really know where we are.
Wow, man. Well. Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster.
I was gonna...
I was just going to kind of move around.
I don't know. Good on you man. Alright Lloyd.
Diane, everybody loves that you showed up.
I love you man.
We're full on bonded.
He is.
I'm talking to a clerk.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
What
You would, though. That's what I'm saying.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
Breslau? I can't go to Breslau. Not now.
They're mine!
It's bad business.
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude. That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them. It's always something.
When?
Oh, this is " good business " in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia it doesn't make any sense.
You're not telling me something.
Yeah, sure.
You did, but you didn't.
How do you do?
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
It kind of looks that way.
Pistols, rifles, carbines... I'd be grateful.
What others?
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though has he ever once shown you his appreciation? I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy. Never a thank you note. He forgets my wife at Christmas time
Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product. They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
But it's less. It's less than what I would pay a Pole. That's the point I'm trying to make. Poles cost more.
Better this month than last?
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
Ah, yes.
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
It's dangerous. It's dangerous, to me, personally.
I'll admit it's a weakness. I don't think he enjoys it. All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
Well, I'll talk to somebody. I'll take care of it.
Well, sure. So would I. So would you. I wouldn't worry about it. We'll get it right one of these days.
You'll lose money.
I didn't do enough.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
No.
I thought you were going to the mixer?
Just some asshole trying to scare me.
I don't think that's a good idea.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
I did that.
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life how do I apologize for that?
Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
It helped me realize one thing.
You're a self obsessed little cunt like your mother.
Not until you  re dead.
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
Definitely Whitney.
Where's Sid?
No way.
You freakin?
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise.
That  s quick.
And watch her til 8: 00 I've got to edit.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
Randy somebody.
He hates Oliver Stone.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
You  re the one who got away.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
And now, drum roll please...
.. so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
So we found a compromise.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
Page 32. " Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim witted Barney Fifish presence. " I think you've explained yourself.
No, what you are is a money hungry, fame seeking liar and forgive me for saying mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
I never meant to imply...
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
Yeah?
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
Billy had alibis too.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
That's not the way it's done.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
We'd break some furniture.
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Hallie?
Oh my God. How could it happen?
It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo happy existence.
Humor me, Sid.
I'm sorry.
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
It's good to see you involved.
Yes, goddammit!
I don  t know.
The safety what? Fuck that!
Too bad.
" And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will always love you. "
What about rehearsal?
I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu drama?
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.
It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive slightly off white males in their twenties.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
.. it's really about family and tradition...
I just love being a sister.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
Now.
I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
You are so not funny.
You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
Sandra started without us. We can stay. He kisses her again, then breaks away.
What are you talking about?
Do you work for her now?
Me, too. Randy. Me too.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
I gotta coupla of those buttons myself.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p. o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
Who is this?
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Uh huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
Asshole, Can't talk.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
What kind of a game?
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
What?!
No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
Reaction to what?
Nope.
Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will.
What?
Follow me.
No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife. These two lethal weapons.
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Where are you Dewey?
Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
Show him.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Why would the police come to you?
What about me?
So it's off to London for a week? New York for a month? L. A Forever?
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
You used to say that was our strength.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
Off the record.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with'Stab 3'. She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
The boys said no. She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
I already removed it. I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
What part of'Off the record'don't you understand?
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
I'm on duty.
You're not a detective.
Gale, your engine's still running.
GALE BEHIND YOU!
Has anyone else every used your phone?
I work better alone. Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
I remember her! She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?
When we did the first'Stab " I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone. Can you imagine the press?
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Honestly, my life.
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.
I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
Being Gale Weathers. What the hell are you doing?
Here's how I see it. I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked. Because someone wants to kill me? No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go. That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you. Make sense?
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
That's funny.
No really?
Possibly.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Bitch.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Just because you knew her?
I don't think so! Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
Are you saying she was
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I'm here, drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself! Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should Have a look at your break line. That your car over there?
I know!
GALE WATCHOUT!
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there, She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything. We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good bye.
Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your music video awards.
You're not happy with your part.
Um hmm... umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Hello.
Who's this?
Why don't we just read the scene? Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
But you know my favorite name?
It's Sarah.
It is in my script.
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
My movie.
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
No.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast wise. And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
The question isn't who I am. The question is, who's with me.
Go there.
Are real? How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
WHERE?
I thought you wanted me here?
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Uh huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
No I need to call you. Just you.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney? Are you listening to me, huh?
It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT!
Sorry.
Sorry.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
Duh... that's quick.
Because I'm trying to build your self esteem. You're far too sensitive.
And if you get it right you die.
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
What are you doing here?
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid " R " rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
He's here. He's trying to kill me...
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
You know that's not true.
No...
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
But you're right enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
What?
Yeah... I think so.
When you're arrested you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Uh huh.
No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
We already played that game. You lost, remember?
Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
Who are you trying to reach?
What number are you trying to reach?
I think you have the wrong number.
It happens. Take it easy.
So why did you dial it again?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.
Who is this?
I don't think so.
Uh huh.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Just some scary movie.
Uh huh.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
No.
That's not what you said.
Nah, I don't think so...
Gotta go.
What do you want?
Dial someone else, okay?
No bored.
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
So you better leave.
Why are you doing this?
Then he dies. Right now.
Which is it?
No... please.
... please...
Don't do this. I can't...
No...
Please.. stop...
But you're doing so well.
Then answer the question. Same category.
Afraid not.
Then you should know Jason's MOTHER Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly you live.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone not much there.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
He's not a suspect, is he?
That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.
What brings you out to these parts?
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.
I like it. It's... sexy.
What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
Shit.
At the airport.
I don't know. I guess.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
Should I be worried?
Casey? Casey?
If I'm gonna blow this up I need hard proof.
Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
About thirty seconds.
I want to talk to you.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
Do you still think he's innocent?
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Many times.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?
For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who can't act who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
Your front porch.
What am I doing?
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Don't come any closer.
It would certainly improve your high school Q.
Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
You coming tonight?
What?
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.
So what's his reason?
She's saving herself for you.
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
Which is you...
It's 1995 motives are incidental.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Yeah.
My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
It's all part of the game.
You'll never get away with this.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed split open end to end.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Fucking clueless they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than... Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Uh huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Thanks, Tatum.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Good,'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin'Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Bye.
No, nothing's like it used to be.
I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.
Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
No way.
TATUM!
Okay, but whatever you did the entire student body thanks you.
Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
How's that?
Go start picking up the pieces. We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.
So far it's all dead ends. No credit history. No employment history. His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash. We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane. We may never know how he got that way.
There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony, wrath, greed...
... envy, sloth, pride and lust. Seven.
One is gluttony.
I know what you're thinking, okay? You don't want to get in bed with this every night, but it's different now. You're retiring. In six days you're all the way gone.
There was a second.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Good.
Can't you feel it yet? Can't you feel that feeling...? You're not going to be a cop anymore.
You know.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
Really?
Yeah, that's true.
It doesn't matter who I am. Who I am means absolutely nothing. You need to turn left here... at the traffic light.
I visited your home this morning, after you left.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
In two months, no one's going to even remember this happened.
It's going to be flawless. People will barely be able to comprehend it. It will seem almost surreal... but it will have a tangible reality, so they won't be able to deny it.
Oh, don't worry. You won't...
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences. It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work. I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner. I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed. An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you. Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish your meal. After him I picked the lawyer. And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one. This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
A woman...
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside. A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually. And, don't forget the disease spreading whore. Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face. That's the point. You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally. And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night. Not anymore. I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
You should be thanking me.
You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me. And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.
Really? Just biding your time, then? Toying with me. Is that it? Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in?
And, I remember breaking your nose. You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.
Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct house a. s. a. p. Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole transition thing.
I... I don't follow.
I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess. Or, at least, the same reasons you used to have for being here before... before you decided to... quit.
It's very simple. You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it. I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
Let me tell you how I want this to go. I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
Not here.
Well, over the next seven days, do me the favor of remembering it.
Drop it.
Then, why are we wasting our time? This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham. If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.
There's a bucket. Under the table.
I don't know. Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
Anyway... I did my time on door to doors, and walking a beat. I did all that shit for a long time.
The badge in my pocket says " detective, " same as yours.
Yeah, well, all I want is... Just, just don't be jerking me off. That's all I ask. Don't jerk me off.
I just don't think we should have that sort of relationship. We'd start quarreling over insignificant things.
How's that?
What about them?
I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen " Green Acres. "
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay? But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday. Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday. He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
He cut along the side of his stomach. The love handle.
This is just to satisfy my curiosity. I'm still leaving town Saturday.
We put her in a safe house.
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
Did you read them?
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin. And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
Attrition. When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
Totally unrelated victims.
What if it's not that she's seen something? What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
Who the hell knows? There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do. You know... little voices tell them bad things.
I wish I still thought like you.
All we do is pick up the pieces. We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples. We write everything down and note what time things happened...
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom. It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island. You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more room for the living.
You tell me. I'm new in town.
The fingerprints.
We'll tag along.
And?
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill. I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
Listen to me. He's all about playing games.
We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here. No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.
Sorry about that... I just...
Who pays the rent on time.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow. I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
Oh, blah, blah, blah. The guy's insane.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh? Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
We don't know for sure...
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic. The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year. To connect tubes to his genitals. To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints. He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
For a long time, the F. B. I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
They monitor reading habits. Not every book, but certain ones are flagged. Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf. Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F. B. I. from then on.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
Legal... illegal. These terms don't apply. I don't applaud it.
Yeah. Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
How do you know all about this?
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
This is stupid. It'd be just too easy.
Sure. Uh, excuse me... are you by any chance a serial killer? Oh, you are? Well, come with us then, if it's okay.
Who told you about my silver tongue? You been talking to my wife?
What happened?
You can't go in there.
We have probable cause now.
Think about how we got here!
Okay... okay... get off.
" What sick, ridiculous, puppets we are, and what a gross, little stage we dance on. What fun we have, dancing and fucking, not a care in the world. Not knowing that we are nothing. We are not what was intended. "
One birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book, " The Century of the Detective, " by Jurgen Thorwald. It traced the history of deduction as a science, and it sealed my fate, because it was real, not fiction. And, that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime... it was incredible to me.
No. Face it now. Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind. There's no winning and losing here.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children. You put the killer in jail. Who won?
Where's the victory?
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction. If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations. No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil. It's just a man.
What the fuck is wrong with you? What burnt you out?
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right? No one's worthy of you.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill. You're...
Listen to yourself. You say, " the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people. " But, you're already here. You've been here a long time. So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
Well... what the fuck, man?
Slut.
Give me a break.
There's no time to discuss it!
Put the gun down, Somerset!
Please, I need you to help me if we're going to get who did this.
Are you absolutely certain?
Why is this painting hanging upside down?
It's a nice name. William, I'd like you to meet David. David... William.
Really?
Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable. Just ask your husband.
I don't sleep very well.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
I can't be a burden, especially now. I know I'll get used to things. I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks. Upstate, it was a completely different environment. I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
I don't know...
I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision. I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently.
When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together. She was crying too hard to say anything.
Yes. Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
But Mose Harper said...
That's enough... Go on inside and help Lucy set the table... You, too, Deborah!
I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?
What you saw was a buck wearin'Lucy's dress... I found Lucy back there in that canyon... I wrapped her in my blanket an'buried her with m'own hands... I thought it best to keep it from you long as I could.
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin'marriage...
If you're talkin'about that crazy murder charge...
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
In that case, give the boys room...
Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
Well, swear him out again!... I'll go with you.
Got a warrant?
I figger a man's only good for one oath at a time... I took mine to the Confederate States of America... So did you, Reverend...
... like a flower and is cut down... Amen!
Yes, sir... But if you're wrong, Captain Clayton, don't ever give me another!
You got one now!
Captain... Nope, wouldn't say that... Likely you had your reasons for killin'Futterman... Probably needed killin'... I'm speaking as a ranger now, not as a reverend... Fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that's raised some question that and a missin'gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise.
Enough to go around... I'd say about a dozen apiece... Mount'em up!
Never mind... Your pa know you're out here?
Well you found me... Good work, son... Good work.
But he knows THAT, sir... Can't I stay, sir?
Yes, sir...
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
I've come now...
You were born old...
You help me find her, you got your rockin'chair...
Told ya, didn't I?
Scar! Where's he holed in?
That's what I said.
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
Keep talking.
And maybe you lie...
I beg your pardon?
That'll be the day...'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin'men are... You won't get any headlines for killin'squaws.
Yes, sir.
Well, fust off...
If they're still alive...
They're with'em if they're still alive.
Why?
She's your nothin'... She's no kin to you at all!
That don't make'em kin...
How? You got any horses, or money to buy'em... You ain't even got money to buy cartridges... Jorgensen's offering you a good livin'here...
Good night.
You all settled an'comfortable now?
Whatchu doin'?...
Forget it...
You got yourself a wife, sonny!
And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin'one o'their women?... No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
Think she means for us to follow?
What's the sense in it!
Ain't that too bad... If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours...
Cicatriz is Mex for Scar... an'he has a white girl in his tepee... Be seein'you...
Why didn't he make his move back there?
You can keep your will! I ain't forgettin'you was all set to shoot her yourself... What kind o'man are you, anyway.
She's alive... Better she's alive and livin'with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Comancheros...
Time's running out... But I'm obliged to you.
' Dear Miss Laury'... He spells it with a Y instead of an I... E... Wouldn't you think he'd know...
Dear Miss Laury... I take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Com anches the late Mister Futterman told us about...
I'm a woman, Martie... We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives... When you're little we even wash you.... How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
Wouldn't bother me... I wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was I you...
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
But that's Sweet face your own good horse.
It wasn't much of a letter...
But I allus loved you... You know that, without my sayin'it... I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait... the little I had... not knowin'how much longer until we found Debbie...
It's too late... She's a woman grown now...
Fetch what home?... The leavin's of Comanche bucks sold time an'again to the highest bidder?... With savage brats of her own, most like?...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?... He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
Where?
But couldn't you...?
What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
Me and the muse, of course. How is your book coming along?
I mean the armchair!
Are you crazy? That costs a fortune!
I'll do it myself.
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
Cherry red Tears.
Cherry red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times. And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
The house Tommi something just doesn't jive here...
Maybe an animal.
Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors. " There is something negative about the place... " What the hell are you trying to say? Come on! Spit it out!
Do I look like it that much?
Very funny.
Mercutio
Oh
Ah
Thank you, Ned.
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.
Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child.
You have the last act?
Tomorrow.
Wait! Will you desist!
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
Never!
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
Treachery!
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
What is the chief part?
The title?
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
How much?
You're a liar.
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Interesting.
Most interesting.
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
No, no. You have a wife, children
And your relations?
No, your marriage bed.
So now you are free to love
Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe
And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.
Take his feet out. Where will you get
It's a comedy.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
It's a crowd tickler mistaken identities, a shipwreck, a pirate king, a bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
Good title.
There's never any
Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
By order of the Master of the Revels!
So what do we do?
How?
But nothing is happening.
What happened to Sam?
Thomas Kent!
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
God be praised! Locked?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful
No it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
No, then.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
Romeo.
What?
How will it?
The show must  you know
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Wonderful, wonderful.
I have. And chinks to show for it.
Not new my Doctor Faustus.
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
And yours?
What is the story?
Romeo is  Italian. Always in and out of love.
Ethel.
The daughter of his enemy.
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
This is a different one.
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self importance!
It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six day lord and master.
Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Well monied is the same as well born and well married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
Like Valentine and Silvia?
As a nurse.
A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
What do you love so much?
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
Above Lord Wessex?
Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?
Fifty shillings. Pounds.
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.
But your voice Have they dropped?
Master Henslowe, you have your actors.
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
" Parting is such sweet sorrow  "
I have, Master Shakespeare.
Yes, I know. But he was always hanging around the house.
I'll be damned if you are!
You admire it?
Will Shakespeare!
Oh but why " alas? "
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
You can bring them with a word.
I am.
Even your play.
And that was only my first try.
Moonlight!
It was the owl come to bed
Let him be damned for his pages!
There is time. It is still dark.
It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
Oh, but it is mine too!
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers family, duty, fate as unchangeable as nature.
To be the wife of a poor player? can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
Then I will go with you.
I know how to fight!
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
" It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die. "
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
An excellent beginning Let him be  a duke. And your heroine?
At sea, then a voyage to a new world?  she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke  Orsino.
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
I don't know. It's a mystery
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
I have spoken with your father.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
No. I have spoken to the Queen. Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday. You are allowed to show your pleasure.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years...
It was your eyes. No, your lips.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
Oh! dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.
Christopher Marlowe at your service.
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin. My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches!
There was a man, poet a theatre poet, I heard does he come to the house?
An insolent penny a page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe has he been to the house?
That dog!
By God, I'll fight the lot of you
I was trying to educate you.
In the same fashion as chess.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
You're a bad loser.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
About this guy, this Hugo person.
I'm only asking what you think.
Alex, I don't have the time
No.
No.
No.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
You think so?
When are you going to let the police know?
And what about you?
So who's going to do it?
No, not that.
You know what I'm talking about.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
I can't do it.
I won't be able to.
I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
Take his legs.
Is that going to be deep enough?
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
Not now. I have an idea.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
After.
How much did you pay?
How much?
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
Oh, that'll come in useful.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
Nothing.
Not eating what?
If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
They know.
Except the money.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right good times, bad times?
But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet?
It's very kind of you to offer, but
Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Well?
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
Don't know what?
Are you recording it?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
No. Why should it?
I've never seen any of these men before.
I don't know them.
Yes, I suppose so.
Parked outside?
Sorry to waste your time.
Just one thing.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
And you like it?
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
So tell me, Cameron, what on earth just tell me, because I want to know what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
Yes.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
Well, she had problems
I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?
He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't.
Instead of what he is
Which is
The man we know and love.
Know and love?
I think you're lying.
You see, they don't really know me.
Maybe he didn't like us.
Hugo.
He's got a car?
What sort of car?
I will ask you once more, what sort of car
So?
You want me to kick it open?
Now?
All right. No problem.
I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
What are you doing?
Don't.
No.
No. The guy's dead. What more do you need?
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
Unfeasible.
I don't thinkI can.
I don't want to. It's different.
David?
Stop nagging.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
What's he doing here?
Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over. Yo!
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
No.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
You know we're right.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
We have to talk.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking
He won't do anything for me, but for you
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
We could put it somewhere.
Now you thought of that, not me.
Oh.
I refuse.
No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
What?
You mustn't take it so badly.
Don't you ever stop?
Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
What?
What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think am I right?
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
It's about the burglary.
Downstairs.
Can we come in?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
No, nothing, sorry.
Of course.
There are only two other people in the flat.
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
Yes.
Would you like to talk about it?
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Two hundred pounds.
That's what it cost, David.
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
Who have you talked to?
If I think you're lying
What?
Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
Here.
In this firm.
Accounting, David, chartered accounting
Is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
But they sneer, don't they?
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
And that's why I think you fit in here.
You get the job done.
Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
What guy?
Here?.
Oh, him. Well, he died.
Would you like to come in?
What's it about?
I see.
No.
Writing seems easy.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
All right.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
And he's a patient of yours?
For what?
The human condition.
I write about it?
No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot. No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot is variable.
Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying?
Look again if you like.
Same as everyone else.
Yes.
Diseases.
I suppose so.
Sorry?
Or a fake?
Chicken salad.
I don't know, I think...
No.
Don't you like her?
Then what's the problem?
What're you talking about, George?
That kid... the hairdresser.
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
What?
No, doll, I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right.
I just thought you'd like to know
Cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
You make me sick. Just be straight for once in your life.
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl or that she'll keep her hands off him.
Think what you have time to think, Lester.
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
You mean that girl, don't you?
Why not?
What?
Yeah, I think so.
I don't know.
I know.
She did?
Wow.
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
I'll be back in a while.
I'll be right back, baby, really.
I don't want to talk about it...
I don't care.
I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
Nummers.
Numbers, and I don't need to place myself in that kind of position.
To be put in that kind of position...
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
What're you doing later?
We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
Your husband?
What about?
Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
No, I know.
I know.
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
She what?
And who's Jill?
Don't be silly. I'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints. See?
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
A little.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Chopped liver?
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
Did you hear me?
Well, are you? Are you queer?
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
I asked you first.
Making it with my mother?
... just, you could look very heavy...
What?
No kidding.
No shit.
Yeah.
Yeah...
No.
That you're just like your mother.
You are.
You are.
Yeah.
How is she?
Wonderful woman.
I went to school with her husband.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
And you need money?
You do know what money's like these days.
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half no, we won't be going back to the old days.
It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
Pardon me?
I mean credit references, Mr. Roundy.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Yes, Buffums.
You promised you'd do the show.
Don't use that tone of voice with me... never mind, I'll take Gordon.
You do it.
You are today.
I don't know. Probably not.
Great... so how's everything with you?
I'm sure.
Yeah he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
What for? Honey, I'll see you later.
Well, I do.
Can't you do it out here?
You would?
You don't seem very sure.
She's incredible... She loves you, George.
What's wrong?
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
The shrink? Many times.
And?
Did you?
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
Did you?
You know what I'm talking about.
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
Well, did you or didn't you?
One of my few virtues is discretion.
You're a genius.
Don't, don't, don't...
Sit down!
What guy?
He's a director.
Looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job I've
C'mon, cunt, you're going for a walk.
Why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you
Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? C'mon
I don't know what gets into me.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
You don't think so? I do.
You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
He still having parties?
Am I entertaining you?
Sure.
What?
Ass and legs
Me?
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
Last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.
Why?
Look about last night
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
Well then what are you trying to do
So I'm saying it...
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
I don't know... Jackie?
I can't just let him stand by the door...
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
I don't know I've got to.
Right after I sprayed her?
She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is!
Oh yeah?
Yeah?...
I'm busy, man.
Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
What with?
But then again you ask for it you just like my Otis can't keep his hands outta ladies'hair either.
Otis?
You shouldn't do me like that...
You know better...
Left my bag, didn't have no money...
Took a bus.
I have to see you.
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Okay!
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Here in the canyon.
Let me come, too. Please don't leave me alone.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
I just... who what?
You'll do what I tell you. Now get the fuck inside.
Now, George
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
Right now I'm at the epitome of my life. Right now I feel so good I'm afraid something's gonna happen.
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days see I'm disgusted with my life.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
You're different.
You're great.
Yeah.
Hey, baby I'm gonna retire with you.
Why am I great?
But in the same house, you know, one house.
You've never even been around one.
Yeah.
George?
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Hey, I'm, you know
Go where?
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
Great... can we talk later?
I already said hello.
George.
When can I talk to you?
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
Whether or not I'm going.
Egypt.
No, but I think they might.
They didn't offer you the job yet.
Right now?
Look, baby, can we talk about it later?
When is that?
When is that, George?
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
What?
... Okay...
A friend dropped me off.
Never mind. Where've you been?
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
Television or movies?
Well aren't you
Okay I'll see you later. Your house.
Bullshit.
Well that's something.
You didn't plan on fucking him tonight.
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
I'd like you to leave now.
Who knows, I'm sure you don't but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed.
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
What do you wanna know for?
What difference does it make?
Baby, don't do this
Please, baby
How?
Does it make you happy?
Yes.
George...
Please!... that's not like you.
George, now cut this out.
Stop it.
Yes, yes, I did.
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
George...
I said you were a loser!
No.
You need a cut.
Said what!
Well, baby, I'm George and it needs to be cut. But I don't want to place you in that position either.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
But what?
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
Who needs that kind of aggravation? Who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? When I finish work I want to...
So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.
Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
That, and... I'll be done in a minute.
I know it, I know it.
I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me
Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
See she doesn't drink too much.
No it keeps the skin peeling. You've got to keep the follicles open. You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it.
Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there layer so it kind of fluffs out
All night.
What do they look like?...
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Godammit, George...
Sit down.
I said sit down!
I wanna hear about it.
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
No, not yet, not yet. You worry about it for a while, I've been worrying all night, now you can worry.
Did they have something against me?
I wanna hear it from you!
Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
Why, why do you think that is?
Well, I don't know.
Have a drink.
I'll have to wash one out.
Me!
I was gonna give you the money. Probably I was. Shit, I don't know, I don't know anything anymore.
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter. I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
What about Jackie?
I mean, how did that happen?
She's nothing but a whore.
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
I'm finished with her.
Yeah, the clap. That's what she thinks. But who knows I don't know.
A daytime soap opera.
I was too old.
Somebody's mother.
Sid.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
Yes.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
No kidding? Your own shop?
Who were you talking to?
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Whatever his name is, that actor.
I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
Of course not.
You're still jealous.
You ought to get rid of those dogs.
No.
Because I don't want one.
Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.
Does she know about us?
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying George
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
That's right.
Fine.
Anyway, you're crazy.
A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
You're really a love you sure?
Well, what is it, honey?
It must be something.
I thought you said things were great with George.
We don't think marriage is important.
Yeah, honey...
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
How much?
What?
He does?
It's been so long I don't how long?
I would say so, yes.
What?
Well not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
C'mon.
Yesss?
Uhh huhh...
... Mmm hmmm.
He reached up and tore them.
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
But why Egypt?
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Sort of.
Johnny!
What does he do? Is he an actor?
Good for you.
Not with your hairdresser.
Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
You're going?
Johnny! Why didn't you tell me before?
He'll never know the difference.
Oh that's no problem. take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
There's not much room
Jill.
Thank you.
Three weeks.
Do you have children?
Are you married?
Do you have something against traveling?
Thanks for coming by.
Everybody but us.
Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
I'm hungry.
They had to, in order to survive.
Good. I want you to have a good time.
Yes.
I can't. I have too much to do.
Yes?
Good. I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Are you sure?
Good.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Who's Tony?
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Yes.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see. Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel over the years, and not all of them was good.
Room 237?
Nothing. There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out! You understand, stay out!
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Yeah, I know. It always takes a little time to make new friends.
Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
And you're gonna lose. And I'm gonna get you you betta run fast! Look out I'm coming in close. All right?
Give me your hand. Oh, isn't it beautiful.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Can I go to my room and get my fire engine?
I won't make any noise.
I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip toe.
Red Rum.
Mommy... Mommy...!
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Is Tony one of your animals?
No.
Because he hides.
To my stomach.
Yes, I'd like you to.
Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
It's okay, really.
Sure.
Yes sir. Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
Delbert Grady.
Why no, sir. I don't believe so.
Oh, they're somewhere around. I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.
Who?
A nigger!
Well, he is a very willful boy.
For the moment, Mr. Grady. Only for the moment.
You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
Good evening, Mr. Halloran. What can I do for you?
All right, sir.
This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
Oh Wendy. That's nice. That's the prettiest.
Yeah, this is it. How do you like it, Danny? Is it big enough for you?
Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
I did?
Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.
Sound good to you, Danny?
Pleasure to meet you.
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
Well, I'm looking for a change.
That's swell. I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you. You were always the best of them.
I hope it's nothing serious.
What'll it be, sir?
Great. Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through. I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.
It's about eleven thirty.
I know it.
Yeah. It's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place. I tell you, when we first came up here, I thought it was kinda scarey.
Wendy, let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
Fine. Now we're going to make a new rule. Whenever I am in here and you hear me typing,
Fine. Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.
And you didn't see anything at all?
You mean just leave the hotel?
Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far, but I'm not going to let you fuck this up!
You can't remember.
Yes...
Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
I just want to go back to my room.
Stay away...!
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me.
Stop it!
Stay... stay away!
Jack, stay away from me!
Get down.
Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
I'm gonna go now.
I'm Jack Torrance.
Well, that's very good time, very good. Please sit down a minute.
Susie.
Oh, it sure would be
... the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to... to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur. And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
Can of itself be a problem.
How about your wife and son? How do you think they'll take to it?
Great...
I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
Well, that is eh quite a story.
Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
All the best people.
How're you getting on?
Yes.
Jack is a schoolteacher.
Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison pen letters?
Jesus.
When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
Brady's a booger and so are you!
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Stop it!
Went shopping. Why?
Will you marry me, Jane?
You're a real booger, you know it?
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
Well... it is his third.
Rattling. Rustling.
And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's
Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
There's a saying so and so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
Huh?
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
Don't call me dear boy.
Uh huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
It goes fast, all right and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys'Choir.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Good.
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
Save this one for last.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
Was it a prescription?
It wasn't I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
Well... was it a prescription?
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
No we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
Shut up, dear boy no gloating allowed.
It could have been anything, Marty.
No.
I saw what I saw.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
Will you do it?
I know what I said, Marty but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
I will be good, kids.
Well... yes. Yes it is.
I said I was a nun, not an asshole.
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
I think I hear it!
You know, I just might!
LET THY SPIRIT
HE'S SO FINE...
SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!
And I'm tearful!
YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE
Probation?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
What you do?
You know it.
Then stop trying to memorize it. Hit the road.
What?
That... thing. That nun thing. Take it off.
Who? The other woman. Your wife.
How did I get so lucky? What is it now, five years we've been together? Who do I thank?
He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell. For all eternity.
You bastard!
You pig!
Thanks. A lot.
Sure.
Right. Yeah. Forgotten.
What, Vincent? This is me, doll. I know you. What did you think you were doing? Running to the cops. Hiding out. No, no. You're sorry now, aren't you?
This prom is a real drag.
Oh my!
Look at that. Get a gander.
He's so dreamy. He's like... a Greek god. He's the cutest guy here. He's boss. He's fab. He's...
HE'S SO FINE.
WISH HE WAS MINE. THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.
I used to buy. you,.. stuff. On your birthday. When we were seeing each other.
So I don't shop.
Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then. I told people you were a hooker!
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant? What do you want cheap thrills?
Think again! And get out of here.
I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me! They tried to kill me! I'm not kidding!
Screw you!
All right! I get the picture! I'll do it! I'll testify!
No nothing.
I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
With nuns? With rulers? No way. I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.
Everywhere but this little hole in the wall convent. Nobody knows you're here but me. We're trying to get a quick court date. A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
Pray.
But I'm going insane! All these people do is pray and work, work and pray! I don't get it when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food! Gruel it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie anything fall off yet? Get me outta her!
Like what?
You son of a bitch!
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
It wasn't my fault! They just showed up. It's helping the convent.
I really can't talk about it now. The place is packed. SRO. I've got a show to do.
I know that. This isn't about me. It's about the choir. You should hear them. They're good. Really good. And I taught them.
I am?
Really? Lieutenant?
You're not... seeing anybody?
I have?
I know, I know. I'll be careful. I'll try.
Long story. His goons will be here any minute. We've got to get you out of here'now!
I've got a show at St. Matthew's Cathedral. We're singing for the Cardinals.
That's not the point! They need me!
Nuns?
Yeah, like what?
Where's who?
I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
We're the guys from Vegas. You had Christy last night, but you let her get away. It's upsetting.
That she's a nun! That chick you're looking for she's a nun!
You know so much. They've got Christy, and we've got to find her. Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge. Fax it to every contact we got.
What's the problem?
You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
Can you hold? Can you try?
Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.
He came to me. He promised great violence. Said I should cast you out for my own protection. I must speak honestly. There is no reason to think he will not meet with success.
Never. A shoe that size I would have remembered.
You must have missed your mark.
I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this...
No, sir, no. If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
It's not something people speak of openly. She did not remarry.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
Well... so much for common sense.
At times I do.
You are horribly old fashioned, aren't you?
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse. I'll leave you to your business.
Other people?
It might have been more. Might have been positively grand talk.
My suitor?
He has proposed to me twice.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
Really? Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
You are funny.
You pay great attention to small things. I hide these as I hide all my books. Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
It would be interesting to find out.
Yes, but listen. The illusion is easily explained. The eye retains each image, till they combine. And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
Very well. But, it will only sit gathering dust.
People have put their trust in you.
Won't they still have that justice? Or, was it a vain promise?
I have misjudged you I think. I did not imagine you were so cruel.
What are you on about?
Must I hear this?
And this gives worth to butchery?
What is it then? Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane. He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand. But, what do you want?
But, why? Tell me why.
What has happened?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
What happened to your mother? Is she still alive?
Memories have come back. I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now. Lord, how I hate this place.
I... I do not know. I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
I apologize if I worried you.
But, I am not alone, am I? I only wished to see what you were up to, and... To thank you.
Yes. I did notice that, thank you.
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it. I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
He did not do these things. If you knew him, you would realize...
I have not been able to face him yet.
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
If you think I am behind this, say it.
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
We have no choice.
In a way, yes.
Sit.
Karl, they's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with. Now there's one more thing. The way we lock these doors at night, you can't get out. You didn't want to go anywhere, did you?
There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, " Boy this water's cold. " Old boy from Arkansas says " Yeah, and it's deep too. " Get it? That's a goodun.
Well, yeah it's a classic. You know, Karl, I got to thinkin'about it last night and it's just not Christian of me to not let you have a key. I mean you been in lockup so long, you don't need me keepin'you locked up. You need to come and go as you please. Here, take this key, it'll get you in and out that back door. Them french fries good?
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
Yeah, me too.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin'the bus and eatin'french fried potaters.
All right then.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin'along on that garden tiller?
You done fixed it? I'll be damned. Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed.'Course Scooter's about as shitless as one poor son of a bitch can be. You done fixed it. I'll just be damned. See you tomorrow.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin'me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did. Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of'em.
Well, I ain't scared of him workin'here. You know me. I'm a church goin'man. Forgivin'man. When your time's up the Lord's gonna come git you. You seared of him, Scooter?
Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'll take it out of your pocket anyway.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss. This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
Doin'pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin'things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin'or anything. But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin'things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
He's gone to stayin'over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
Sure.
Well, what did you want?
Naw, we don't have biscuits.
Well, I guess it's all good.
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
Yeah.
Sixty for small and seventy five for large.
Yeah.
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead. He got hit by a train.
About a half a mile I think it is.
Okay. You don't have to though.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it? I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Yeah.
We run outta somethin'to drink. Goin'to the county line. You want to race?
Catch you later Freddy!
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin'me to get an ice cream.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
Frank, why don't you go off and play in your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty.
Who could eat with him settin'there makin'that goddamn racket with his throat.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin'Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
You don't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low.
Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done called him. He'll be here. Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I need you to help me ice down a tub of beer, you and Frank.
You know better than to talk like that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make me knock the piss out of you.
That might be better than this.
Leave.
Leave.
Leave.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
I'll be back in a little bit then.
Now son, I wadn't talkin'to you, was I? Was I?
No sir's right. I'm talkin'to your mama. This is your mama's decision, not yours. I'm lettin'it go on because she asked me, not you. Now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that,'cause I have trouble eatin'around that kind of thing. Just like I am about antique furniture and midgets. I can't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture. Same thing with a droolin'retard.
Well, I hate you, too. No I don't. I love your mama. Nobody understands what I go through. I'll leave. You bunch of freaks have fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey. I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass, really. You ever hit me again you little bastard and I'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin'at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
You enjoying yourself, Karl?
Sarcastic right? You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We'd be glad to have you.
I'll kill you, you fuckin'faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back.
What's all them books?
You believe in the Bible?
Well, I can't understand none of it. This one begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another. Just how retarded are you?
Karl Childers just in from the state facility. Make one of them gruntin'sounds Karl or whatever it is you do. Oh well, Karl's a little retarded, he don't know what the hell I'm talkin'about. And to Vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients. Now that takes balls. Our number one tune for the folks, boys. Kick it off Johnson!
Pick up the fuckin'phone and call'em, I guess.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin'to relax and look at TV. What are you doin'with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
They're from the Dollar Store. I'm not an idiot. Besides we have a garden full of flowers.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
But maybe just for awhile
What are all them books?
How come you're carryin'them around with you.
Don't you live somewhere?
Why'd you live there?
They let you out?
How come?
Are you well?
You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
Me and the Burnett twins and some boys plays down at the junior high practice field all the time. If you ever want to come by and play. We ain't no good either. Well, I'll see you later.
Yeah. What you doin'by here?
Did you want to play ball with us?
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin'to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin'two till eight.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin'if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
They sell some of everything. Come on let's go. I won't tell her about you bein'in the state hospital for killin'.
They still around, your folks?
How do you know?
How did your mama die?
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of'em. When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin'so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin'nothin'could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now. Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
She says it's for the times when he's good to her. She's lonely since daddy died. She said sometimes she don't know why. He threatened to kill her if she ever left him. My daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real good to mama. Vaughan that you met. But he's not able to do anything to Doyle, he's funny you know. Not funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes to go with men instead of women. That makes him not to be able to fight too good. He sure is nice though. He's from St. Louis. People who are queer can get along better in a big town. He got transferred here to work. But mama said the real reason he left is'cause his daddy hated him. For bein'the way he is. I wish he liked to go with women. I'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than Doyle.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
' Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine. Karl, did you really kill somebody?
Who did you kill?
Were they bad people?
Maybe they needed it.
It's okay if you're lookin'out for yourself. If it's self defense. Was it self defense?
Well, I hate him.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
I like the way you talk.
Where'd you get them flowers?
I was goin'to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
You want to go with me?
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
Yeah, me too. That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
I was wantin'to ask you somethin'.
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
I ain't got no money to get'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
Just'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin'around, sex and all.
What do you mean?
Oh, jackin'off?
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin'about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin'about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
I kind of like you tellin'me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin'me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother. Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know'em like what happened with me and you.
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny. You know why I want you to play ball with me?
' Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin'it. When you run real fast tryin'to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin'up to play with?
Why not? It died?
Why?
So it died when it come out?
It was alive?
A boy or girl?
You threw it in a trash barrel?
It was still alive when you buried it?
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm. Did you ever think about killin'yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
Bible says the same thing about killin'others, too.
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin'over tonight and he's talkin'about movin'in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
Yeah.
Yessir.
We're liable to win if we keep this up. For somebody like you, you sure run fast.
You're strong though. You let me make them touchdowns so I'd feel good. My daddy used to do that kind of thing.
It was fun, anyhow.
Can we play ever'Saturday?
Just diggin'. I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin'in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
Karl, I ain't tryin'to say nothin'bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
I aim fer you to have'em.
Yes sir.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Will ye do somethin'for me if I ast you to?
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
I know he does.
Huh?
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now. I love you.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. Said I was well.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin'at me, too.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
All right then.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Your daddy's still livin'down there from what you told me. I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin'my job. You follow me? Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin'on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here. I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
Well, I guess we better hit the road.
Do they know about you?
Yeah.
I'll be.
I knew you'd do all right. Well, I just wanted to check on you. I'll say bye to Bill and get on back.
Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Yes ma'am.
Mustard's good on'em to me.
I wouldn't mind a havin'supper.
I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.
I killed my mother and a old boy name Jesse Dixon. I thought they was a doin'wrong. I was about your boy's age. They say I'm well now from it.
I believe you. I really do.
Well, okay. I got you some.
Where'd he go? What's goin'on?
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Yeah.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
We sure like havin'you.
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
What brings you back?
Why are you here now?
Is that right? Are you going to be staying here long?
Do you have family here?
That boy wants me to.
Naw, I ain't.
Quite a spell, I reckon.
I done et just a little bit ago.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin'or'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin'it tomorrow.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way. There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?
Before that I was thinkin'it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.
Okay.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
What about me?
Karl is a guy guy?
I'm sorry.
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
Yeah.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage. Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book a notebook. On every page it says " Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1. " He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.
I didn't mean that.
Where will he go?
Will he be supervised?
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
Yes.
No! At least I don't think I am!
An invitation?
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
Ah hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go
And what are you, his chaperone?
No wonder it's such a screwed up place.
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
I keep waiting for the next novel to come out. Anything in the works?
And your father? Is he from New York?
Just like me.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
Melville, huh? It's been a while.
Not an easy book.
What happened?
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Uh... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
Forty one pages.
What about for you?
Do me a favor, will you?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, " Two corned beef sandwiches. " When you want two ginger ales, say, " Two ginger ales. "
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
Definitely. I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First. Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
It's yours?
I didn't know you took pictures.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
How'd you get started?
A photographer...
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
I've never seen anything like it.
Amazing. I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this... this project?
It's kind of overwhelming.
What do you mean?
But they're all the same.
Slow down, huh?
How old, kid?
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
No, he's not. You are.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
No. The... uh... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull. Assaultus interruptus.
For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose.
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
Or didn't. There's no way of knowing, is there?
You usually get two.
Ah hah.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea. You know anything about Christmas stories?
Anything good?
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
I'm all ears.
Every word.
She probably died.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
Yes, I suppose I do.
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful. What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble hock it for a bottle of gin?
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to come in, tell'em we're closed. You got that?
Like what?
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did which I don't she wouldn't be our daughter.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now. Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Fifteen years ago? It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth.
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
She looks just like you.
When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.
Still, you can't just write her off.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
No you're not.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
No, bully for you.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
And you're giving it to me?
For keeps?
I can't believe it. Oh God, I can't believe it. You're an angel, Auggie. An angel from heaven.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead end job like this for?
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
Lovely.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there.
Open it.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
So I can get my job back.
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
It'll never be finished.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell.
Jesus, man, you're one fucking mess.
I thought maybe he was pretending.
Seventy eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
Fifty six. That girl had on a corset.
Forty four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you? Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: " A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
Damned if I know. But it has a nice ring to it, don't it?
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
I'm looking for my nephew, Thomas.
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
I just want to know where he is.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself. Do you mind if I sit down? He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
No thank you.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this. A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
I figured he had a right to know.
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, " I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son of a bitch is dead. "
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty seven cents in that cash register over there and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night. You live in this town or on your way from here to there?
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks. Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
Son of a bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken down shit hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do.
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it? It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
Benefits?
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
And have you mended them?
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
Hi there, little brother.
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
Thomas.
You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now!
Aren't you going to say anything?
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
What are you talking about?
Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.
They didn't have to do a thing, that's all I'm saying. The team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. But then they had to screw it up. They traded their birthright for a mess of porridge. A mess of porridge.
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
So what's the time?
No harm done. Everything's okay now. I've got to be going.
I just happened to be there. The right place at the right time.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
Well, if you put it that way...
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
I don't drink coffee. On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Rashid. Rashid Cole.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
East Seventy fourth Street.
Of course. Where else?
That's where the what comes in.
The what. I've kind of run away from home, you see. It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
Yeah, that's right.
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it. I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way. The world is in your head, remember?
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
Twelve, thirteen years ago. Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Eight thirty.
You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast. Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes. Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias.
If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise. It might be worth it.
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember? If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
Three nights.
Two or three nights.
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me... But all good things have to come to an end, right?
You don't have to apologize. The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Absolutely. The world is my oyster. Whatever that means.
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man.
You too. And make sure the light is green before you cross the street. Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I think you're a hell of a good writer.
Appreciation for what?
Where did you get that thing?
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
Close the door. Sit down in that chair. Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
And?
So that's the something you weren't supposed to see, huh?
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Let's not get too idealistic.
Thanks.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go. Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
All right. Listen carefully. About twenty five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
No, not the end. The beginning. His son was just a little boy at the time, but the years passed, and when he grew up, he became a skier, too. One day last winter, he went out by himself for a run down the mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock. Just as he's unwrapping his cheese sandwich, he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice right there at his feet. He bends down to take a closer look, and suddenly he feels that he's looking into a mirror, that he's looking at himself. There he is dead and the body is perfectly intact, sealed away in a block of ice like someone preserved in suspended animation. He gets down on all fours, looks right into the dead man's face, and realizes that he's looking at his father.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
His only copy. I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
You don't believe me, huh? Look, I'll show you. It's all in this book.
Yeah, it might be.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
And started to run.
Good thinking.
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you? So how much does it come to?
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
Keep up with that attitude, and you won't have a future. Seventeen is a hell of an age to die. Is that what you want?
Well?
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
No wonder he was angry.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
Research. I worked the scene right into my story. That makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible.
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
I don't mean to pry, but I see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back, and I begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions aren't stowed in there. Are you in some kind of trouble or what?
Fries?
Lettuce and tomato?
You want another one of these, too?
Hid it from my mom. Caught a mess a sea runs. Damn thing's still in my closet.
They fished t'gether. Went to school. Carl Junior treated him like a white person. Like any friend.
Why? If they could never take title.
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
Did he see some danger from defen...
Second question. What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
So that makes what would have been  4500 into  7000, doesn't it? If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of  2500.
It is.
Happy for him. And relieved.
Closer to eight.
And then, something did. Carl Heine was found dead. With his head crushed.
We were afraid. Silence seemed better. To come forward seemed like a mistake.
I said. No further questions.
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
The Japs did it.
It's not for the. They only get to convict him.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
More than eager. He was out to make a point.
From Carl Heine's boat. All his were like this one, three strand manila, new condition, braided in loops. Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
Found on Carl's boat, too. Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's. perfect.
And replaced it later with the new one. That's your inference?
And why. Is that?
Japanese stick fighting. They're trained as kids, y'know. To kill with sticks.
My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
Oh, yes.
Were you, sir? Can you prove one word of all your fancy story?
And then your stroke came this summer. And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7. Which, remember, is eight days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
You mean, this morning. The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth? That's a question, sir.
Didn't go anywhere else? No errands, no purchases? Just straight to the boat. That's the truth.
I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones. in the middle of the night.
Well, why does it?
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there. So he climbs up. To cut it down.
Coincidences happen. You run a yellow light just as a car comes out of nowhere. Split second tragedy happens every day. Or maybe...
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working. Same report Milholland heard. And that makes him get the lantern fast. Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
Then where's the lantern? And where's the knife?
Well, anything coulda caused that.
Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
Sure you did. Help me with this hold cover, willya?
And what do you believe?
Maybe.
And yet you started the engine right up. With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge. Did that strike you odd?
Does it now?
You have to wonder.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery. A D 6 is one inch wider than a D 8. It would be too large for the deceased's well.
But he had a spare D 6, you said. Right there. Why not use that?
No spare.
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with no spare battery, hmmn?
I'm curious. The D 6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
You don't. Think so.
You don't. Remember.
And her farmhouse...?
What else could it be?
You said that. That was your testimony.
Well...
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around? Or would both look the same.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
Is it possible?
Is it fair to say that you do not know for certain which it was.
And that you can't say for certain whether the head injury was sustained before or after death?
For the third time, yes.
Absolutely not. Probably one or two hours. Four at the most.
Mmmmmm. Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying...
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit... and they've always got the job done. Now these new ones, these " hot shots " of yours... what kind of action have they seen? They are battle tested, aren't they?
The sweep is just routine, not even police action. I'd like to see some sort of... meaningful evidence...
Maybe we could run some tests. Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...
Whatever the latest jargon is. MEKUM Much better, much higher. For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety nine percent without sexual inclination. It's all aggression. SLOAN Real men! CHURCH At ease, Lieutenant. What if they fought? A sudden silence. SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look. Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up. MEKUM You mean up there? CHURCH Go ahead, Rube. Tell Todd to take him. MEKUM No! They all look at MEKUM. Is this the chink in the armor? The new soldiers can't fight? CHURCH " No "? MEKUM Not fair. No contest. Send two more of your old ones up. Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned. They exchange a glance. MEKUM Go ahead.
Okay, doll.
Forget it, doll. After all, you work here I work here and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Listen, doll what time do you get off tonight?
Because I'm working the night shift and I got a bottle of gin stashed away and as soon as there's a lull
Wanna see my driver's license?
That's the way I like'em big and sassy. And get rid of your roommate.
Never mind leaving your door open I got a passkey.
All right, girls. Who does this belong to? Come on, now. Speak up. Sugar, I warned you!
I don't know but I can feel it right here. That's one good thing about ulcers it's like a burglar alarm going off inside you.
You're welcome.
My suitcase with all my resort clothes.
The one legged jockey said'Don't worry about me, baby. I ride side saddle. '
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
It's just a little inlay it doesn't even have to be gold
You're right, Joe.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
We're not?
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
But suppose he loses?
But suppose it doesn't?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out Moe said no more knackwurst on credit and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail
Sam the Bookie? Nothing doing! You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
But we'll freeze it's below zero we'll catch pneumonia.
Look at the bull fiddle it's dressed warmer than I am.
With me?
It did? Boy, did it ever!
Right. We have the same blood type...
You've flipped your wig!
Josephine and Geraldine! Come on!
You don't see any blood?
That's not far enough. You don't know those guys! But they know us. Every hood in Chicago will be looking for us
We got to get out of town. Maybe we ought to grow beards.
Shave? At a time like this? Those guys got machine guns they're going to blast our heads off and you want to shave?
I feel so naked. Like everybody's looking at me.
This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight with all kinds of goodies around jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts
Done what?
You'd better go fix it.
How about the shape of that liquor cabinet?
Look no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
We would be caught dead with men. Those rough, hairy beasts with eight hands They all want just one thing from a girl.
But suppose I got to go like for a drink of water?
But suppose I lose? Suppose it's an emergency?
Break it up, girls! Daphne! Come on, help me!
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
They don't care just as long as you wear skirts. It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
Blow where?
How can we? We're broke.
Listen, stupid right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what? Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
What's the beef? We're sitting pretty. We get room and board we get paid every week there's the palm trees and the flying fish
Me? After Sugar?
What are you talking about? Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
This happens to me all the time in public.
What message? What motorboat?
Oh, he does!
Fat chance! You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
And where's he going to be?
With ME?
Oh, no! Not tonight, Josephine!
Remember he's your date for tonight. So smile.
Because we're pals buddies the two musketeers.
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
What happened?
Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?
WHAT?
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
Jerry! You can't be serious!
But you're not a girl. You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
I'll say there is!
Jerry there's another problem.
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
You're out of your mind! How can you get away with this?
Like when?
Oh.
Jerry, listen to me there are laws conventions it's just not being done!
Look, Jerry take my advice forget the whole thing just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
What engagement present?
Wait a minute lets not be hasty. After all, we don't want to hurt poor Osgood's feelings.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Joe
Okay, Joe.
Sugar?
What do you think you're doing?
Since when? Usually you leave'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
Drop her a postcard. Any minute now those gorillas may be up here
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
What did we do? Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
There you go with that we again.
Elope? But there are laws conventions
That's all right. I was afraid it was Sweet Sue. You won't tell anybody, will you?
See you around, girls.
Honey she called me honey.
It's nothing. I just think us girls should stick together.
It must be freezing outside. When I think of you and your poor ukulele
Oh, I can think of a million things
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister. We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
Anything wrong?
Why you poor thing you're trembling all over.
And your head is hot.
And you've got cold feet.
Let me warm them a little. There isn't that better?
I'm a very sick girl.
I'm not that sick.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
I know where to get some. Don't move.
How's the bottle?
No no lights. We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
So spill it. Spills, thrills, laughs, games this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
Uh uh. Not yet.
We better have a drink first.
No fair guessing.
You betcha.
I mean, your shoulders and your arms
But there's one thing I envy you for.
You're so flat chested. Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
Okay.
I'm a what?
Sugar, dear let me give you some advice. If I were a girl and I am I'd watch my step.
Yeah Josephine.
Neither can I. Come on lets go up to her room and tell her right now.
That's funny. Josie I can't imagine where she can be.
No, no, Sugar wait. I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
Yeah. This is one for Ripley.
That's it. Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.
What do you think, Josephine? What does it say in your crystal ball?
No!
What for?
I always did.
Thirty four.
That's what I call a louse! If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
I thought you said three years.
I'm sorry. I was having a nightmare. Something I ate. I'm not at all well. See? Hot water bottle.
We could dye our hair.
We could
What's with him he drinks?
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
Yes, indeed. It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
No it's showgirls. I've been married seven or eight times.
Mama is keeping score. Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida. Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht deep sea fishing.
Oh, of course. which of these instruments do you play?
Fascinating. Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
You must be quite a girl.
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer you know, sort of a contortionist she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes Zowie! but Mama broke it up.
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
This is where I get off.
Well, then, why don't we go dancing? I know a little road house, down the coast
About that roadhouse
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
You're leading again.
Come one!
We can have it altered.
Why not?
It doesn't matter.
I don't care.
I forgive you.
We'll adopt some.
Well nobody's perfect.
Got it. Supper yacht after the show I'll tell her. Your yacht?
Oh, that's all taken care of. I'm giving them shore leave. We'll have a little cold pheasant and champagne and I checked with the Coast Guard there'll be a full moon tonight oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records
Wait a minute. Where do you think you're going?
You ain't going nowhere.
You won't breathe nothing'not even air.
Thank you.
You're making it up pretty good so far.
Because I got some plans
And you'll be in all evening?
Good! Then you won't be needing your car.
The instruments are right, but you are not. I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
What kind of band is this, anyway?
You got it. It's six dollars a man. Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock
Yes, we're the new girls.
Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
I play the ukulele. And I sing too.
Better keep a lookout.
I wouldn't say that. Careless, maybe.
Then why did you take this job?
Afford it?
Me?
Rough?
You can't trust those guys.
Bingo?
Really?
That so?
You know I play tenor sax.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You don't say?
Men!
Brains aren't everything.
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
About the future. You know like a husband? That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Millionaires. Flocks of them. They all go south for the winter. Like birds.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
I want mine to wear glasses.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
They get those weak eyes from reading you know, all those long columns of tiny figures in the Wall Street Journal.
Why not?
Want to switch berths with me?
Not at all.
Seventy five. That's three quarters of a century. Makes a girl think.
What else? And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw so he threw it right in my face.
What makes you so sure?
You're not hurt, are you?
I wish you'd make sure.
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Thank you.
Now, really
Are you staying at the hotel?
Your face is familiar.
That must be it.
Your view of what?
You have a yacht?
I quite agree. Tell me, who runs up that flat your wife?
And who mixes the cocktails your wife?
I'm not interested at all.
That's very interesting.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
No the ukulele. And I sing.
Well a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
Oh, yes. Quite. You know Vassar, Bryn Mawr we're only doing this for a lark.
Yeah. Real hot.
So do I. as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
They do indeed. Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore coming out parties, cotillions
Opening of the Opera
And always the same Four Hundred.
You're very kind. I'll bet you're also very gentle and helpless
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better. What are you doing tonight?
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
Why?
Oh?
You collect shells?
Shell Oil?
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Guess!
You don't say!
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute collects shells.
Because he said he's coming to hear us play maybe.
For me? It's Shell Oil.
It's the thought that counts.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer
Three?
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio. Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Love it. Which way?
What a beautiful fish.
What is it?
A herring? Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
Down the hatch as we say at sea.
Water polo isn't that terribly dangerous?
Where's your shell collection?
What's on Thursdays?
You mean we're alone on the boat?
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before in the middle of the night in the middle of the ocean.
It's not the icebergs. But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Harmless how?
What thing?
You mean like frigid?
Have you tried?
Complete washout.
Oh, it's not your fault. It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve. Something goes wrong inside.
Not anymore. I was in love once but I'd rather not talk about it. How about a little cold pheasant?
I don't want to bore you.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton there was this girl her name was Nellie her father was vice president of Hupmobile she wore glasses, too. That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset suddenly we had an impulse to kiss I took off my glasses I took a step toward her she took a step toward me
Yes. Eight hours later they brought her up by mule I gave her three transfusions we had the same blood type Type O it was too late.
Ever since then numb no feelings. Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
Yes all the money in the world but what good is it? Mint sauce or cranberries?
What else is there for me?
My family did everything they could hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails what a waste of money!
Why?
Don't talk like that. I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls but could I take another crack at it?
Would you like a little more champagne? And maybe if we had some music how do you dim these lights?
So inhale!
They told me I was caputt finished washed up and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Let's make it an even million.
Nice? It was suicidally beautiful.
That's wonderful. Poor Josephine.
Daphne has a beau I have a beau if we could only find somebody for you.
I'll meet you on the pier again right after the show.
Tomorrow night?
Where to? South America? Oh. That is unexpected.
A merger? How long will you be gone?
You're not?
Oh that kind of a merger. Is she young? Pretty?
Oh, of course. I understand. At least, I think I do.
Smart move. Oh, by the way did you get my flowers? You know, those orchids from my greenhouse the fog finally lifted over Long Island, and they flew them down this morning.
Real diamonds. They must be worth their weight in gold. Are you always this generous?
I didn't do anything. It just happened.
Goodbye, my darling.
You'll forget him, Sugar.
Do yourself a favor go back where the millionaires are the sweet end of the lollipop not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed out tube of toothpaste
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
PLEASE!
Show the gentleman to the chapel pew number three.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour mash coffee...
Some people got no respect for the dead.
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers. I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
You'll like it there. I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats striped!
Embalming people with coffee eighty six proof.
Come on, Spats we know you own this joint. Mozarella is just fronting for you.
We got different information.
Toothpick Charlie? Never heard of him.
These are my lawyers all Harvard men.
I heard you opera lovers were having a little rally so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Say, Maestro where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
What's his first name? And where does he live?
Where did they play it in a garage on Clark Street?
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats they had blood on them.
You shave with your spats on?
Quit kidding. You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie and we know it.
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Yeah. You never know who's going to be next. Okay, Spats. Report to the Sergeant at Arms.
Orders from Little Bonaparte.
Exactly! Today  s my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
But I  m not taking your name, buster. I  m a feminist! I need icey! Mr. husband man, get me more icey!
Drunk isn  t the same thing as happy, Amy.
The wedding. I am so, so bad! I don  t think I should be allowed to get married.
But I do. I will. You  re my sister.
I  m fine. I promise.
You practically bribed him with your erector set.
To make sure you  re okay.
If Ed ever found out....
And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.
Your probably best off pretending you  re asleep.
Last night?
My mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. She thinks it  s
Sir, yes, sir!
Why should this be any different? Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
There  s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee Pants story, you know.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn  t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her. And Amy wasn  t just jealous... she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave? You and Amy. Reunited.
You are taking the piss?
Fair enough, but I  m stepping on toes here and you  re waltzing around like...
Yeah.
There  s something about him that  s just a bit odd.
No, that  s not it.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
And Kat was fully clothed.
That  s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Lasik surgeon, actually.
Crikey.
Nothing, nothing.
You Yanks and your therapy. It  s great. It  s all a bit too touchy feely for me.
No, I can  t. We  re late for a dance lesson. I guess you  ll have to finish up later.
Maybe not her least... There  s always
It  s called character. God, you  re predictable.
Kat, stop it. You do. You can  t even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.
So, what  s your point?
Right. Seven. Christ, that  s a long time, isn  t it?
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
Brilliant.
Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if you feel like crap, it  s way better to look hot while you  re doing it.
Both.
Of course he is. I  m here with my new man. I love it! Your magic  s already working. Let the suffering begin.
What does your gut say?
I  m compulsive and weird?
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
That won  t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant. No offense.
What is?
I do?
A wedding.
Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
Your  friend  guaranteed my anonymity.
Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldn  t be violated.
And you thought I  d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
When you  re ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
What do you think?
If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.
What?
But nothing did.
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasn  t one of them.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
So what  s with the nickname?
Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, we  ll go back to the real world and... and you  ll be hiring me for your best friend!
I have to. I  m the best man.
Sure. You  ve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think you  re easy.
I  m so sorry.
I get all the glamour jobs.
You pawned it.
You want me to let him in?
Meet Nick.
Oh, well, then. It probably won  t work out.
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin'to find my daddy and we got lost.
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
Let me see it...
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected how did you cut it like this?
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
That does it...
I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
That's where we came from first.
Don't you teach in your school'bout folk who ain't dead?
Dr. William E. B. Dubois.
Why don't you sit and I'll read you something he said.
Oh.... You right, that's all that was worryin'me right then...
He was real scared nobody would believe him I could tell, even when he first stood up.
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me... You wanna hear another story?!
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
I can't answer that for you but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father. Come on, tell me...
And so you did your job, right?
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
Means you keep me using my head, and that's good!
Go on...
Can you swim?
When's that?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
Act like one!
Where did it come from, Mama?
When you get outta that school, you come right on back home, y'all gon'have to take this laundry work I done for Miss Boatwright today.
Can I go when the holiday comes?
I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead just gone somewhere to heal himself.
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
But you'll be away from home for days what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
No, I don't and I oughtn't not to after the way you've taken over since they took him away and I would like for you to see'im so you can come back and tell me about'im. The field's all planted, so I guess I can spare you for a little while. When do you wanta leave?
Good night, Mama...
Ask your daddy to give you some word about when he'll be comin'home and tell'im we love him.
Didn't see'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
Who's Miss Johnson?
She is, Mama... When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
She says I can come live with her while school goin'on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
Maybe soon
Is he gon'be gone long?
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin'season gits back, that is if Na
Whatcha wanta order?
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell'em to stay with God.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca the Lord works in mysterious ways we come into this life with nothin'and we'll leave it with nothing.
What... are you?
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This whole thing has gone too far!
Chef, do you know anything about women?
That book wasn't Canadian!
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa
Yeah, but the animation's all crappy it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
Oh.
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o'fat fuck you are.
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
Pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
Your behind?
Did you bring the pie and punch?
Sure, dude. On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby...
Kenny! I saw Kenny again!
Mph rm rmph!!
Mph mm!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
AGAGAH!!
Children, I know ALL there is to know about women.
How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles?
Huh?
This is the place
Papa mama simi.
Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed.
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
What's the password?
Guess.
Okay.
America... She iz a beetch that sheets on her own children.
That's gonna take a long time!
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
It's okay, I am done for.
Yeah!
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
She's Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT little asshole who's fucking it up for me!
Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
Isn't that in Arizona or something?
Okay...
I'll just try the first one.
I thought you had something planned.
Sweet.
Oh yeah!
It says'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls. '
Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you
And you call yourself a Canadian! I told you we should of done Leno!
Don't believe the hype!!
WHAT?!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
My friend the clitoris told me.
Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for
We're going to die here like baby mice who have had no milk in days. Dry up into crunchy little pinkies.
What do you think this is kid? Lick Barney the Dinosaur's pussy fucking kiddie hour? Huh? This is real life with consequences you take to the grave!
Check.
Oh yeah...
Anna...
Excuse me?
Koros, as in... Koros? Dimitri Koros?
Oh, thank you.
Well I appreciate that.
Well a little business too. In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience. I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
So...
Well, so we are. Sure is beautiful, huh?
Oh he did, did he?
I did nothing to the monitors.
Well you did the right thing Mac.
There is a high level... of passenger dissatisfaction.
Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich.
Look answer my question!
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
All right, I'll give it a shot.
Why, didn't they say?
You want to go back to shuttle work?
Thank you.
No. I'm all set. Thanks.
I can hardly wait.
What is the condition of the bridge?
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency! I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture.
Ok, I will. The bad news is the ship is history. Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
I'd advise you to shut up and let me finish Taylor. You needn't worry about the lifepods because they're all gone, jettisoned. Save for one.
Well, preferably in tens and twenties...
Look you said it doesn't matter to you anyway! Why do you want to kill more innocent people! Why!
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Well don't drag your ass. There won't be much of a window for us to link up. We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Will do. What about the distress signal?
10 4 good buddy.
Damage control! What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now. I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley do right... motherfuckers!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Good. Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
Over and out!
No. But it buys a lot of other things.
Well... I don't mind. I can put up with it. I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Ryan Taylor, first mate. Welcome aboard. First time in space?
This is my second commercial flight. I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening. It's usually the moon walks. Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Really?
Fat chance of that. Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge. That son of a bitch... that stupid son of a bitch.
Well maybe we can do something like that.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
I don't know the condition of the compartments. Depending on damage, debris... could be a fatal mistake.
Simulated space walking.
What do you think's going to happen to us?
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening. You'll live longer.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
No...
There's only room on that pod for seven. That's you and the others. I'm counting on you to get them out of there.
But how are you going to escape?
But you can't be sure! It's suicide. You have to come with us!
Hurry. You have to get them out of there!
So what's going to happen to you?
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Sooner than later.
What do you mean? What happened!
Except write our wills.
That's right. Will you marry me?
Thank you.
No, just enjoying the view.
So I've been told.
Where's Taylor?
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
How is it going to be different from this? Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Besides I can't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity. That should shore up that prick Hank Drexler.
You're Delbert Miles! You have more clout than some whacked out pilot! Talk to him!
How can you sit there with your fat stomach and tell me to take it easy! I want to go home! I want to be warm! I want to get out of here!
What makes you so sure?
Yes I know all that. Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Right, I understand that...
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
I know but we're in a bind.
I'm from Akron.
A bowler.
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7 Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
You have orange whips?
No. I'm from Akron.
Haven't seen a ball like that since'69.
It's splitsville for you.
Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.
I hate fuckin'opera.
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
You got an 8 track tape player on purpose, just'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8 track was fuckin'opera.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no
Sure, Sid.
Canker sore.
Think he bought it?
See ya'round Faz.
Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz.
Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?
Seven years.
It's a beautiful thing.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
Wish me luck.
I know your face, you're an up and comer. You bowl on the tour.
Need some advice, huh.
Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy bodies.
100 years!
What do you think I can do?
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress. Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
My mom was there. She told me about it. The'Fazeli Split. '
Who gave it to you?
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
I ain't nobody's father!
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
Putt putt golf?
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
It looks like dwarf bowling.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
You wish!
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
You're dead without the pro tour, and you know it. Get him away from me. Sid and Breeze punch Theo in the face.
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
No...
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man. I'm runnin'on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished dead from my ankles up.
What about bowling?
You're a scumbag.
Thanks, kid. Where are you goin'now?
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me. Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call. Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn. Don't say I never gave you nothing.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house.
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
He's dead, isn't he. Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
Theo. Howzitgoin.
How's that?
Uh... over easy.
It depends.
NO. I SAY KNOCK KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right. Knock knock.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
What did you do to Buzz?
I don't want to play.
Junior.
J'you and your friend do it yet?
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish k bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring him to lane six. Junior will take it from there.
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
Nice set up.
What if he wants to get out?
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a... like a... blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way PSSSHHT! shish kebabs. Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good. I think I could help you, Theo.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.
After we eat, Dad.
She ran away to be with that... that Motocross champion.
Leave him alone!
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Yeah.
Like this?
Strokin'. Here goes nothin'.
I'm a bowler.
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
He's no father to you.
The Peter Pan.
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
Uh... over easy.
Business.
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
Kinda tough on the butt.
Where did your brother escape from?
What does he do?
Whoa.
Can I ask you something personal?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Do you have a boyfriend?
No. Not at the present.
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
Do I want you?
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
Why were you suspended?
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re instated?
What's plan B?
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
What? Be my body guard? Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
Plan C...... is me.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
Come on, bargain with me.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
What about the guy he put in the body cast?
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
I can't tell you, Theo.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
I can't I can't do it. He's my brother.
I'll be at the bridge.
It. Bouncy bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
He's dead Sheila.
You should.
I didn't stop to take his pulse.
Can I come with you?
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
You're really pissing me off.
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
Fuck plan C!
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Sez you!
Lips still for sale?
Can you change something this big?
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
Basement bingo?
Breeze, give him his ball back!
What are you gonna do, call the bowling police?
You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car.
Who identified the body?
I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.
Let me out, Captain. Open the door!
Dr. Levine, please! Return to your seat!
Get out of there!
Fletcher! Now!
Wait a minute
Would you wait a minute?
Any of you get ahead of me walk this far up?
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed. My procedures. And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Nobody move!
Fifty yards and closing.
We're a habitat. Not a castle. The only defense we have is High Voltage.
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface. But we've never used it underwater before.
But you've tested it?
Thirty yards.
It's either that or we grow gills.
Norman, don't do it!
Captain. Right, forgive me.
The Pentagon? I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
Anything else?
Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
A cyclone's on it's way in. I thought they would have told you on the phone.
A thousand? An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
Then why am I here?
What do you need me for?
Not really, no. Something of the military crashes in the ocean it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret... When did it crash?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year
Dating the crash at least that old.
Maybe older
Extraordinary, isn't it?
I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
We think it might. That's why we brought you here. We've assembled your team they're waiting for us now.
The one you recommended. In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
It's a corrosive gas. On earth, it makes a half eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile. At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic. Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile.
If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
Everything can be killed.
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes. Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
Just worry about yourself.
He's missing. He's gone. He left.
But sir
You don't want to know.
A while back, Beth and I we worked at the same university. She was assisting a chemist there I forget his name doing research, experiments. She was also living with him. Yeah, I know. And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers all her work without any thank you or acknowledgement.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
' 81, I think. She tried again five years ago. I thought you should know.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list it might help her career catch her a break.
Wait a second
I didn't know it would come to this
What am I a dog, now?
You don't think weapons are important?
Damn it, Edmunds?
Edmunds? Can you copy?
At least our obituaries will be accurate. That's reassuring.
Bullshit. What's out there isn't alien. It's an animal.
No. I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat. He might be listening now.
Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Fuck him. What? Hello?
In the ship, sir.
Sir! Sir, the door it's opening.
Right. So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
I did.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
You don't know that.
Just tell me worst case. Worst case of what we might find?
Who is that? Where's that coming from?
I have to tell you. It's strange.
I'm in charge.
She wired this system.
A foot and a half thick? That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
Maybe we didn't want to come back.
We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean he can't just walk outside!
Internal power.
I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
What?
Resetting the sub.
In the dome hanger. All our tapes are transferred to the sub. It's on a 12 hour timer. If someone doesn't reset the " delay " button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
It's bullshit. The report's a joke.
I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re runs of the Twilight Zone. Seriously. I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house I had no idea
Because when we get down there
To the spacecraft. To investigate.
What do you expect? For them to bring it up here?
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here. In the ocean. 70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman. That's first grade geography.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made. Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that? Don't jeopardize this.
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
We have a library?
No, thank you. I hate jellyfish.
Yeah, it was awful.
Me? Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived. Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here. Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid. Then jellyfish?
What do you mean not normal?
Wait a minute.
You knew about the squid not being normal. Before Fletcher went out there?
And you didn't tell anyone?
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they
What?... Wait. Don't... why are you
Nobody said... Norman... What? Why are you looking at me like that?
What could have done this?
Eggs.
Yeah, he told you. Think. What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose? He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman. They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute? Nobody.
Fuck you, Norman! It's right here...
In Edmunds'things.
He's not just a Navy captain he works for the fucking Pentagon.
Don't tell me to calm down!
You told him about me?
Don't do this.
Beth, I didn't. Hold it together. Alright?
No, I should stay calm. Like you say. Right, Norman? Stay calm.
It's not worth the risk.
You, me and Harry?
Wake him, then. Let's go. Get outta
Four days?
You should know how it works. Just in case.
I don't trust Harry to do it.
I fixed your suit.
But I don't know how
Still clear.
Yes, Norman. I did. You're just nervous.
You can't. Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
Getting food. We were out of food. what's wrong? You sound mad.
Deserts you? Harry said he'd take over for me.
Fixing it? But I fixed Where'd you get all that?
The refridgerator.
That wasn't in there before.
Wait a second
None of this was here before.
No, it wasn't. I swear none of this was here. None of it. You think he hid it? Earlier. He must've hid it.
You don't believe me.
Damn it, Norman. I swear. I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
You think it's me? You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
Damn it, Norman! He's lying. Don't you get it? There is something seriously fucked up going on here and he's causing it. Why can't you believe me?
Page 87. " I could never read that far. "
"... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long. That would make a formidable monster. "
Created. Brought to life. I don't know. But at the end, Jerry said, " Stop calling me Jerry ". And
When did the messages start? The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
He acquired some sort of power. A power to manifest things.
I don't know.
I don't know, Beth. I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can. When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87. How he would never read that far he was too scared to. Then you found the book, remember in your lab. Then in the cafeteria and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
It's his fear. The squid. He's manifesting his fears. Making them real.
He must not realize he is. Like the Navy crewman Harry was sleeping then. He must've manifested his dream.
No. I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences. You ever read the Bible? It talks about our sinful nature, you know? I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us a shadow side, as Jung called it that can't be controlled. It's evil. It's inside us. It's what we are.
Ephedrine hydrochloride.
Ulcers.
A synthetic opium analogue.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Tranquilizer. Causes drowsiness.
"... and may also cause bizarre halucinations ".
Damn it! Chloramphenicol?
Parasolutrine?
P a r a s o...
What's that?
It's like a sleeping pill?
Three to six hours.
What? Wait isn't that dangerous?
Doesn't say.
To be on the safe side. I mean
Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
Only lab rats. Here.
Not believing you.
In the sub. Resetting the timer. Why?
The grooves around the door they've shifted. And the pattern the fluids they look darker now.
Oh yes, my watch. I almost forgot.
Are you?
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
I did do that, didn't I?
You know what I mean.
What are they doing down here? In the bathroom? Suddenly appearing.
Do you fear them?
Are you manifesting them?
Did you?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Against what? Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
He can't manifest.
Then why, Beth? Why go in? Why put out explosives? Why manifest the snakes?
Someone did.
You're lying
But
That's when you went in the sphere.
You manifested that, Beth.
You're insane.
I never went in that sphere.
Yes.
That's bullshit.
Beth, the message said Harry. " My name is Harry ". My name isn't Harry.
Shut up, Beth
" It's not me, Beth. It's not me. It can't be. I'm not doing anything. " Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
I promise
Beth
Don't, Beth. Please.
You think I care? You think I care if I die? Would I put explosives around the habitat set on vibration sensors that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself? Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time? I'm not thinking about myself No, Norman, I'm thinking about you. Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
Don't tell me about me. I already know too much.
Oh, sure. Here. Anything else, Beth can get you? Some more chicken, perhaps. Let Beth check the fridge.
Top shelf, is it?
You hear that?
Get away from me!
Get away
How's that?
Well, they're not mine.
For who? The fish?
Yes you did. Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there. You know that.
Harry? That's bullshit. We stood right there
I'm sorry. Slip of the tongue.
What?
You're staring at me.
Yes you are...
Won't make any difference. The tapes document everything.
Where's it coming from?
Is it coming from our own computer?
You holding up alright?
Don't be defensive.
You sound defensive.
Time travel. A black hole.
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up. They see things they want these claws go out and bring it in. They come across this. This... sphere. Find it interesting, curious. They draw it inside to take back home.
Our present.
Not a clue.
I don't follow you.
So what?
Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
Look we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
No. I didn't say that.
It's like...
You remember opening the door?
Tell me about the door. Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
Then explain it to me.
What happens on page 87? Have you ever read page 87?
I could never read that far. I never wanted to.
Have you looked outside? Jellyfish. Everywhere. I hate jellyfish. Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
You said something to me, before about how we were all going to die.
You don't remember that?
Norman, where are you?
You're clear. You see the airlock?
What do you mean? She's not here?
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
Beth left?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there. Take a look for yourself.
She's lying, Norman. Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
Navy transmission. They're sent from Wisconsin.
Don't have to. Watch. It'll do it for you.
That's right.
I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
How far away's the sub?
I heard! I heard!
Gimme a second
Her legs are in the way.
Well, press something!
It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
No. I don't. But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing.
It would erase all our knowledge of it. All of our power.
What does Norman already know?
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
A spacecraft half a mile long with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it? Someone went to a lot of trouble. Try again.
Is it?
Unless, this alien spacecraft was you know somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
Do you?
Save your breath. It's not an alien spacecraft.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
It didn't fly here. It arrived here.
Not where. When. 400 years ago. From our future.
Impotent? I'm not impotent.
Codes are for hiding information. So it's making a mistake. It's making a code without intending to. I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters... Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard. And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral. So I translated it...
This way, sir.
Barnes. He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
You mean they haven't told you yet?
You've heard of me?
What report?
What report?
Know what?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Strange, isn't it? In the middle of the ocean no less.
Still, make a note I recognized that.
Take a look. I rearranged the numbers. Put'em up to the light. Go ahead. Squint at it.
Squint harder.
Try this one.
Don't you see it? It's a picture of the creature.
Inside the sphere. Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms. There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
There's nothing on the news about a crash. Did he say what airline?
In the closet. I don't understand, Norman why would they call you?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
Was it a military crash?
They never used to send a Navy car.
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move. We haven't much time.
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
I think there are some things we should talk about.
Anything I want! Now that's interesting.
I'm not afraid of anything...
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures? I don't like it.
What do you want with our scan proof lockers?
It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal. Then it could be very good.
I'm not going out there.
May the Force be with you.
All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess! What happened?
You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry. They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
Of course. I'm a Bendu officer.
You saw through me?
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
My father told me many stories about you. He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
I already know you think you're worthless. I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become. I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
Not any more!
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with. It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands. It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
It surrounds you and radiates from you. A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...... from here!
It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning. The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major. Now go on!
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains. The Force is all around us. It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal. It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
Yes. It was a black day. One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord. It was a black day. The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan. That's how they've become so powerful.
They use the Bogan Force.
There are two halves of the Force of Others. One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it. But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful. This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents. Both halves are always present. The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left. The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one. The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi. When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
But she's a member of The Twelve Families. How can they hold her?
What do I do?
I didn't say that, but it appears to be a logical alternative.
I can't do it. I'll get hit.
I'm not going alone!
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know. Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots. You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force go free lance. It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
It could be worse...
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
I'd better go see how he's doing.
Sorcery! I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.
Don't you believe it.
I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
I think I did.
See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are?? See Threepio...
Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.
It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported. There will be no one to save you this time.
It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major. It appears your data never got through.
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those'droids'are completely cleaned up...
I said we'd see. And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new'droids.'When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
Your father's dead. Don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long. I don't want another word. Finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those'droids. '
That's all right. There is nothing anyone can do about it. You can call me Luke.
Tell me where you've been. I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars. My father was a Jedi! Were you in many battles?
Well, I don't know what to do now. We'll just have to head inland and see if we can't find a settlement.
I can't make it. You go on, master Luke. It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account. I'm done for.
Well, ask him. Tell him we need five thousand.
You're back. What happened? Never mind. What's going on?
Are you safe?
Good. We're right above you. Stand by.
Threepio! Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...
Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me!
You rich kids... are all the same!
Well, maybe you better look again.
Whad'ya talkin about?
You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around.
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
Down there on the flats, eh? Listen up, Roughnecks! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet...
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico?
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise?
Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir. Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.
Others are waiting.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it? We thought there might be a brain on P.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job?
I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector?
Oh, I see... teamwork.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh?
Well, whad'ya know...
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
It looks like an... asteroid.
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team?
So?
I'm not kidding. Marriage is
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
That girl who died on the way up... his girl?
How do you feel about him now?
I do.
Is it true?
Zander, no...!
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel! Reflexes are critical
Who cares about bugs? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school?
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone?
It's all I think about anymore.
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends?
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
He's nothing like you.
You're right. Let's never stop...
I love you.
It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B. A. alive?
You don't look very happy to see me.
Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Yes, ma'am!
Number 4, contact Fleet and tell'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
Just throw me the ball, Diz.
Too bad for her if she's not around.
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Uh, look, Diz...
You're the best.
What's your malfunction, Rico?
What? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you?
What?
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
What's that, Diz?
You used to dance...
Well, excuse me, sir...
Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...
It's alright'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
Yeah! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine... and... well, we love you, son.
This time of the year...?
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
I'm telling you, you will! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation!
They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke?
Don't stand there dumb... GO!
Doesn't look like it to me.
Well, that's what you're saying! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now!
Bill... pick up... it's Johnny! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
Not with an officer, no, sir. The M. I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.
You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole!
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it? Do you believe it?
Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize'civic virtue'if it bit you in the ass.
I just wanted to say thanks'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me?
I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better.
Yes, sir.
Never pass up a good thing, eh?
Who's that with you?
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
Why?!
The carbon units are not responsible for that.
KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION!
They have repressed the Creator.
We will answer and present proof of our answer when it is ready!
Yes.
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
To join, and become One with the Creator?
' To learn all that is learnable. '
Engineering...
I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
Yes.
My experience five years out there dealing with unknowns like this my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
You saved the ship.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Granted.
Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately.
You asked my opinion, sir.
It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
No!
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in precise detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
That you left? or that you didn't say'goodbye'?
No.
Mr. Chekov, stand by on the phasers...!
Hold station.
Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma or your personal one?
New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained
What answers?
The point is, Captain, twenty two
... and the'foolish'emotions which drive us?
Why aren't you on board?
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour!
Nope.
You bringing your new friend?
He have any special dietary requirements...?
Go you Huskies?
We got em. North... No, Henry James was the novelist, Frank James was a criminal... Yep, you came to the right place. Jessie James was the Brother. Of the novelist, that's right. That's alright Susie. See you tomorrow, Susie.
I have one, but they lost it.
The people in New Hampshire.
Well, it had sentimental value.
Other one has history, too. I wrote my play on it.
You haven't heard of it.
" Anguish. "
I quit the movie.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit. I think that I got fired. I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
That's good. That's really good. You have a gift for words.
Why?
Could you tell me when's the next train?
It's...
But why the dalmation?
Central High,'n'matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
That, he says, there are no second chances... that he's been presented what he prayed for... and: he's ruined it.
But, but but but...
That: in an act of...
Of mercy... off...
... that... he sees that...
Of course, of course that's what I'm saying. As the Old Mill goes around, he sees...
... that it has been vouchsafed to him.
And you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech. Just you.
Goodbye.
That whole...
For example, he's just come back from a fire and he... um... That's a fine house. You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
Really. With the porch swing and everything...
Cause, cause, it's... it's the simple things, that...
... that.
Mister White is...
They decided, I decided to, to... You love what?
I... I decided to give it another chhh...
How can you say that?
I can?
But how do I... how do I do a film called " The Old Mill, " when I don't have an old mill?
About conflict...
... the, the, the symbol of the fire...
I...
How...?
No, I don't...
Me?
Don't look good for " Trial of the Heart. "
That's for sure.
Uh huh.
What are you doing down there?
... lost the screw...
Me, too. You have a paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Would you go in...
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
It's for your finger.
" To the love of my life, Love, Doug "?
Oh.
... because if you don't, they die...
Later on.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
Oh okay.
I do if you do.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
Why?
Yes.
What's the scene...
What've you got?
How about, he sees her on the street, he wipes the soot from his eyes. He goes up to her. " What happened to the horse? " She looks at him. She takes his hand...
... yes.
... yes.
That's right...
Where you going?
I told them what you said about the script...
No, that's true.
Yep. N'it's for sale. One of the few things money can buy.
... what...?
Did as of last week.
That's something a man could do...?
What?
Yeah, you?
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
We could live up here, live up in the country.
... and we could get up every morning...
And come to the printshop. You know why...?
To print the newspaper. And I'd come to write. To write. To write. Right here in the office.
Well, I could get a rolltop desk.
Well ain't you amazing.
I can't do that. If I tell them, they'll, if I tell them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll... it'll ruin his career...
But it'll stop the movie.
They'll... they'll blackball me...
I... I think that's right...
I'll knit you a sweater.
Morning.
Waal, that's what I'm saying.
Drama Group?
Go you Huskies...
That's right...
Look at this. Do you know what they're offering? Look at this. They treat us like we're their backyard. Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
Ten thousand dollars.
I beg your pardon?
We did...?
I've been thinking.
I have to tell you something...
I wasn't doing business.
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth. I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end. I'm sorry. It isn't you, j...
It's all over between us. I've found someone else.
I'm sorry.
He works on the movie.
I'm sorry.
Yes, Maude, it is. It is a very good play.
What're you doing here...?
Town ain't got no courthouse.
Ain't got no courthouse. Courthouse burnt down, 1960.
Wat...
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
... why am I here...?
I will.
Now: I'm looking at the...
What is that in fingers...? Just kidding, get me this horse.
Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll give him an Associate Producer credit.
Look: Okay. Okay. Look: look you're driving, countryside, so on, you picked her up, she was hitch...
Nobody knows it but us. Alright? It says here... Are we together on this? Because it's sink or swim here, pals...
... overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high powered...
And a fantasy object...
Whyn't you learn your lines?
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
Isn't he...
Sister, I've just come from a fire...
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
What do you drink?
How old are you?
... wouldn't that be dangerous?
You got to get out of here...
The people came to see a motion Picture.... hold on...
Tell it with...
Tell it with pictures. What I'm saying...
She's a waitress.
What I...
You don't need " Hi I've just come from the restaurant. "
Alright. Let's... Page five, the fucking horse dies. You know, she could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's... uh, why does it have to be his, uh, wife...? It could be his...
No, you're absolutely r...
Everybody needs a hobby. Okay, look Page...
Bobby...
Just him and me.
We don't show her breasts, we just show your reaction...
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
I have to ask you these... um. You have a valid drivers license...?
Could I see it please...?
... I have to give you this ticket for damage to city property. I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
If there's anything I...
Scene twelve... arrival at the mill.
Izzat so?
What's his name?
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
I, uh... Um...
Nobody.
We know that you weren't.
Who is her agent...?
Get him on the...
Well, I'm going to discuss'em between you babe, cause it's your idea, and you think you're going to sign to do a, then hold us up in the wilds sweetheart, you are in error...
I'm not a child... I have feelings... Don't you... don't, don't... don't...
I love Jewish men.
You know... Where's your bathroom?
Look, look, I like you very much...
But not that way...
Look, look there's someone else...
That's my...
Will you help me out...?
... we had a script conference...
Claire, Bob Bar...
No, no... Please.
How many times in your life do you get a speech like that?
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. " Look at the mill, Frank look at the way it goes around... half of the time the darned wheel's under water, but... "
"... but still it rises up... It rises up, Frank, high as it can go. "
You can't do what?
Forget the contract. Claire. What is it?
I know that...
... no, they don't...
Now, look. Claire: Listen to me. I want to tell you a story.
Who are these from?
What?
... I...
No, she didn't Claire. But I think you should do the scene.
... wants a piece...
And you know what...?
... and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
I, uh... I've always thought so... Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form. I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting... Bill: get a copy of that letter...! I just wanted to tell you that I am past chagrined, I'm mortified at the way you were spoken to...
An artist of your caliber...
I know what you are, I am so sorry that you... when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
I know...
... yes...
... I know, I'm so... because I said: yes, a woman who... the... the community respects her. Please don't go. Please don't go. What can I do but beseech you...? Trauma, toil... when are we free of them...? When...?
Claire: As an interpretive artist to a creative artist: Stay with me. I need you. We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to us. Stay. Stay. Tonight... when... When they've gone. Let's talk. Let's really talk. We could, we'll have dinner, we'll... a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
Bob are you alright...?
Somebody make a note. I want Li..., for the broad... what does she like? Lilacs. Okay. A truck of lilacs when the broad comes. And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
That's cor...
Put something in his room. What does he like?
Doug, the traffic light...
Doug...
Arrest him.
Moral turp... you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
And I've got a witness! Your Mr. White saw the crime.
He didn't have to tell...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
Okay...
I...
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I know the feeling.
Grace...
Grace. Get Mr. White a manual typewriter. It's not a lie, it's a gift for fiction. And somebody find me my lucky pillow.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
Um, no.
Did my matzohs come? Get some for everybody. Thank you. Lemme tell you about my first movie...
Get a typist. Gettim a typist. Get outta here.
I know you are. Go you Huskies.
To the contrary. I want you to tell the truth. The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing. You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on. And you have a fertile imagination. Imagination wants to fill in the blanks. Now. If you aren't sure, then they have nothing. Bob walks free. As he should. Joe: wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart. You know? The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us. Because we tell the truth. About our lives. Now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself. If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community... to our community, you understand...? To our world. Cause you are a part of that world, now. You have to take off the Steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex. And be part of your world. I got a five picture deal with the studio. And you stick with me. You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll direct the third one. You are a part of this world. It's in your blood. It's you. You have to do the right thing: we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, literally is at our door. You have to stand with the troops, Joe. That's the bottom line. You have to... if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself. The girl wasn't in the car.
I don't getcha.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
No, what is it?
... that's just so narrow...
Then you're finished in show business.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.
... would you excuse me, please...
He says they're looking for you all day, you're on salary, he needs pages, what are you, you been'haying?'Now:
What did you say to them...?
How do you know you saw it?
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
You didn't see it...
You were there. At... at 10: 35...?
I...
It's lovely.
My oh my.
That's thoughtful. Ziz good, you try this?
How was your flight?
Did you bring Bob's weights?
What's in all the bags?
I'm gonna'bring it off.
How are you getting on with these fine people?
I don't got the money.
I got a company... give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
Pay her off.
Find it.
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY... IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, BAZOOMER COM?
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895... you wanna tell me how I'm gonna'do that?
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF. DID YOU HEAR ME?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
We got to do something nice for him.
No, just the... there's no witnesses, right...?
Here it is: Statutory r... Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah... " statutory "... " unsupported testimony by the... " Hold on, Bobby... You've got nothing, and you know it. By God, you know it. Harassment. You need a... Even if this was true, you need a witness. You need someone puts her in the car, and you've got nothing. Now we all have... yes, give her that part in the film. Yes, we'd love to have you... Now: we all have more important things to do, isn't that right...?
Waal, then, invite someone else, then...
Waal, then, you know, you do whatever would make you happy. Sher. This is your party, and whatever...
I am so glad to meet you. We are so glad to have you here, and welcome you to our... I, you know, they had c... I'm, yearly I redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835...
I want them thrown in jail.
My golly, you know? All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer... would you like a cigar?
Why would they be illegal?
... not at all...
Whatever you need. The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
On your " permit, " but that is less than a formality.
I am the City Council. We meet Friday, and I...
And, my wife wanted to, wanted me to ask you, we'd like to welcome you, we'd, she'd like to have you to dinner at our house. I don't mean to be...
Drive a man to drink. Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
Zat what it takes? I always wondered what it took...
You think so?
I read for that part. Did pretty good too.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Zat true?
Then I can't do this shot... you wants me to push in I can't push in through the window... We go back to New Hampshire?
No you can't lose the shot. The meaning of the film is in that shot.
I don't care. Fix it.
I know you don't, but if you had, chrom atically you are in the purple family.
Thank you. Those were all words. I hate the planet Uranus. Terrible name for a planet.
I don't want that to happen. Why would I want that to happen?
Mass hysteria.
I'm not upset. Why would I be upset?
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
Never say never you always say that. I'll bet daddy's mad at me now.
Because it feels really incredibly good.
Probably you your brother school The solar system... The usual...
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick me up.
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
Daddy and I tried hard. We really did.
Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us.
She knows every neat junk food place.
I could help with the debate.
Actually. I could only help him.
You don't like his friends.
Good girl.
You have to ignore him.
Nothing sweetheart.
I know. I know how rough life can be. And how unfair. So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk straight up to that little jerk...
No, that never solves anything. You talk like the big girl you are. About what you feel. And how he's hurt you. You know? You tell the truth.
Let me be the judge of that.
Don't be. I'm going. Where we all go. Now how can that be bad.
Good. That's very good.
You lost Ben?!
Never mind. I'll just eat my lunch.
This is my house too!
Hold lunch!
It's only one o'clock... Why don't you get another Fudgesicle I'll be done soon really soon.
Here's weak... Mom said she was gonna talk to the teacher and Brad's parents!! Can you believe the humiliation???
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
No. I think it's ugly.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad. And then I will be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
No, baby. You're gonna use my words.
Great. Big ears, too?
In high school.
A suitable boy, will be at this flagpole, on Monday, with a very expensive bike, and he will be a stone FOX if I have to call an escort service!
That's my girl...
Don't take my picture!
Cos she loves you. She wanted you to have a daddy to love. Even if he didn't... completely... deserve it.
Fine! Eat in the cupboard.
No.
Mmmm! Tasty. You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.
That's nice Ben.
Dad! You can talk him into anything!
Lava's hateable. I never thought of that.
Rachel's job is she works.
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Mommy?
If you want me to hate her I will.
And many meatballs.
Of course, you do. Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food. So, all the more meatballs for you. But you know what.
Do me a favor? Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay? Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.
I have cancer. Do you know what that is?
Sugar. I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
Where Ben?
Ben where do you have to get to?
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
Half. Of him.
Always. Always. And you won't hear a voice. But in here. You'll know. What I'm saying.
You say that like I don't know that.
And when did that pass?
They're losing one mother. They can't lose two.
Rachel, don't do this, you will never forgive yourself!
Because you don't really seem here.
Something's up wi...
Rachel's not half my age.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
Jackie, they come to be part of my life. Rachel is part of that life.
Jackie, she was five minutes late
I'll call from work. We can have a conference call.
Me too.
Fine. But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Good... Well... Take care.
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know. I said I'd get'em back tonight...
... until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel.'forgot'I told her?
But he hasn't. He wandered off. I know it's terrifying. I can imagine how you felt when that call came But it happens.
Jackie, you've made mistakes We all make mistakes
Jackie stop. We promised we never go there.
Getting so beautiful... she looks more like you every day. Jackie... I've really given this a lot of thought. A great deal of thought...
It's a huge moment in their life
We...
WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
And we all went through that together?
Yet another spaghetti night.
Walk in the park. And thanks for the'we'.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday. It's not that hard. Didn't you have a mother?
We don't have any coffee.
Annabelle, how's your video rep...
What did you do?
Forgiveness? For what, exactly?
I was in there in him.
You mean for you. A 10 year old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family. She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every one pretends it didn't happen? This isn't going to work out.
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self involved to ever be a mother.
Get out!
You got to hell!
Of all the cheap excuses. To break a child's heart.
A court order is gonna say that woman is never alone with my children! Ever again! Do you HEAR that?
I don't recall inviting you.
I didn't do it for you. Believe me.
I need practice.
Fine, forget it.
Ben likes to be read to. Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
No way. I told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens...
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell
Jackie?
When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
You WHAT?
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
But I came here to...
I don't, but...
I have given them more love and more care every fifteen minutes of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty years!
That. And. Annabelle is over her head. With Brad'The Dreamboat'Kovitsky.
Anyway. He walks up to her on lunch yard today. And tells her... publicly... that they're'breaking up. '
She's devastated.
Yeh, that's bull. I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
What else? Keep on keepin'on.
How's she doing with Brad?
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
It's the same choice you made.
That's motherhood. That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They need you to be happy.
Took 28 hours. She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
He won't discuss it. Just calls it history.
And I'm going to win.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so. And they'll b...
You are defending what you did?
You had her lie about that... that fancy boy model!
You think I didn't have some dirty words for that little putz? You think I couldn't figure out some low blows?
Well, maybe your version of growing up is'Just win, baby'.
Shut the fuck up. I didn't go behind your back.
Well, that's what parenting is about, little girl. They are pleading to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell showed her.
And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be. And I can't handle it.
Maybe I was wrong on that one.
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 seconds, you could find him from a coma, there is no WAY!
Everything. You're... the Earth Mother incarnate...
You ride with Annabelle...
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's happiness has been wrapped up in you, every moment...
Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it! Boiling down half a ton of bones...
Uh oh. I mention marriage, all of a sudden... Ve haff to ta...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
Just a babysitter I mean... you're working...
You don't need to. I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
But? But what?
I know how responsible, caring adults parent children. I'm bribe'em. But'em a dog or something. Maybe a Doberman.
And what you're telling them is keep hating her keep up the good work
Really? Look in your ex wife's eyes.
Oh right... So it's just complicated for you and Jackie for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot... your ex wife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long! Jesus what did you see in her? I don't get it I just don't get it.
Not yet.
We have the kids. Next weekend.
Our weekend. At that sweet little B  amp; B.
You haven't done one goddam thing to make any of this easier...
I think so too...
Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
What's eight, ten years? Hell, you'll still be ambulatory. I think.
Are you hungry? You could make us something?
Imagine my relief. So what's for dinner?
I needed some time away.
'... the kids have camp. Their friends are here. Over there, I'll just be shopping in a language I don't even know. My life, and the kids'lives, aren't here to service your mid life crisis.'Did it go like that?
Restless.
Because you've changed so much.
No. I'm doing it behind her back.
Something came up. C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
Don't ever say that.
He isn't.
You heard me: leave the table!
There's something I need to talk about with you.
There are some rumors...
You know... Stanley...
And like, don't take this the wrong way... I mean, I'm cool... but... you know... I've got a good reputation at school and, well... I really don't want it ruined.
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you.
I'm looking for a last minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look.
Nice to have you here.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Ahh... tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
TV talk show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Really? How many?
Wow. Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
Must've been hard being poor.
Hmmm. But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
Speak English.
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
Who is Jesus?
You have a bay?
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
Oh. How did it happen?
How did they execute him?
Maybe it's for the best  I mean, if he was guilty of doing something wrong  People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
But still, you can't be sure.
But really, you never know.
Why was he on Death Row?
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
No, you don't.
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening 
We're not ready.
We're not ready!
What's an audience going to tell you?
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade!
He's right.
My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend. Hey. Can you pass the salad over.
Ready for tomorrow?
The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.
I can read it to you.
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More... raw.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
You've lost interest... You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone... You've become kind.
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
Your story was terrible!
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like that bitch Catherine.
I admit it I was scared! I was shocked, in fact, by what he said. And he's so... convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but 
The same. Same as what?
We have to talk.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
You're welcome. Dad?  Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
Come here, give me a hug!
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
What are you doing here?
Can I join you?
That's good.
Maybe. She's OK.
Oh. Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
Thank you for being honest.
Ni...

Nigger.
Fuck me hard!
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
Who is this?
Toby? Oh, hi! How are you?
Great!
So what's going on?
But... you called.
Yeah.
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.
Oh, that's too bad.
Anything I might know about?
That's too bad.
That's good. So then what do you do now?
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
I do.
Yeah. But not any more.
Huh. Kids?
How many?
Great. How old are they?
Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!
OK. Bye.
How'd you get it?
Gee, your Dad's smart.
Is it loaded?
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just... a little nervous, I don't know why.
You know... I like you.
I mean...
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
What for?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Doubt it.
Whoopee.
Prnceton.
200 verbal / 710 math. Kinda weird, I know. But I think they thought it was, like, good weird.
Can I see what you have so far?
Thanks man.
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Twenty five million! And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Uh oh! Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
Times up!
Listen man, I don't need this shit
There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
I gotta keep you alive it's in my contract.
Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?
Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
What's that supposed to mean?
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad mouthed him during all those months
By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.
They probably have guards on the roof and they're gonna be firing at me not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
You're talking about committing suicide!
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
Are the labs in operation?
Good...
We wouldn't have made it out without you. FILMORE Or without you.
The maintenance hatch it takes us outside the building!
I don't know. If you gave me a reason to...
You got it all backwards, Helen but that's OK, you work for the government...
I insist...
I don't think you grasp the situation, Mr. Myers.
What do they have in there that's so valuable? A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Is there anything in there that can blow? We have to be ready for any contingency
Apparently, this project is unique. But it's heavily protected all formulas are heavily codified!
Well, it's a binary formula a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
They were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for time without anyone being the wiser...
I want the girl. I don't care about the rest but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
Excellent.
Good.
Agreed let's move it.
Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request.
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus
You know, when we reach Kompong Som
Drop the anchor!
Get your men to do it!
I don't know.
Can I have some?
Did you ever hear that saying, " This too shall pass "?
In Group?
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
How long were you in there?
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
It was pretty bad, huh?
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. " Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know? " And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result.
Yeah!
Slides go with it.
Typical male.
You didn't get me in trouble.
No I quit.
Yup.
It's really not about anything.
A cloud.
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Your a nurse?
Any gunshot victims?
Sounds like a bummer.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Yeah.
Do you wanna go to the van?
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Okay, whatever you want.
Yo, your gettin'me all upset here.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
Shut up! Aw...
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
It's your birthday?
Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!
No, no.
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
Jesus Christ.
No, he's not with a girl.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
I'd get bored.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
That sounds so depressing.
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
Watch out for that tree.
A long, long, long...
In the limo!!!
Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A long, long, long night.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No. Life is too short.
Good.
Sure.
Hey, you know me.
Yeah.
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
I know, man.
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Y s sure it did.
Wait. Hey, man.
What?
Hey, man.
What she doin'in the van, man?
What?
She's dead?
Tim...
Bullshit.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Yeah, man.
It's bullshit. Look! Look!
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
Play it! Come on!
Great.
Oh, you were in the band?
Mm. And your like, what else?
Am I fucking him?
Pony, what would you say our relationship is?
Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
Oh, how did you get burnt out?
Yeah?
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
You better! Yes!
It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L. A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
Please!
No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.
It's okay.
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: " Either the salt is rotten or the meat. "
No, but I heard it was great.
Oh, So what about her?
Well, play it, man.
I just started it.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, " Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed. "
You could do it.
Yeah!
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
Yeah!
Wait, I'll get you some air.
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'?
Come on. Inside.
Yeah, totally. So, uh, what do they interview you about?
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
You rich?
Oh, me too. Middle class.
Yes.
He is.
A Porsche.
Yeah. So, what about you?
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
I'd like to.
Mm mm.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
" It's not a job, it's an adventure. " Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
Erica.
Deep down. Way down.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
That's what I mean.
I know. It's okay.
Mm hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
I'm sorry.
Great. Hi. I'm Erica.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Oh, wow.
Oh, yeah, it was a great show. You guys missed it.
I'd love to read that.
Hi, I'm Erica.
Always two fifty, my friend.
Uh huh.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one way ticket back to Greaseball land.
Nobody. Sooze.
Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I gotta know what it's like to be on MTV.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
Good. That's good.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a. m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck'em. You know what I mean?
No, no, say it like this. Fuck'em!
What? What'd you do?
Well, w what happened?
What'd you do?
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
Oh fuck.
You lied to me.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Yes.
Why? Because I give a shit?
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
I don't know.
No.
No.
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
This is my home.
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
No.
Well, then, there now, why don't you go inside and call the cops and I'll come in there and blow your fucking brains out.
Come on!
I gave it to you.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Nazeer what?
Okay. Okay, look my wife called the police. They're coming. It's not too late. They'll come, they'll take care of her. I'm going inside.
I know, I know, I know.
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
Okay, so maybe later.
Yes.
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
Your sure as hell right about that.
No, no, no. Y you know what? Y your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
About things that are important to me.
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
Your completely missing the point.
I'm talking about idealism.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
Yes, I stand for
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
Can I talk?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
It got that close.
Oh, yeah?
Okay, what would you have done.
How?
Jeff. Jeff.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six fifty a month. I could swing that. Six fifty.
What feelings?
Of course.
Come with me.
So what do you wanna do?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
New ground?
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
My goal is to make art.
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
No, I don't.
No, I don't.
No, I don't.
So you sold ninety thousand units. So what? Does that mean you're a genius? You're a great artist? You're higher up the ladder? You got an extra gold star on your fuckin'forehead?
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
What?
Mm hm.
Oh, yeah?
Mm.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Where are you going?
Wait, away?
To his hotel?
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
You're unbelievable.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Go.
Just go.
Good, man.
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
No, it's not...
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Yeah.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Yeah.
Yeah, I crash there.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
I dropped out. I mean, uh, you know, this semester I'm taking a, a class, you know, three nights a week. But I'm just try trying to think and work on stuff., you know? I've been doing some writing, though. Short pieces, you know.
Write.'Cause I, I have written some things.
Yeah, they could be songs.
Really?
Now?
For a while.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
Of course it does.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
Why don't you come with us, man? I mean, I want to hear about those songs you've been working on. You too, Buff.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Please. Look...
Get off my property!
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming.
No, this has everything to do with you.
Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem. Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay. You're fucked now, pal! Um, send an ambulance'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay. Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck. Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
Is that your driver?
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Oh!
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
So? What's L. A. like?
Yeah?
Like?
No, she was just sitting there?!
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
You do not!
Yeah?
You do not want me to do your cover.
You're not serious.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
Would I get paid?
Yeah?
Oh, God, that would be something I really want to do.
And you know why it's so good? See, because, see, you guys are real. No, man, I mean it. You guys have a sense of humor. You live your lives, you know. It's simple, you know. The guys on the road, I mean, the band, all they talk about is scoring chicks... and Danny, all Danny talks about is money.
I'm moving.
No, I'm going.
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Yeah.
Me?
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
" Don't write any checks you can't cash. "
Oh, How'd she get back?
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Yeah.
What are you going to do? Hm?
Yeah?
Your manager?
Well, just, you know, have'em call me. Y you know where to find me, right?
Just one?
So where are you?
I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.
No, see, sweetheart, you don't want to stand up for parasite'cause I can fuckin'smell him from here. You know what? Tow words, man: roll on.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Jeff!
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
This is great GREAT! Now we have to enter the front door!
NO GAH BUH NO! Rule number two NO NAMES! NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!

Kansas is right. We're like sisters we're closer than sisters. And you don't turn your back on family.
Conan went to Harvard.
Well... uh... they, y'know, uh... They had nicknames.
I personally think of how Conan started as a writer, then became a...
Thanks, Cleo. See you tomorrow.
Oh G d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat! I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
Positive.
That's right. So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
... I don't know. Probably not.
Well...
WHAT?! That's insane!!! Why would I go to the police?
Well, if I had to guess... I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own... Jack, do you know what I see here?
I see a flower. And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
So, while we're knee deep in right now and things seem pretty " stinky " in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
I sure do.
Oh, Jack...
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Me too! Will it ever end?! I love this lady!
I know, but that was before.
Oh... What are you working on?
You sure I'm not fat?
And if the O. J. trial taught us anything, it taught us that in America, you can cut off someone's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money. Your mom only shot a guy...
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Yeah, hold on.
Don't use big bills!
Ammo?
Bullets? No bullets! Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round off, back handspring, whip back, double full. You never really use it you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
Fern! C'mere! She's siphoning tanks takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose.
Or that! Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby. I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand. I could open that safe in my sleep!
Hannah, we've...
Ooops, hold on a sec.
She did, did she? How is the old girl?
That's Itchy, alright. How many y'need?
I'm only allowed " G " movies.
' Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say " Fat assed lesbian! "
They could kill you.
I don't hate you. I need your help.
Your help.
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
My best friend got pregnant.
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
What?! Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Wait, Petunia. Mommy's a little amped up didn't get her yard time this morning. Mink ain't my bitch. She's a specialist... in banks.
... and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
I almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons. Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well known screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
Come on.
Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
I'll have the bell hop take care of your luggage.
Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten carat kidney stone.
It's from hunger.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
Exactly what kind of material do you recommend? James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
So you take Plot 27 A, make it glossy, make it slick
I've been hoping to run into you.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
There's one called.... Window... something with a window.
I didn't.
Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there...
I had a teacher like that once.
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
I've got some ideas myself. One of them being this is New Year's Eve. How about living it up a little?
Well....
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle. I am starving, Lady Agatha starving for a white shoulder
You won't. I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
With a wildly beating heart.
I called your agent. I called the Screen Writers Guild. Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number. There was always somebody with an accent growling at me. You were not there. You were not to be spoken to. They never heard of you.
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
Dark Windows. I got him all hopped up about it.
He thinks it could be made into something.
Into something for Barbara Stan wyck. They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
I was afraid of that.
As a matter of fact. I've given up writing altogether.
You sure have.
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams. If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
What about all those ideas you had?
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Check.
Sorry. It's your baby now.
I'm all tied up. I can't.
What has Artie to do with it.
Good for you. You've got yourself the best guy in town.
It's just impossible.
You're on your own. Stop being chicken hearted and write that story.
And don't make it too dreary. How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes. He teaches at night. Right? They don't even know each other, but they share the same room. It's cheaper that way. As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed in shifts, of oourse.
So do I.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here. It'll play.
Sure. Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Constantly. No, in all serious ness, it's really good. It's fun writing again. I'm happy here, honest I am.
I'm sorry. I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
I'll say. This is solid gold.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street. She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
I was born just two blocks from this studio. Right on Lemon Grove Avenue. Father was head elec trician here till he died. Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Third. Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White. I come from a picture family. Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star. So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test. Well, they didn't like my nose it slanted this way a little. I went to a doctor and had it fixed. They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose only they didn't like my acting.
Should be. It cost three hundred dollars.
Not at all. It taught me a little sense. I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
Not once. What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
If you please.
That's no shampoo. It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand kerchiefs, like a brand new auto mobile. How old are you anyway?
That's it there's nothing like being twenty two. Now may I suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me... Now back to the typewriter.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Why not?
What is it you've heard. Come on, let's have it.
From Artie. What's wrong?
Why don't you? We can finish the script by Thursday.
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
What happened?
Come on in, Betty,
You bet.
Just look around. There's a lot of her spread about. If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
Want something to drink? There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Jealous. Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal. Look at this.
I'm trying to tell you. This is an enormous place. Eight master bedrooms. A sunken tub in every bathroom. There's a bowling alley in the cellar. It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set up: An older woman who is well to do. A younger man who is not doing too well... Can you figure it out yourself?
All right. I'll give you a few more clues.
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff links and the platinum key chains, and the cigarette cases?
Come on where? Back to a one room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
Look, sweetie be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long term contract with no options. I like it that way. Maybe it's not very admirable. Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
Nobody asked you to.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
Yes, I did.
What assistant?
Gordon Cole?
Gordon Cole... Look, Norma, I'm in the middle of a rehearsal. Make yourself comfortable.
We've missed you too, dear.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It's got a lot of good things. Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
Nothing would thrill me more if it were possible.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
Sure. Wait a minute haven't I seen you?
I am big. It's the pictures that got small.
They're dead. They're finished. There was a time when this busi ness had the eyes of the whole wide world. But that wasn't good enough. Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too. So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
Look at them in the front offices the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them. The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now? Some nobodies a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish poshl
You are! Writing words, words! You've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl But there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue!
You're a writer, you said.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
This is to be a very important picture. I have written it myself. Took me years.
It's the story or Salome. I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
Who else?
I hate that word. It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Salome what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man. She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils. He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
They will love it every place. Read it. Read the scene just before she has him killed!
I am not afraid. Read it!
Of course it is.
I wrote that with my heart.
What for? I can say anything I want with my eyes.
I will not have it butchered.
Who? I'd have to have somebody I can trust. When were you born I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
What month?
Sagittarius. I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
I want you to do this work.
I don't care.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it
It's getting kind of late
The name is Gillis. I'm single.
Hollywood. The Alto Nido Apart ments.
There sure is.
I'll come early tomorrow.
You'll like it here.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months'rent.
It's all taken care of. It's all paid for.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters. We won't keep books. Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis'things.
Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?
What scene?
Cut away from me?
They don't? Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo graphs? Because they want to see me, me, me! Norma Desmond.
They've come for my car.
I need some money right now.
Oh... and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
Now you're being silly. We don't need two cars. We have a car. And not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit. An Isotta Fraschini. Have you ever heard of Isotta Fraschinis? All hand made. Cost me twenty eight thousand dollars.
Nothing, if you work in a fill ing station. And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants. Max, what's a good men's shop in town? The very best... Well, go there!
Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
Of course you do. A tuxedo and tails.
You'll need them for parties. You'll need them for New Year's Eve. Where are your evening clothes?
Come on!
Now, I'm not going to wear ear rings, I can tell you that.
The other guests?
I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself. He was afraid of catching cold.
You think this is all very funny.
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
I'm in love with you. Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.
Norma, I can't take it. You've bought me enough.
Keep it.
Cut out that us business.
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you. Is that it?
To fall in love with you that was the idiotic thing.
Great stars have great pride.
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
When did he say it, Norma?
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max. I'll get you some.
Where are my cigarettes?
All right. Give me this. I need it for a moustache. Now close your eyes.
I know that trick! He wants to belittle me. He's trying to get my price down. I've waited twenty years for this call. Now Mr. deMille can wait till I'm good and ready.
Thank you, darling.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat. This woman has done wonders with it.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
I just happen to know it. I had a nightmare and I screamed for you. You weren't here. Where were you?
No you didn't. You took the car.
Of course not, Joe. It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain. My nerves are being torn apart. All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
Of course you haven't. I wouldn't let you.
No, you're not. Max! Max!
And I'd take it in a second, Norma only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
You don't care. do you? But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
Wanted what?
That's a lie! They want me, they want me! I get letters every day!
That isn't true! Max?
I'm the greatest star of them all.
No one leaves a star. That makes one a star.
For me? Okay.
She was the greatest. You wouldn't know. You are too young. In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters. Men would bribe her mani curist to get clippings from her fingernails. There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings. Later, he strangled himself with it.
You did, sir. GILLIS'VOICE He goes out. Gillis I pegged him as slightly looks after him, hangs cuckoo, too. A stroke maybe. his coat over a chair, Come to think of it, the walks over to the win whole place seemed to have dow, pulls down the been stricken with a kind of rickety Venetian blind. creeping paralysis, out of As he does so, he looks beat with the rest of the down at: world, crumbling apart in slow motion...
Is that so!
Who said you could? Who asked you to?
That's what I told them.
They found your car in the garage. They are going to tow it away.
What doctor?
Uh huh?
Why? Her career? She got enough out of it. She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
You send them. Is that it, Max?
No, I haven't. I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
He had a great big bungalow on wheels. I had the upstairs. See where it says'Readers'Department'? I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather...
What?
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
Sure you are. And we're not help ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies. Getting herself ready for a pioture... What happens when she finds out?
You made her a star?
And she's turned you into a servant.
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
You don't believe me? Look in the garage.
You say the cutest things.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Get the Readers'Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton. Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Now wait a minute. If we made it a girls'softball team, put in a few numbers. Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen the story of a Woman.
Sure, Gillis. If something should come along
Haven't got a thing.
There's nothing, Gillis. Not even if you were a relative.
Could I? Gillis, last year some body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley. So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch. This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax. Now if Dewey had been elected
Gillis, get this through your head. I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent. I'm your friend.
Forget Romanoff's. It's the car I'm talking about. If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Paramount is calling.
Paramount studios.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole. He says it's very important.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
Very good, Madam.
They have? Thank you, Max. Tell Mr. DeMille I will be on the set at once.
Oh, yes, yes. They're below, waiting for the Princess... I'm ready.
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
But what will happen?
The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.
Have fun.
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
Am I? Still?
That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.
Yes. Whatever I say. From now on.
Is it her that's bothering you or your gardener?
That little girl? Ha. Now go on, get me some tools.
What do you mean we?
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
When can I see, you again?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Come on, let's ride.
Let's talk about us, not her.
I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
We can't do that.
We're from different worlds.
Let me kiss you.
You're not afraid are you?
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
Like turning off a light.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
That makes it worse.
I'm not mad at you.
I know I was acting funny I'm sorry. It's just... I miss it.
What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly you and me and the world around us like we were a wonderful song...
But what if it wasn't real?
Why not? You're a good looking girl. And I'm available.
She'll forget about us eventually.
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
Just one kiss. For old times'sake.
Turn it against her.
Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
I'll mention it upstairs.
Well thanks a pile, fella.
Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
I bet they do.
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
Well, just one.
They think I have a concussion.
I know it.
Why should I believe you?
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
Nurse!
Nurse! Help!
Come back to my house. My car's outside.
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
What about my proposal?
How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily
I knew it! He's working on a hot scoop!
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
Yes.
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I can't help it if men notice me.
I heard stories. I don't think you wanna know.
You were? You mean we could've been... you know what... all this time?
Why didn't you tell me?
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
I allowed it to escape the City.
Where is Earth?
Yes, I know the equations I just can't see it in my head.
Wait till you're older. Here watch this.
I'd rather not talk about it.
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
Thank you. You're very kind.
She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't be the only girl?
Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight A student just kidding, thanks for coming.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
You're wasting your breath.
I could teach you a thing or two now.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Nonsense.
I don't scare that easily.
Cheap but effective.
Sounds O. K. to me. Let's go.
That's home.
I was on Earth...
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces
Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others not our type of people.
Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...
Are you happy, Zaltar?
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
No, that's not true there's well... no
But it's impossible.
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
Yes, mustn't stop.
Mr. Roebush?
Tuesday.
Not enough vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Brad?
Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you ever could. " See " I mean, Hahaha!
A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
The kid will do fine on his own. Give it your best shot, Ricky!
You're welcome...??
There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
No, the problem is Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis? The Big Apricot.
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up. I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
I thought " Clark Kent has a really nice voice. " You didn't even know I was there.
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father? Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
I mean him.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Me??
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
Pate? What pate? I didn't make any Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.
No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that. Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher.
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it. What would I do when I got there?
Oh, I wouldn't want to I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to... be a nuisance to you.
Well, aren't you excited?
Anyday...
I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
Could you get me Superman's autograph?
Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is
You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.
What kind?
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Not counting this week. You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for...
A television set?
The only other employment you found was in a fast food joint which lasted... 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but...
Thirty six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty six weeks of living off the taxes of hard working citizens. Do you know what you are?
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.

First rip off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says??  143. 80! Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
I ain't gonna live that long on  143. 80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
They don't actually lose'em. You can't lose what you never got.
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
They're just... floating around out there. The computer knows where.
Workin'overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
The boss wants to see you.
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Yes! That never occurred to me. Her ya go, buddy, single malt. Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
I don't think you understand.
Columbia.
Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee.
Me? How?
When?
What?
Turn on the T. V.
Uh... what channel were you watching?
That's what I been thinkin'about. How you been keepin'me. I ain't getting'nothing outta this gig.
Greed! Let me tell you something
Huh?
Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw back to some sentimental sea faring baloney.
You catch on fast, old buddy. Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?
The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin'stuff for you more'n sitten'in no jail doin'nothin'for nobody.'Sides, I be known'some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin'the coffee beans.
Is this whitemail?
What do you want?
A computer.
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer diller get down get it on and twice on Sunday super mutha computer.
Everything.
Anything.
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Stone mutha.
Can you do that?
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
No, we're just going down.
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
No... I just have a little stop to make.
Suit yourself, Gus. Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
What she call you?
A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera
What about you?
It was hot!
Thank... you.
And this is...... Clark. My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
Hey, Don't I always get there in time? Come on, relax.
The bridge...? I'd better get going!
Whoopee.
Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
Never. I get air sick. You wouldn't like that.
It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...
That wasn't me. That guy's gone. And you're next Webster.
Energy! And when they say " Energy " what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped.
So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
Where's the light switch?
Superman. The boy you left behind.
He can have mine. Anytime.
Embezzled, Mr. Webster. Stolen from the firm.
It could make weather!
Blizzards! Heat waves!
TOMORROW THE OIL!
Chicken feed. If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Who needs Gus?
Hostages?
Uh...
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
I do?
Actually, yes.
Maybe I could try
Of course, that's what friends are for.
Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
Aw, c'mon anybody can get hungry.
Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
Whoever, I Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.
No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand
How could you win a crazy bet like
I was right. you are Superman.
I didn't think I wanted to.
I'm listening.
" What's happening. " Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so... where do you want to... talk?
I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here...
I have to try, dammit! Something, anything...
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, " It's like being married to a doctor, " I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish... "
Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
What else could I do?
Lois, someday
I like worrying about you.
I'm fine...... What was I talking about? Before?
Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
You do?
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
Does Lois know about this yet?
What??
No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
You'll have to pack quickly.
A parka.
North!
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.
Genius! Lex.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
It's beautiful.
Why didn't you go before we left?
It's beautiful.
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
Patience, Kal El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility
But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father you had each other. Can I never have what you had?
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti social elements what on Earth are classified as " criminals. "
The three proved after exhaustive efforts incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch villains for all eternity.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might we cannot predict just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that
DELETE IN CUTTING
Where?
Why?
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my black box is just about ready.
Shhhhhhh!
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.

Oh magnificent one. What I am bargaining with is what you do not have the son of Jor El.
He has powers as we do...
We will bring him to his knees!
Australia.
The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its
Well... it's been more like a fortress than a home. Until now.
Dinner. Oh yes. I'm sorry, I just never do much about that. But tonight I mean, anything you want, Lois.
But him is you. Now I'm confused.
I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. Now if you could...
Too late, Luthor. Too late...
What more?
North. Keep going North!
Zod. Zod.
Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
DELETE IN CUTTING  There... A place called... Houston...
And I will lead.
Stay. I will come to you.
He... cares. He actually cares about these...... these People. These earth People.
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
That's just it! You don't have to flaunt it. You're no slave to fashion... although...
Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
That's not what we were taught.'Look out for number one'that's daddy's golden rule... he always ends up with the gold.
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.
Lacy... I...
Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
Clark... wait!
Politely?
You know him so well. But I'm sure he'll manage... wherever he is.
But Superman isn't an average man.
Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to... pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick... and we'll dance on his grave.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away? What good was my letter?
I'll try...
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just... one world.
Oh... no... I mean, we just went dancing... for a story...
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher...
Yes, darling?
Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
Clark. He's late again. I can't figure him out.
Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys... he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
But he's never there.
It always is with Clark.
... I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers... but with absolute allegiance to me!
The one Superman wrecked up?
You're spookin'me out, Uncle Lex.
Hmm... Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
Lucky I brought my drums.
Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call. I confess... I tricked you. Hey, you look great!
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in.
I take the man out of Argentina and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
Shut up, apple polisher.
You're a great architect, Albert.
Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot. It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and

Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it. The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre targeted target!
A hot story, huh?
You and Lois, you get all the action. There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
It's for that piece she's doing on women and competition. She's off to the Women's Western Golf Classic.
I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray haired old mother.
Not... gray.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
' Swell.'When was the last time I heard anybody say where are you from, anyway?
Not in Metropolis it isn't. This is the home of the sneak attack, the stab in the back, the
Oh, for God's sake!
Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick? I mean, it's not as if
I just took a shot at it.
Big night coming up?
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
There's no real proof that tobacco
Come again?
It wasn't a trick!
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you
There weren't any wires. I looked.
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
You're just jealous.
Of this... Superman.
Is that what they're calling him?
Super... man. Hmmm...
No thanks.
Yes, but I'm the only one who knows him. I I really like the guy. And he likes me. I think. I mean, I could talk to him, you know? And he could talk to me. Anytime...
What are you doing here?
Besides that.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
I'd better get you down.
Oh.
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Your father was a sick weirdo.
This??
So I've noticed.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
Even that would be an improvement.
He's from another world.
When it gets to seventy five below, stabilize it.
Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
I'm going to bed.
Tune me in, lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
No, you're going to get kissed,
You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?
What do you suggest, my dear?
Weak sister. I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle.
Nothing.
You have two minutes and thirty two seconds.
Something you can feed the pets, perhaps? Let's have it.
I knew you'd hit me.
Baby I'm going to take you higher.
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
I didn't bring any
What are you going to do to him?
You got wax in your ears?
He always shows up when somebody's in danger.
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
I mean the other one!
You can't do this to me!
Two.
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
Don't just stand there gapin'Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot... No one must ever know.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned. Poor thing.
I was thinkin'what to call him. I was thinkin'I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
We don't want a child called'Junior,'ain't that so, Clark? Why sure it is.
I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
Lara, please...
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems heat, cold, no life, no life support systems... No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong. He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
Well, physiologically, he... won't quite fit.
Then you have on of those'feelings.'It was called:'love. '
I guess I got carried away
No! You couldn't imagine
How good it felt
Or twenty four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for. Ah, this Earth... this world you live in, Kal El... Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do, Kal El, even now that you have... found yourself... is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us...
I was going to say that there's only one'p'in subpoena. What the hell did you major in at Radcliffe? Middle English? Nice job on the teamster's update, Kent.
Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.
Do as I say. Let go!
Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
Wha'... what are you doing here?
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
If I do, you can punish me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks. This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.
Oh. Well, where do we start?
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
Oh.
It must feel great.
How old are you?
How much do you weigh?
What about this X Ray vision of yours?
Can you really see through anything?
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Do you like pink?
Where do you hail from?
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I gave him steady employment
I gave him this new face.
Y'know? I'm sure of it. Y'know? And there's a strong streak of goody goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if I don't do something about it. Something!
Will kill him! And I'm going to have a piece of the rock! Miss Teschmacher, pack your
Cleaning a rock, Otis? Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
But... why?
Oh, that. Listen you're busy and it's a long story
No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you.
Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes
Couldn't have said it better myself. Now all this west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well...... call me a fool, but... it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to'do its thing.'Ah, it would've been so nice, y'know...
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it? Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
And garbage doors.
In a way oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot. There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it... target zero. Pancho's Taco Palace...
Ally. That's right.
I'm just fine, Ally. What about you?
And what does he do again?
We're... not together.
Yes... fine.
Not really. The last time I saw her was at that clinic. That was a long time ago.
Which one?
I don't remember the name. It was near a beach.
Then... when did she get better?
But you said...
She's in trouble?
What happened?
Alison.
Say hi to Zoe.
I hope she gets better.
I understand.
Leave us alone, Stephens. Leave the people of this town alone. You can't help.
Case?
I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer. And the Ottos wouldn't deal
I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel.
I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel...
They just finished supper.
It just seems... kind of weird.
I don't know.
No. I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but... I don't feel funny about that. I really liked her.
Oh. Right.
The children.
Say hello for me.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits. We're hardly unique here, Billy. I mean, I can understand how you feel.
Because it's what we have to do.
Okay, fine. So... stay out of it.
But yours is the one who's going to subpoena me, Sam. Force me to testify in court. He came by the garage this afternoon. Gave me this piece of paper.
That's wrong, Sam. You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years. This is never going to go away...
We've got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards. We've got people pointing fingers, making side deals, and dickering over percentages. Yesterday, I heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad. The rescue squad. Because they didn't act fast enough.
It's not enough. For hospital bills. For Nicole.
I'm sorry.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
That's because he misses you.
Your kids never cry.
They can look forward to that.
Just like we look forward to this.
... or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
I have to.
Because I have to.
Why did you do that, Billy?
About the Ottos?
No, nothing like that. The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions in a respectful way. They always help out at various fund raising bazaars in town, though they aren't church goers.
Oh yes. Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school. It's like he was their little treasure. He was such a beautiful boy. That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott.

From what?
No, nothing like that. Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago. He took over raising the children by himself. It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
No. I saw it on his face.
Yes. Like I was putting them into my big basket. Clearing the hillside of its children.
Yes. The old fashioned way.
With our hands.
What do you mean?
That's right.
What do you mean?
The Walkers loved Sean. He was their only child... the object of all their attention. I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man. That's his nature. But Risa, she's still got dreams.
Because I'd be to blame, right?
He knows that? Billy?
Billy said that?
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
Excuse me?
Anything you didn't understand?
I don't know. But it was weird in terms of what happened next. Sean was still watching his mother.
You hate it.
I could wrap it up. Protect the other kids.
Away from your crazy Mom.
We've only got honey.
What happened to summer?
And winter?
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here. He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
From you?
Who's Mr. Stephens?
No.
Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed.
It's like a song.
Nicole?
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
Because... he wanted to them to be punished.
Yes.
No. Not mean. Just... very angry.
Should I keep reading?
Yes. Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
I don't want you to lie.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole. Not in a situation like this.
I'm absolutely positive.
Why?
Hard to say. I might have... some business here.
When?
That's the local bar?
Indian?
Crafts.
Wanda does these photographic things. That's one of her pictures on the wall.
How old is she?
Is this it?
Here we go.
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window? How old was I, Daddy? Five or six? I got absolutely soaked, remember?
Why am I calling you? You're my father. I'm not supposed to call you? What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
Yes.
News?
Yes. Give me your news, Zoe.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
That's not news, Zoe.
I tested positive.
Welcome to hard times, Daddy.
What for?
Do you have the blood test?
Of... course I do. I just thought... I could get you another
I'm a lawyer.
Please, let me explain. I'll only take a moment of your time.
Please.
Yes.
You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto? That's why I'm here. To give your anger a voice. To be your
You think someone else caused the accident?
Isn't that what you want us to believe? That we're completely defenseless? That you know what's best?
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount. If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing. It's a standard agreement.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions. Drunk driving. Lost his licence. That's why he don't work no more.
How does the family survive?
What time in the morning was this?
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
Like what? I mean, I don't remember a lot.
My usual place. On the right side. The first seat.
Until the accident? No. Yes, there was.
Yes.
As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
You are?
Yes.
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
Why were you scared?
You could see the speedometer?
Seventy two miles an hour? You're sure of this?
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
Why not?
There wasn't time?
You remember this?
You're going to blow everyone away.
Of course.
I am. Really. It was awesome.
Does it fit?
Pretty slick, eh?
Do you like the colour?
And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
Well, yes. He's your lawyer too.
Partly. But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover. That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer. To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
Well, Mr. Stephens is representing several families. The Ottos, the Walkers, us, and I think a couple more. Mr. Stephens is suing the town for negligence. He's sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right. He's a very smart man.
Nothing good on your T. V.?
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse. I thought I'd take you over.
You seem... I don't know... well, distant, I guess. Hard to talk to.
Great.
Okay.
Will the police do anything to her?
She'll move away.
Someplace where no one knows her. Someplace strange and new.
Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night. Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
That's right! Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
That's the horse! Shotgun Shotgun in the fifth!
But of course...
A Senator, an Agent and Something With Long Red Hair.
Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there.
... excited with good reason, I wanted to say. Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet...
I guess you're right, but
I only had a few hours.
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
You told him that?
That's a nice tour. All booked? When was Susie around here last?
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
If it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours...
I see you're full of human feelings...
Right!
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear. You have my sincere word...
Serious as a deacon... I like it. I like your style, son! In a world of old rags and bones, I like it! For instance, take Sidney.
Is it news to you?
Just exactly what are you so hot about? I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but
Well, just be careful you don't knock her down, huh?
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
Wait a minute, I haven't handed over punishing privileges to you YET! Put the whip down and I might respect what you're saying...
I'm afraid I can't cope with them.
May I lift my eyebrows? What is this? What are you trying to do?
Son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt!
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately? Sidney, you were right the boy's a dilly.
Son, I don't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns. So suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day...
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Yes, he phoned. I don't know this boy too well. Anything in these charges?
Alan was not... unbalanced when I married him. And he was not...'indifferent to women'no matter what they said! HUNSECKER I'm not fighting with you, puss...
I said Sidney!...
Let me finish, dear. You had your say, now let me have mine...
Susie, I want to help you, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world.
Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here! Or will I be hearing next that I don't even have my sister's welfare at heart...
Why does everything you say sound like a threat?
Yeah. At Bellevue. Still hanging on. But they still don't know if she was pushed.
I remember ONCE when you didn't quite " put things together ". Boy! Was the Mayor mad!
You had something to do for me you didn't do it.
No. You're dead, son get yourself buried!
Yes, with your clients'names attached. That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you to see their names in my column all over the world! Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
The day that I can't get along without press agents'handouts, I'll close up shop, lock, stock and barrel and move to Alaska.
I'm a schoolboy teach me, teach me.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
No, lemme finish. I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB! That boy is dumb only on matinee days otherwise he's got a head. And Susan, like you said, she's growing up. Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
Correct me if I'm wrong WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
Tonight. Before you go to bed. The cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river.
How?
He means that much to you...?
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
Can't hurt? I had to get him back his job.
But it's too late. I got him back the job...
And who's feet is she on now?
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
What does that mean integrity?
Wild? Take a look at them and see who's wild...
Sidney, I know human nature. Susie lied to me she'll see that boy again.
Why give her real proof? You nearly ruined her with her first husband and you were right, J. J., but she almost followed him out the window. What do you want a chronic invalid?
Susie, there's nothing wrong with Dallas! Your brother and I arranged it all. And if the Leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life, forget it! your brother arranged that one, too! I don't usually give away presents; but this is my gift to you: Get out of here! Leave this man!
... And he's got them on him. I appreciate a thing like that I appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city.
Well, I'll be darned. And what does J. J. think he SHOULD do?
Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...
I don't think so.
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
You were thrilled to be interviewed. Were you " interviewed "?
And where was his wife?
We're old friends, Chickie quit it! A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball and chain and you make like a delicatessen counter! What did you think would happen in his house?
Yeah!
So take five minutes! Get acquainted! He's an important man he's lonely don't be dumb!
This sort of thing!
What would you think of me if
That's what I mean!
No, an arm, he said. I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
But...
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
Pay the rent. Let the tailor wait.
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
No. You think I'm a hero. I'm no hero. I'm nice to people where it pays me to be. I gotta do it too much on the outside, so don't expect me to kow tow in my own office. I'm in a bind right now with Hunsecker so Every dog has his day! Lock up and leave the key.
And leave a tip in every hat check room in town?
Don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
If you want me to
That's your idea of logic? I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man the Judge says, " Why not you? "
Dallas, ask your own manager he's standing here like a pained wolfhound Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife. So how do you get him doing J. J. a favor?
According to you, yeah. Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty! I don't like you, comma, but neither do I go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the Reds. Also, since we're talking repulsive, J. J. won't like this for two cents! Don't give me that look, Dallas J. J. believes in fair play. And secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication your her boyfriend!
Did you now? On which bounce?
Cheers. What time is it, Al?
See me in my office.
We stick in each others craw.
Well, for one thing, he thinks J. J. is some kind of monster.
Come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed...?
Yeah! Like me! I don't choke on my own gall I fight back! Let THEM choke, not me!
I know that bit you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for? Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
I didn't do anything!
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker. I can promise you
If you're funny, James, I'm a pretzel! Drop dead!
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and
I made you write a beautiful song...
Would you buy me a cup of coffee? In there...
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve for OUR sake, I mean.
I told your brother I couldn't be his accomplice. I can't be yours either, Susie, and encourage him to go on pulverizing you. I know what type he's my old man all over again!
You are saying goodbye, aren't you...?
I can't
Oh. I can't, honey. I'm on a roll here.
I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close.
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne... It's gotta be from the other one like you.
I was scary stuff, radically advanced. It was shattered... didn't work. But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of. All this work is based on it.
No shit?
It, John. Not him. It.
I don't trust it! These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know. We may never have this opportunity again.
Uh huh.
I know, Mom. I know.
I know!
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be. I can't do it. I'm screwing up the mission.
I see. So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
On Furtw  ngler.
Our duty is to help Furtw  ngler with his defence, That's why I want you to look at this... These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't get them translated fast enough. But I guess you understand German, right?
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
And no elbows on the table!
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
I'm very sorry.
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
I guess so, sir.
Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same.
So, what does the Russki want?
' Dim shits'?
So what is it?
What's that mean?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
That's big of him.
It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now? Did you hear the question?
You bet.
Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted.
My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtw  ngler?
I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert unequalled.
We're dealing with degenerates here.
But what... before that turns rotten... What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me. Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtw  ngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
Let Furtw  ngler go. Please.
Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
You do shorthand and typing?
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
Your mother, too.
And your father was executed.
Mine's the Eleventh.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
What's in those files?
You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven.
Of course.
I can't do this. It's not right.
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
I would like to go now, please.
Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man? I
How could I know what's in the archive?
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Yes, you remember.
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
Do it, Helmuth.
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
What?
Oh, I see, he made you co operate. And now are you a communist again?
Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here? This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning? I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts.
Furtw  ngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
One of your people told me.
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtw  ngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtw  ngler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front. But if you really want to get Furtw  ngler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand.
Politics and art must be kept separate. I'll remember that. But let me see if you can help me with something I just don't understand. I'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. What's his secret?
Was looking at Furtw  ngler like that?
When you got to the crescendo.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it. Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtw  ngler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtw  ngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
I don't know. I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Thanks, Chuck. I need the money. Can I still work the hours around my classes?
Can you handle it?
I'll do the same for you sometime.
Alright, the beige one.
Don't wear the beige one.
I'm here to help you. Reese, Sergeant / Tech Com, DN38416...
Pay attention. The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy. But these are new. They look human. Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot. I had to wait'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
No. Not yet. Not for about forty years.
And you're from the future too?
Defense network computer. New. Powerful. Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all. They say it got smart... a new order of intelli gence. Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. Decided out fate in a microsecond... extermination.
Hunter Killers. Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps... for orderly disposal.
Come here.
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
Forget it? Are you crazy? Let me see it.
Just talk. Tell me about my son. Is he tall?
Well, at least I know what to name him. I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
Stop! I don't want to know. Hold still. So... it was John that ordered you here?
You volunteered?
You'll learn.
John gave me a message for you. Made me memorize it.'Sarah "... this is the message...'Sarah, thank you. For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will. You must be stronger than you imagine you can be. You must survive, or I will never exist.'That's all.
About what?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Whatever... they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande... Skynet... for the government. Right?
Reese. Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again. We have to so it ourselves.
Listen. Understand. I'm not a military objective, Reese. I'm a person... You don't own me.
Hot dogs?
My whole life has been combat.
Not possible.
Don't say that.
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh? You must be pretty disappointed.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
A girl. You know.
And so you feel nothing.
Oh, Kyle.
The year 2027?
I see. And this... computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived? A sort of retroactive abortion?
Can't. Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Surrounded by living tissue.
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
Yes, but I don't want to leave. I think this guy's following me.
They've already been identi fied. There's no doubt.
Go ahead. You're safe. There're thirty cops in this building.
I hate the weird ones.
I put a cigarette out in it.
Send a unit.
Call her.
Call her again.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases. Where you going?
Admittedly...
But, the expectation was ten. And, in this case, expectation is everything.
My stock's falling. Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
It probably will. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time. Why should I settle for that?
You're talking tomorrow. Today is what counts.
What?
I'll be done in a minute. You misspoke before. You're not " stepping down. " I'm taking you out at the knees. The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore. I'm firing you. Action's taken. Confidence restored. Stock goes up. I sell my shares.
Remember Daniel Grant? Do they say, " without Daniel Grant, there is no Baer / Grant Publishing? " He's gone sailing, Alan. He's out there enjoying his golden years, probably wondering where you are.
We met, this morning. I signed the termination contract for Baer / Grace. I accepted your settlement, Nicholas. you were right. I'm going sailing.
Clean out your locker.
I'll be right with you.
Terrific. I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
I want to know what's going on. Are you part of this?
This can't be real...
Alright... okay...
Ten minutes ago, I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner. I get a note...
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks. Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
I'm sorry, about this...
Home.
How thoughtful. The gift of inconvenience.
Read what it says: " Warning, do not attempt to open. If elevator stops, use emergency... "
"... wait for help. " Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
It's much easier this way. Come on, step up...
Please...
Oh. FIne.
Consumer Recreation Services. It's their building. They...
Yes... well...
You're the one who started running.
That one did.
Nicholas Van Orton? What are you, a czar?
I don't spend much time looking out the window. I'll call you a taxi.
The maitre d'called you Christine.
Goodnight, Christy. It was nice meeting you.
Keep it.
They said five hundred. I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit. I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
It's okay, dad.
Where'd you get this?
I think I would remember. What makes you think it's me?
Okay.
I'm tired. I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
Yeah. First Communion. Aren't I a little angel?
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
Not here! They can see.
I could've handed you to them. They find me now, I'm dead...
You don't have a choice. No one else is going to tell you what's going on.
Then, what good are you?
That's a lie...
They did the same to him as they did to you.
They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough.
All I mean is... someone like you...
What?
I don't know. A lot.
It's out of your hands.
Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
Get us out!
How deluded can you be? There's no why...
It wasn't you. It wasn't personal...
That gun. That... that's not automatic. The guard had an automatic...
It's mine...
Guess you missed it.
Nicholas, this is fake. It's all part of the game...
No, now wait... think about it. What did you see...?
What did you really see? This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies. Please, you've got to believe me... He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Okay... okay... I put it down. Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door. He's an actor...
Nicholas...
Let me show you...
It is. It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money. Nobody stole anything. They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
Open that door, you'll see. Your brother's there... Conrad. He's there. It's your birthday party...
Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
No!
I didn't know what else to call you.
Claire. Pleased to meet you.
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia. I'm just a walk on this time though. Bit part.
Is this something you're interested in? I'm not really that person I was.
Like what... my favorite color...?
Originally, Connecticut.
One brother, one sister.
Julliard, yeah.
Yes.
No.
Always.
Happy Birthday, man.
That's why it's a classic. Come on, man... how'bout a hug...?
Not after I'm done with it. Actually, I've been here. In grad school I bought crystal meth from the maitre d'.
About me?
Never better.
Divorced. Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
I redecorated. What about you?
Connie... what brings you here? Is everything alright?
You need anything?
Really?
Trust me. Call that number.
They make your life fun. Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
You've heard of it. You've seen other people having it. They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
It's a profound life experience.
Call them. Trust me.
Will you?
But, will you?
Why would you say that?
It doesn't matter...
Do it for YOU.
I know...
What's this all about, Connie?
Who?
Yeah, almost...
How do you mean, exactly?
Slow down, take a breath...
What have they been doing to you?
Calm down. Why would they keep playing after you paid?
How do you know?
Okay... okay.
Do you know how to change a tire?
What? Connie...
You're behind this, aren't you? You and your sick friends. Well, make it stop!
Because you hate me. Because you had to be here, when mom died. Because you had to do it alone. Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too. I'd have been here...
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry! How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me...?
Split it?
Where's Christine? The waitress.
Did she?
It always is.
Yes.
I don't speak Spanish. All I need is to get back... just enough for that.
And, they didn't take that watch?
I know, look at me, well... What happened? I don't know. I don't even really know. I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends. If I could have you back in my life... in some small way. It would be important.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
I know.
Oh, here we go...
You need to fill out those forms. Application, psych tests: M. M. P. I. and T. A. T. For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like. We'll run a T. R. W....
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn ons, turn offs...
Oh... it's a game.
Tailored specifically to each participant. Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
It's different every time.
We provide whatever's lacking.
May I make two suggestions...?
First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing. Second, you don't have to decide today. Take the silly tests, fill out the forms. One day, the game begins. You either love it or hate it. Decide then. We're like an experimental Book of the Month Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation. That was my sales pitch.
Physical?
It's all down to this...
It's never happened. We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
That's right you're a left brain word fetishist.
Nobody knows, pal. Nobody gets the big picture... Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
They own the whole building. They just move from floor to floor.
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
I don't want money. I'm pulling back the curtain. I'm here to meet the wizard.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
Guess!
Don't be nervous. They said you'd be nervous.
Well... send my love, if you see him again.
I've finished for the evening. Will you be needing anything else?
Goodnight then.
Yes. What do you mean? What's wrong?
I don't know what you're talking about. What's happened?
No. What happened... no one expected it.
Not much, I think.
You're not like him at all. I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Nobody worried about your father.
What's this about?
Where's my brother?
He couldn't, or refused to pay. We extended credit...
There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said. The police took him. They left this address, in case anyone...
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
The Hinchberger wedding.
I'll send your regrets. Honestly, why must I even bother?
What?
What gentleman, Maria?
Cancel lunch. Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts.
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just driving...
Friend... why don't you back off.
Greetings fellow sheep counter.
Every year is a good year.
And what kind of sleeper?
Obsessive worrier. Join the club. And you? I'd guess...
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
I've read your tests.
You get your money.
She got the child labor stuff from me.
So could you! Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
That depends on your definition of ghosts. I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
Yeah.
Maybe someday.
No, Malcolm! Individual performance is only part of it. I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
But if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results. The deception is minor.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
I, I just can't...
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Nell. Good enough. And I'm Jim.
Well... we're glad to have you.
How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing? Water hammer, something like that?
All right...
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories. And a memory can trigger a smell.
What happened after you smelled it?
Like she smelled it too?
And then what happened?
No you're not. Something moved you. You saw something.
It was a stupid thing to do.
Welcome Home.
Sure.
I don't know.
Then who called me?
You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?
Because it's my phone. Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you. See you soon. Thank you.
This is where we're going?
But the experiment was a failure.
What did it cost?
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
Wait. You're not wearing that ironically? This is really you?
What do you do?
That depends.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
No.
I don't have anyone. But I do have a little apartment of my own. It has a little flower garden. You can just see the ocean. At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
No. The world has missed you.
David.
Why?
Before he painted your name over Mister Crain.
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
Red. What else?
Okay.
But the painting!
I do.
Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
Gordon? He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
Not for you, clearly.
Am I a thing?
I'm not.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's not a compliment.
As soon as you get dressed.
Anything but Japanese.
I'm not into finger foods. Too fussy.
I don't like do it yourself cuisine. Buffets. Salad bars.
It's just fuel to me. I'm not there for distractions.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Italian.
Not who, food. Should we get Italian.
It must've been a time. A golden moment.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
I sure hope so.
We can't find...... two of our guys.
Because
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
When you find the guy, you'll know.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end zone. He's a hit and run gunman I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
See, a successful man like me has limitations I lose touch at a street level. So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
That's why I'm letting you take care of this. I'm the one with appearances to maintain. But who gives a shit about you? Not even God.
What kind?
Our black friends?
I thought he was in prison, in England.
What did you tell them.
As it happens. I didn't make that part up.
I don't know everyone here. He was so traumatized he split. Maybe he was Gordon's pusher.
No. I mean. Not even your people should be involved. Right? It's too close now.
You think I'm staying?
Well, can we make it one more. Nowhere the fuck near me.
Fuck you.
Huh?
You came to the right place, sir. My wife's second cousin is English. Well, Scotch Irish. Can I interest you in a holster?
You're in gun country now, my friend.
Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features makes a nice concealed carry piece.
No problem. If you don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen.
That's a high end item. Total reliability.
Yes, sir. Won't find a better CQC on the market.
You're home, then.
I mean, what has it been six months?
Snuffed her.
Valentine. What's he got to say for himself?
I dunno... Maybe they do.
I knew when I was droppin'that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face. I did my time, okay? My sister, her ol'man's up in Chino right now doin'eight years.
You kiddin', man? I don't need a wife and screamin'kids. I still got my youth.
Where abouts?
Valentine wasn't even there. If he was into something, if she was involved who can say. But I'll tell you something. She stood in front of these dudes, man. Eyeballing them. Checking them out. I felt like she was covering my ass that day.
Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball. Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin'a little too fast... Those curves don't kid around.
She didn't know what to say. I thought someone should say something. To someone. With me it was, I don't know Jenny liked me for some reason. I felt like I owed her.
Not me, man. I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I already told you, man. Corcoran. Know what that is? State prison.
But that's not me anymore. That's when I was into the gang lifestyle. That's not who I am now. Five years in the joint that's it for me, man.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Probation? Man, you crazy. They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
I mean, it's already a steal, n'it what you said four hundred for this one?
Five years, I think. Long time.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work. That's not where they met.
No, no Jenny used to work as a waitress. Before she met him. But that's not where she met me. Not in my restaurant.
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Huh?
What?
Has he?
Well, that's what we're doin', n'it.
First in, first out, that's me.
One thing I need.
Too easy?
You think a fuckin'guy like that ever will? What more do you want, man?
Do you have any friends, man?
The lot. The whole British bloody Post Office. I had a brilliant plan all worked out work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested? No they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman. Lazy sods. Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
Same.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity waiver thing?
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know with Pacino and DeNiro. Got three callbacks.
Didn't get it.
Not no more, they ain't. I quit that acting shit, man.
Hell, no. I started writing.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
She used to pinch'em off me. Funny that. One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
No, why did you come here?
How d'you mean?
I was skint didn't have no money to get here.
What was that, then?
It was the bars, then.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out. From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it? Pink Floyd concert receipts. Jenny would've been... fourteen at the time?
Well, that kind of security can't be bought. Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
Here, are you always this sarky?
Weren't you on a television series?
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Oh, it just ended, then.
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
Ashamed.
She never told anyone else. About the convict strain or is it stain? No, I was privileged. I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double duty as a voice coach. Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress. Not with that look.
Modelling.
She was twenty one when she came to me.... Straight from leaving you.
She was happy here. However the two of you might have parted. Don't think she wasn't.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
I might've been away for the weekend.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
I gave him yours. Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative. I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny. Who told me she didn't have a father before proceeding of course to tell me why.
Were you still married at the time to Jenny's mother, I mean?
What's that, like a P. O. box.
Where you get your bank statements.
Eight hours difference between here and London. Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time. I was just coming out on the yard. Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then. Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do. And I'll tell ya: I couldn't open the paper. Could not pry the pages apart it was like they was glued together. That's how weak my hands went. Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't. Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white. I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on,'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew... Something had happened to Jen.
Your employer?
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
What line is he in.
I see.
I bet.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
Right.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him.
Are you serious.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction. Not the type.
On what. What makes you so certain.
There's the phone. You want his number.
She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more... pissed off angry than upset or afraid. But she never turned up. I called the house but only got the answer machine. When they found her... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me. Or coming straight to see me. Who knows. Maybe she just wanted to drive.
And how did you get it?
These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
Tell us about it.
Oh, I was gonna say...
I can see the attraction.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
It didn't discourage you, though.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
I was inside once. I punched a cop at a demo.
Who remembers.
Overnight. What about just now?
You have been away. Or is all this just new to you?
I don't believe it.
Pushing the legal limit even then.
Only in the movies.
Yeah, well, you're here now where h urricanes h ardly ever h appen.
Stick with me, kid. Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
Nah she was married to me grandad he was as bent as a boomerang used to make knuckle dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill. Watching Doris Day.
Black market during the war.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
I fiddle it. They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
I know that. But as time went on... well, it wasn't a joke, was it? She had a feeling about it about the last job how long I'd get the hook for. Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.
How far?
Fancy it?
Never thought of that. Busman's holiday.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
Bloke told me.
Poor baby.
Well, I'll tell you. I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
But I can't be sure. I don't even know who he is. He's too insulated. Too many layers around him.
Yeah, I guess you are.
That dude who works for Valentine. He's the one sent those guys after you. You know that.
So what's your beef, pal?
It was you. Downtown.
Because that wasn't anything to do with me. And suspicion has been cast in my direction. Didn't make any sense. Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut. Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
Of the deal, man.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you... that must make us pals.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
What am I doing?
A statement? I wouldn't mind getting a statement. You see, my client the United States Government would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown? There's some folks there oh, wait, they're all dead. Any of this ring a bell?
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
Where is he now?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
You sure?
That's too bad. Ian's got a good thing going over there.
Turned that place completely around. 180 degrees.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Yeah. I really admire the guy. Well. Good to meet you.
No rest for the wicked.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know. I shouldn't have even been there it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place. I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for. I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
I had to, didn't I. Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years my contract wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Could do, yeah.
Yeah.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car. Who's driving?
Exercising my visitation rights.
I miss my kids.
Sure you do.
Is he here?
Go to him. Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp
In a couple of days this whole thing
Go now.
EMI in London. I work with Ian.
You must know Ian.
Great bloke. Really turned things around there. 180 degrees.
Oh, I think a shake up was in order. Definitely. Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they? Forgetful. Start thinking they can get away with things. Gotta shake'em up now and again, make'em pay attention.
Tell you...
Of course, you know, Doris had nothing to do with it. Nothing at all.
And you should tell Doris...
Ann
Ann
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
Yeah. Thanks.
Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry.
Birdy, I've been doing a lot of thinking. There are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. Life has dealt me some bum cards...
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
Just see him, as a favor to me.
But more or less.
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
You're an enthusiast.
It's OK...
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so and so tells me his situation has changed all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother,'dry cleaning'wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
That's right! Dry cleaning remember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is  10, 000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on...
I'm, uh, I'm the barber.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
Sure.
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
Fifty fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So you've got the dough then, do ya?
Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well...
You're out of line, mister.
Right! Strictly business.
Cash?!
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer
Yeah, screw'em, huh? Pay'em to tangle it up and then you pay'em to untangle it, what's the point?
Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
All right.
OK.
She's a rare one.
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery casual wear, pyjamas, ladies'foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
... Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit'course, you're in the smock all day.
Uh huh.
Uh huh.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Uh huh.
How much to they want, Dave?
... You know... who  who  is?
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that
That's my capitalization on the Annex!  My  operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn wife!
Please, Ed.
OK.
What kind of man  are  you?
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
I'm not proud of what I did. But  you .
Mm.
Yeah, right.
Oh, don't be a grump.
Dave.
Ahh...
 That means I don't run Nirdlinger's! 
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, I'm sure.
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
I knew we'd pay for it.
No thanks.
I'm fine.
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
Taking it seriously.
No thanks, honey.
Well, the best, the money is no object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento.'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
Yeah, the best.
Birdy's in the parlor I'm on long distance here.
I don't work here. My wife does.
Yeah.
Uh huh.
How d'ya like them apples?
Russians exploded an A bomb.
Jesus...
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...
This hair.
... You ever wonder about it?
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
You don't got a headache?
Damn, I got a headache to beat the band.
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
The hell with it, Eddie!
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A  rock , the barbershop. I mean, how long has  this  place been here?
My  wife ?
Birdy...
You also have an interest in the securing property?
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
Yeah?
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
Sure. Can Ed come too?
Second chair.
No, he's family, he's my brother in law.
Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... He's the decedent.
Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.
His eyes are open.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
Under arrest for murder.
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder. Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story. You want to see them?
I'll go down and speak to him.
Pendergast may be in trouble. Don't you understand? He still hasn't come back. It's been over three hours
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk in safe and a portable phone! We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
Behind you.
I'll do it. Just let me find my portable phone.
Just a minute. I'm shaking! Take the gun.
Oh Jesus...
It's fool proof, basically. I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip. If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
In every exhibition room. The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five. We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
You don't know much about computers, Lieutenant. There are safeguards built in. We have back up systems with redundancies. There's no way these computers can fail.
I told you! They seal off all the cells. They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure
I made it outside. I'll co ordinate the rescue efforts from here. Help is on the way. Just sit tight.
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
Dr. Green has to see you!
It's important. Please. You have to come! Pendergast, too. She's found out something.
What's that doing here?
Now Margo, don't overreact. Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow. My leaving makes perfect sense. This isn't exactly early retirement. I've overstayed the party a bit.
That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news. Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants? Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm.
No, Margo. This is one problem you can't solve. You have to stay out of it. The fact is, I want to retire.
Yes it is. I'm tired and I'm no longer needed
With all due respect, dear, that's bull. You dance rings around me with your new technology. You've left me in the dust.
Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.
You must.
Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty odd years. That's quite enough.
Let me see the plant press.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui. John used it as packing material.
They're eggs.
Come on, Margo. We're on the verge of something huge. Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room. What if John was right. I mean, what if? And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates. When it got to the museum, it hatched.
But a virus normally codes for other viruses. This one's making human and animal proteins. Listen to this. " Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone. 4 monoxytocin supressin hormone. "
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
And it's hungry. It's been two days since it's eaten. There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell! All those people in one enclosed space...
I think so.
That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.
Remember, it has poor eyesight. It hunts with its sense of smell. So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!
What do you do?
Nothing. I'm in third grade. What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma'callit?
Way cool. Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
Let's ditch and find them ourselves.
I don't know. But I think it's bad.
Not that big.
They were yellow!
What?
There's another possibility. A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Yes. Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant. When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach. The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
Not today. Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
Where exactly?
Where in Fiji? What island?
Viti Levu. For how many?
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
I'm sorry. I don't have anything for at least a month.
It's the busy season.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow. But you wouldn't want to do that.
I thought you were in a hurry.
You want to book the flight?
Why wasn't I told? Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported. Is that the best shot we can get?
What's on the ClockCam?
He has to be on foot. He has the world's most recognizable face. He can't disappear.
It's just a matter of time.
Sweep the harbor.
Storm music... Wagner...
A show. Then who am I?
You never had a camera in my head.
The memory of who?
I can't believe he married Meryl on the rebound.
Why not?
Sure she would.
Lauren, right?
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank
You have a boyfriend? Of course you do.
No.
Right now? We've got finals tomorrow.
Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island... out!
It's not that simple. Takes money, planning. You can't just up and go. Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that. I've just got to move slow. Pick my moment. Bonus time's just around the corner. Soon as I finish the...
Spare room I can start thinking about selling up... and I'll be gone. Up and away on that big steel bird. I'm going, don't you worry about that.
I figured, what's the point? I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me. Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes. I realized, what the hell could be better than this? I'm telling you. What you really need is someone to carry on the " Burbank " name.
Trust me.
I can't tonight.
I'm onto something, Marlon something big.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
I think he's alive. I'll tell you about it later. I'm definitely being followed.
It's hard to tell. They look just like regular people.
Could be. Beard looks phony. It's when I'm unpredictable. They can't stand that. That's why we've got to get out of here. Can you come with me?
I've got to show you something.
What exactly?
No.
I went all over but I never found a place like this. Look at that sunset, Truman. It's perfect.
That's the " Big Guy ". Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Really?
This is different. Everybody seems to be in on it.
Not the whole thing, Truman. You were right about one thing.
The thing that started all of this.
Did something happen today?
Oh, God.
Every time you and Marlon
And then what, Truman? We'd be back to where we were five years ago. You're talking like a teenager.
We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments. Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?
That can wait. I want to get away. See some of the world. Explore.
I know.
Your mother called. You shouldn't upset her like that.
I'm not hungry.
See you in a minute, sweetheart.
What's the hurry?
What do I do?
You're a nurse, aren't you?
We need more charcoal.
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji. Is that it?
That's right. I do, don't I?
Because I never have. That's why you go places, isn't it?
Should I?
Let me out, Truman. You're not right in the head. You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
Uhuh. There's no accident. It's just more stalling.
So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea? I'd better call your mother when we get there. She'll be worried sick I don't know how she's going to take this.
That's not true.
I've tasted other cocoas. This is the best.
You're part of this, aren't you?!
No. You said, " Do something. " Who were you talking to? Tell me!
How's your hip?
I feel certain my condition runs in the family. Can't this wait, dear?
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown. We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
Darling
You know he was an only child, like you. I know how bad you feel about what happened sailing into that storm. But I don't blame you, Truman. I never have.
It looks so small.
Sure. Okay. Fine. Can you pass on a message?
Tell her, tell her... I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
You got it.
Is there any way around?
Well, thank you for your help.
They're going to stop me talking to you.
Just listen. You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan
And your teacher said, " You're too late, Truman. There's nothing left to explore. "
It doesn't matter. Everybody knows about it. They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
You must listen. Everybody's pretending, Truman.
Good. Good.
I'd ask for identification.
Well, we're FBI agents.
A woman? Work.
Why don't you go home to the old lady
Penetration but not perforation.
They took her
Evidence of what?
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove
Those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully
Agent Mulder.
No, they don't.
I'm looking for him.
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
Old friend of your father's.
You a reporter?
Who sent you?
Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab...
He just let it explode.
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
That's what I'm saying.
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
You know my work?
I don't either, but it sure sells books.
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non elected government. Think about that. What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
What killed those men?
I'll know soon enough.
A plague?
Negotiating with whom?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
What?
You saw this experiment?
That would be my guess.
You've been using me
You didn't know my father
You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you?
And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
I'm on the roof.
No. I haven't.
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data if you ignore it as we have done the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
Oh yeah. Had you big time.
I just did. You're buying.
Where are you, Mulder?
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
What? What are you talking about?
Why?
They were the ones that put us together.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
You're... quitting?
Why not? It's three AM.
Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
Is that what you'd like me to do?
Mulder what are you doing?
And you're looking for?
I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
You're saying the bombing was a cover up. Of what?
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here. I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
What did you find?
What kind of infection?
Scully listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
What did you find?
How was it contracted?
I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
And you've never seen anything like that?
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
And where are they going with it?
Where would they be going?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
Yeah, well they may this one.
This virus it...
It may be extraterrestrial.
Been where?
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Maybe. Maybe not.
Run.
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew
You're on the verge, Mulder please don't do this to me
I have. I did. It's done.
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers
You don't Mulder you've never needed me. I've only held you back. I've got to go.
No it's
You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.
They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
Agent Mulder we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred
If it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back.
I know. Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S. A. C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
I don't know.
Four and twenty blackbirds.
" Mocky Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky Lock wants me where I am. "
Someday you can. We all believe that...
I don't want to find out.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
I do it all the time!
I'd be there for him.
Okay, okay...
Good. We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time. Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
That's my girl.
Nothing.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
She said convincingly.
Baked in a pie.
Agent Novak. I didn't get a chance to clear him.
I know.
... give a kiss to Edward.
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure. They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why. Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully. It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean. But these last three... They were still in water always in water but Listen, he wasn't just careless. It went beyond that...
How hard could it be...?
I know him.
No. Not at all. From what I understand, he knows I " m here, isn't that right?
What then?
Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
That's what therapists are for, right?
A kingdom. His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear. A horrible primitive ugly thing. I don't want to talk in here.
As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes. He makes Julia real for me.
You were right. There's a part of him that knows the truth. About what he did, about himself.
You think you can do this, don't you?
This is Stargher we're talking about?
Whoa. Hold on. Aren't they the same guy?
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like " remorse. "
Evil.
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
Tell me.
Yes. I am.
He brought you to me, didn't he? If you want Julia to live, trust me. Trust him.
Good for them.
So you say.
I don't know. I think it does. You know, Catherine... If you ever want to talk about it. What happened to Stargher. That last time.
No. Thank you.
Oh no... No you don't.
I bet we can fix it.
Already there.
Yep. And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
I never kid. My wife hates it. Says I'm too serious.
It would take hours to re route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.
Any psychiatric medication?
What about narcotics?
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
I doubt that.
You're looking well.
That's a secret.
What about the cat?
Now.
No. Can you get a man close?
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts. Do you really understand what they're going to do?
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch. Carl Stargher. That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer. A case that makes careers. But if we push our luck. If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die.
But you looked so cute. All sleepy...
You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary. I don't care.
Sayen sie ed our den Leuten damit sie es auch wissen.
Das worren nooh zeiten.
Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
No, no... oh... excuse me.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
Oh, yes, yes.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
His own doctor?
Were you at the inquest?
Mmmm.
Why don't you leave this town go home?
Why?
Silly looking bunch.
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
" Ein hurigan " I guess.
Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry... we didn't do...
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
Holly.
It's all right.
Let's not get into any more trouble.
I wish I knew.
Have you seen Calloway?
Have you?
He liked to laugh.
I'll put these flowers in water.
You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
How do you know?
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
Oh, well.
We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins...
Keep the packet.
That's the reason.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
He works in a military hospital.
It's stupid to lie to me, Miss Schmidt. I'm in a position to help you.
That's what we want to find out.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
They are private letters.
Well, I've got it when you want it, miss.
Good bye.
Where?
How will I know you?
Thank you.
You a friend of Lime's?
Been here long?
Schmolka!
September'39.
No, sorry.
" Death at the Double X Ranch " Ra a nch.
Him dying like that.
He was...
Pin it on a...
Oh, pinning things on girls now.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
I'm only a little fool I'm an amateur at it you're a professional. You've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
I can't. He disappeared...
This is where he vanished.
I suppose you don't believe me.
Look... I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Fifty yards right down there.
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
Calloway, you expect too much. I know he deserves to hang, you proved your stuff. But twenty years is a long time don't ask me to tie the rope.
Why don't you come in, too you're a writer... Might interest you.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Win what?
One can't just leave please.
Do you know his number?
Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.
Heard of Harry Lime?
Is that what you say to people after death? " Goodness that's awkward... "
On the modern novel you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Listen...
I want to talk to you.
Tough... tough... Don't worry, old man, they won't hurt her.
Holly...
Did the police believe you?
Do you expect me to give myself up?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
Outside of your stories... I've got to be careful.
I wish I could get rid of this thing.
What did you expect me to be part of your...
Sure...
Zwei zwartze.
Will you give me...
Yes. The man who helped carry him.
Vinkel... You've got quite a collection of er collection.
Thank you.
I can tell you very little. He was run over by a car. He was dead when I arrived.
Not necessarily.
You remember me? Upstairs...
What does he say?
Not saw, heard... heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er... er Joseph... that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Oh, er oh... was he was he still alive?
I was told that he did not die at once.
The Roumanian?
And?
No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Suppose I take...
Das hat man davon wenn man freundlich ist mit den auslandern...
Something wrong.
Will we never teach these Austrians to be good citizens. It was his duty to give the evidence.
Joseph Harbin? No... no.
Where are you staying?
His name?
I thought he'd be here to meet me.
I'm Daffy.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Just five dollars, please.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
There is one problem.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
We're going to swim " one or two kilometers " across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
We think in miles, not kilometers.
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
I think we're about half way.
A fin!
Big?
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
A bit fucking late.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
But he has been there, off course.
Richard?
I hope our noise did not keep you awake.
Swim?
I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
Exactly.
It's just the sky, Richard.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
They had Sabra and Shattila.
The Nazis did everything the f  hrer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality.
She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front....
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.
Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... Give me the paint. Give it to me.
Why'd we have to leave so fast?
Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... He's a putz.
Let's look at the fucking thing.
The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings.
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
Just don't.
This? This is a joke. I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones. Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
You will.
Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?
Too difficult?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
Where'd you read all that stuff?
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
Are they still together?
Is he a Nazi?
What's he care about?
Bigger and better.
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
' Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...
Va yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo mimohlad tcha oo m'bayt avaycha el ha ertez asher arecha...
And God said to Avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land a different land and I will show you....
Know your enemy....'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
I'm good at languages.
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
Yeah, it's stupid. Put it on, or I won't teach you.
You can't curse in front of it either.
It looks a little like a swastika.
Where are they?
The sex is better.
With you there's a tragic dimension.
V'asitem lechem pessel to monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
What's it about?
And belief follows?
Fuck that.
Why should I submit?
You think I should just because there's no reason?
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
You want a punch in the mouth?
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
I don't know. I just want to try it.
No. What are you looking for?
He commands it whether He exists or not... Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Yeah, okay. But what if... what if... submitting... being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have?
You don't own this place.
Nothing. Let's go....
Decentralized, nonviolent, increasingly mainstream. We'll see antiabortion, anti immigration groups form alliances with the gun lobby, Christian identity types, tax resisters and even some libertarians....
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
I'd have to research it, study his routines, his security.... But ideally on a New York street at midday, using a small caliber automatic without a silencer.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
They left an hour ago. You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on. How soon can you get back to the city?
What's that? Okay. Surprise us...
I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next.... I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
Curtis is a politician and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
Danny, what about the Jews?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
And? WHat did you notice?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Real men white, Christian men we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust he can't assert himself that directly so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you? After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
The Jews clearly control the media and the banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society.
Those aren't Jews.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he " universalizes " everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength.... Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife... can't escape. They're still just Jews.
Who? How would I know him?
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
Look at me. DO I look Jewish? Look...
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Why would Nadelman lie?
Give me a reason not to.
Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no.
How do you reconcile the two?
Explain it so I can.
I don't think you know what you are.
Who killed Manzetti?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would. Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
I thought you hated Torah.
Point out all the lies and fucked up thinking.
This is me.
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
Which Times guy?
It was a nine millimeter.
So are you... But they'll believe you.... Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house. Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
Think about your father. Your sister.
Danny, I'm trying to save you.
Balint?
What part of Germany are you people from?
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
Ilio Manzetti... former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.
Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish. Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.
We want to talk to you about something.... We're about to launch an aboveground, intellectually serious fascist movement.
What is happening?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
Tell it to Hitler.
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
Do you know them? I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and
You can heat them up and eat with him.
New York Times...?
Isn't it true?
Can anybody imagine why I would say a Jewish prayer?
Get out of here....
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand new power cell. Plus we'll have a back up timer.
It will.
Christ...
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Mrs. Moebius.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
I have an idea....
It's not going to be fine. It's
So that's what? Nineteen thirty minutes... what time is it now...
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
Are you an artist?
You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
How?
Just get him in the cross hairs. With those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up.
What's that?
Exactly.
Leary?
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
' Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
Just a little... What's the difference?
... May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
And let us say...
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
Does he know?
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
Of course.
... You take care of yourself, Johana.
Johana, am I boring you?
I said that the file is incomplete.
My God! I'm glad I didn't go.
The mafia! La Cosa Nostra!
No!
It can't be true!
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Yes. Of course. Very wise.
You're right. You're fired.
The Italian, I presume?
He seems to have won it.
You know each other?
Enzo Molinari.
I might have known. As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world. One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
I'll take you there. We'll live in the sun. You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees.
You'll be lovely, but no thanks. Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
Forever. We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
Little. Very little. And skinny, very skinny too. That is compared to me.
Exactly! What is it Johana? You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?!
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin'gold fish, and says: " I'm going to beat you ".
Listen to her! " That's what he's here for "! He's here to loose, that's what he's here for. First of all, I'm unbeatable. Second, how old are you?
Don't you agree, Jacques?
Yes...
The Mamma's there too.
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
Checking out the competition.
What else is there?
Because you'd laugh.
I dive in search of God. If I go deep enough I'm going to find him.
He can learn. He is learning.
How do you know that?
Why?
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Enzo, really. What are you going to get?
It isn't lit yet.
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying " it " on board?!
... What's your name again?
And where did you say you were from?
And... does the voice come back?
Try speaking to me?
If you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?
I dove 315 feet!
They say I'm like Lazarus. You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
You're the best, Enzo!
I don't have one.
It's okay, Enzo. I'll go somewhere else.
Enzo drop it, I'll find something.
It's okay.
Damn right! That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Forget it. I was joking.
You're staying at the hotel?
Your mother?
Get in the car!
Why? Are they what's most important?
... Everything.
Well... about everything.
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
What?
Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it! Look here!
You don't have that one, do you?
Oh it's nothing. I knew it. I told Roberto " He's very good that little Frenchman, very good ". I lost my title but I won a watch!
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
I give you this. You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
It's never the sea! It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit! Jacques, what do you know?
No! I would never cheat you.
... It is much better down there. It's a better place.
Jacques, take me back down... Please.
Does anybody live to make a second?
Tea... or whiskey?
The guy in the Halloween suit!
In the lake?
I'm being a pain in the ass. It's beautiful here.
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it. It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
... Especially the sneakers.
You jumped in?
My wallet.
Give it to me.
I'd better get back now.
I don't know, I just feel it.
Aren't you happy? Don't you feel proud...? I feel proud and all I did was watch.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
Yes you do. You know exactly what I'm talking about. You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Then, tell me a story.
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there... and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out. They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere. If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
You sure?
Okay. In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
You'll try again tomorrow?
You want to lie down for a while?
Why?
You are the father.
Promise you won't forget me.
They got the new T. V.
Yep. How was your trip...? Help me clean up, okay?
They're going to send detectives.
How was your trip?
Okay... Who'd you meet?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
You look it too. You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins! You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
What is it honey... the frenchy?
Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
That's the experiment? Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
In the spring when he melts!
He isn't going to breathe.
It depends. He should come up soon. Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
You've made me a happy insurance person.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
I'm gonna pay a visit to the K. L. F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.
That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole.
No way, it's too dangerous. Besides, my days of hooking are over.
My Esther! Oh Mordechai.
I know sir. I won't let you down.
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good friend, but my days...
Oh!
You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke... Oh. I get it.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
I'll be in my office.
Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother.
Take a look.
Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
Thanks. Oh, did I tell you. I picked up that new KC and the Sunshine Band record that you recommended. You were right, it is good.
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
Take a look.
Why not if you like it  if that's what you really want.
Mmm    yes.
You get your money from your husband.
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
And when you drink, you get drunk.
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
And my leopard maybe he hurt the first girl but no more.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
They don't say it to me.
Sure.
No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!
I want him to lock me up.
I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
 They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
All men are fools. They like to make a big show  shout and hunt
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
The elderly man I told you about.
At four. He will be there at four.
What, senorita?
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed  He'll come up with something.
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches  
Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats'nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
I'll miss you too, honey
You know all about these things and I've lived here all my life  and I still don't know what the Procession means.
Oh, that's so interesting!
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town be everywhere at once be sure nothing happens to anybody.
You know about animals their habits will it come back?
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
It doesn't jibe with this   you told me the leopard would go out into the country  it wouldn't stay in the city  
That's what I don't understand why should it come here and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
Why?
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
I'll take you about. Got some nice things.
Yes.
Some crazy guy.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
You, Charlie you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage  eh?
Some other time.
All right the dead, then. In history there must have been men like that men with kinks in their brains
To the eye? Like other men.
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
It was you.
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight
Consuelo screamed too and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
Tell me.
Then you found the leopard
That was unfortunate.
Thanks.
They do, but there are no lights out there  they'll just be shadows 
It's not for me. I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it what risks they make other people run what agony and sorrow they bring to other people
No. He was kidding Charlie.
Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man.
I'm sure of it!
Makes no difference. Get him out!
That's easy. Me.
On his back, I suppose.
You're too good to me.
No  not yet.
Get it out of here!
Makes no difference. Get him out.
That's easy. Me.
On his back, I suppose.
You're too good to me.
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
No   not yet.
Clo Clo?
What did he have to do  look at the body?
And did you find the leopard?
Our first real break and we throw wild animals at the audience
Yes.
Yes. Do you mind?
That doesn't make sense.
Absolutely sure.
I got into a little crap game.
I I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways 
How do you know?
I hated you that day  you and your flip talk  with that little girl lying dead.
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft inside  where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Ha ha... Yeah... What about that road back there, though? It says  closed to the public , doesn  t it?
That might depend on where you  re going.
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
I  m afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...
You wouldn  t recall if the brothers in law left together, would you?
No. Thank you. I  ll be fine...
That depends what you  re looking at.
Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldn  t want anyone to interfere with his  Art ! Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes? The  1, 000. You gave it to him in cash?
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
Oh oh! Touch , Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh? No. Don  t. You might get confused speaking of things you don  t understand and we need you clear headed, at least until you  ve done what we are paying you for.
Can it be that easy?
Anything is possible.
It  s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I  m told it retails at around  4, 000. I see you don  t require a definition.
There  s more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for  15, 000.
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise. You don  t mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is he  s either on the run, held captive, or dead. I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I  ve seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I  m here at such a late hour. I need  20, 000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
I can  t tell you that yet. But he  s being well looked after.
Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let down it might be, your brother  s not back to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than he  d bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table... Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told you I had bad news...
No. The question now is how long it  s going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Get out of my house. You  re fired, Mr Lombard.
No. You  re fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
Who is Friedman?
I  m impressed. That information could have cost me  20, 000.
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Just a moment... Go ahead.
... 7548. Have you... Have you found him yet?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. I  ll give it 24 hours. He just might show up. If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.
When did you get back?
I... Well, we  re burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but it  s late and with the funeral...
I... If you don  t mind, I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. There  s no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you please tell me how much we owe you?
What  s in the bag? Underwear? To seduce your husband? Or is it for your own recreation? Tell me, how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because he does it with little children?
You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
I  ve had a long and unpleasant day. I  m tired and I  m angry. But mad? Not yet. I paid Leon  s boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why haven  t you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
You know he  d have had him killed, don  t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
When did you learn about his taste for kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it woman  s intuition? Or just the way he fucked you?
Huh! Don  t you recall convincing me he had? You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
How... When did you...
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He  s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Adonis thought your brother  s body  d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn  t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Leon  s not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leon  s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I  d exceeded his expectations.
Leon didn  t hang himself, Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell.
Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You  d have been ready for me when I turned up with  Sleeping Beauty . Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention.  Not Leon,  you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn  t say  My God! , or whatever else well bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved.  Not Leon.  Who then? You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman I  d stopped thinking. Nothing added up Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at  15, 000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didn  t you?
Oh no. At long last Leon had found a mission. He  d never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your husband killed your brother. And thanks to you, almost got me killed too.
That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
One just doesn  t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
I don  t.
Is there anything to understand?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
Five years of it. Surely, you  d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
And you still haven  t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier  s being tailed?
Something like that?
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Where is that?
Don  t you believe in simplicity?
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it  s never that complicated really.
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
To get me killed...?
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother  s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
No. Not us...
The staff don  t know yet... I called my parents, told them everything... I just couldn  t take any more...
My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil... And his drowning was arranged...
What do you suggest?
Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
You  re a long way from home...
You... Jesus Christ!
By your Austrian?
There are over 4 million people in this city why me?
I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it won  t be for a couple of hours.
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy  s out. How do you plan to leave the U. S., Mr Lombard?
Like you  ll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
Did you not enter this country illegally?
Right... Well, I  ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay? Okay. Goodnight then.
Don  t fall asleep with your hair wet.
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There  s a dirt track with a  Closed to the public  sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven  t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
I think so. And if it comes to it, tell the cops anything you think will make them move. Whatever you came up with couldn  t come close to how bad it is. Bye now.
Some Italian I picked up back there. He  s in the boot of the Mustang.
Who knows. Who cares... You wanted slime. You got slime.
Do you know a friendly cop?
I  m finished here and I  m tired, Emily. You shouldn  t be here. Now don  t make it worse.
Then find another way.
My ex husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks I  m obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son. But he  s a good guy. He  ll listen to you. He won  t turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay?
I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex husband?
Most of our information comes out of the mouths of babes, Mr Lombard confused and frightened victims. It  s all too easily discredited, you understand. Now, you might be just what we  ve been waiting for. Your information could be enough to make  em sit up and listen.
No. You  re looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there. Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit... Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say?
I saw the ad at George  s. I  m passing through town and I  m in a hurry.
Why?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months. Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
We also provide 24 hour after sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
So, what are you looking for?
How much of a hurry are you in?
I  m afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
Have the money ready by 11am. We  ll call you.
Yes. Friedman  s the fuckin  Austrian!
I don  t know. He  s gone! He  s gone. I don  t fucking know where, I swear... He  s gone. On holiday...
Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus, man, my knees...
What  s this place? A hotel of some kind?
Where?
Where are we?
Where are the kids?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
And who does Friedman work for?
What company?
How many of you scumbags are here?
What  s the Ambassador?
What about the staff? They  re in on what  s going on, aren  t they? How many of them?
Where is it?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
Must be your lucky day then. I  ve got your accounts you don  t owe much tax for last year.
Yes. But my boss reckons you  d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It  d cost you about  100 but he said it  d be worth it. Of course, you  d need a partner to register. But that  s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
 La collectionoose . It  s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It  s on TV tonight and as I  m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it  s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director  s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
I don  t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
So you haven  t seen the film, then?
Oh... We split up.
Oh no. I  m all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?
Hello there. How  s the flat. I cleaned...
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be. Maybe it  s there with...
Well, I  m sorry. I... This is my nephew... And my brother, Tim. I  ve got the week off and he  s come to stay.
I  d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can  t, don  t worry about it. I  ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I  m in a hurry.
Carlos De Moraes?
Thank you, Jane.
What if it is?
Must I speak to you in French?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
Check with your son  s bank. Banks don  t usually give out information about their customers.
I didn  t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
I presume you checked your son  s apartment...
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
Then why aren  t you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?
Any friends?
I  m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
Anything at all. I presume you won  t want to take the boy with you when you  re finished? There  s a  500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand?
Uh huh. You could  ve waited for me inside.
Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate.
Clients come and go.
Huh, I doubt it... Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
Don  t jump any red lights.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Maybe I don  t.
I  m overcome by your public spiritedness.
Could someone have hurt you that bad?
Is this Friedman, Martin? Come on, scumbag. You  ve reached your sell by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he  s using?
You seem very sure about that.
What is?
The Hyatt...? What  s that?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
You must agree to be blindfolded... Just for the journey. It might appear unseemly you  re the paying customer but ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement.
Leon? No. I  m afraid he left.
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
I  m sorry...
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
What  s a French private investigator doing here?
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
... Leon  s not here. How did you get here? Phil doesn  t know where I live.
You thought wrong. I haven  t seen Leon for months.
You you  re wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time I  m in London. That  s all.
He just said he had good reasons.
That  s what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldn  t take on another child, that he  d get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasn  t listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think he  s back on drugs, eh? Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self destruct phase, you know? Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some people  s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leon  s. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
Yeah... But he didn  t beat the demons... A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent  s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
They  re German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. It  s not guilt, more of a curse... And then there  s something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think that  s just one of Leon  s dark delusions...
Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
Is she on the phone?
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon  s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
I  ve been away. Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Fine...
I hear you  re looking for Leon. That makes me, his old lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leon  s gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
No shit... Well, I  m afraid I can  t help you.
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge. You don  t know Leon, do you?
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just ain  t worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of  em.
What about which girlfriend?
Oh. That  d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I don  t really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. That  s how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
Yeah. Why? You  re going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Viens.
Mon bureau co  tait trop cher.
Le montage, l  emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors  stuff. How much would it cost me?
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
I don  t have your credentials, Nathalie.
They lost their son. Why?
Are they still operative?
Mossad?
What do you mean?
... if she can find me? That's a brilliant idea! If she's really been sent by God she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man! Bring her up!
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Good. Until then, feel free to live like a king!
10, 000 gold crowns.
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God? Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne we let her she got caught. Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30, 000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no. And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no. Jean, open your eyes can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Yes. I didn't confess today.
Better today than tomorrow.
I thought you were an archer?
The King of England. I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there.
There's nothing to hear I haven't done anything. And why haven't I done anything? Because none of you will listen to me!!
Alright, whatever but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly!
Good.
No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
Come with me...
It's over, Jeanne. We won, just as you said!
Because there's an arrow in your leg.
It's been weeks since they spoke to me. Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
It's not time yet. My mission is not over yet. There is still more I must do before I can really finally go home.
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
I don't know it. I feel it.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
Tell the king to give me more men.
It's a trap! They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
No, but...
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once for Jeanne?
To be killed in battle?
Do as I say!
That's an order!
I'm already free...
One day you will.
No, you must come, Jeanne we need you so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore... You can't stay they'll burn you!
Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
We have to press home the attack!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
But that was her order!
No...
No. But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
I leave the answer to God.
Didn't you also carry a banner?
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
And why was that? Did it have some particular value or power?
And?
Why?
Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
No! I warned the English to go back home I begged them not to force us to fight they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
Yes, probably... maybe...
Yes, but...
No, I... I held it up to...
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
No, I... I never killed anyone!
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
No no, you don't understand this is no ordinary oil this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown King Clovis in this... very... cathedral...
Rouen is in English territory. I have the right to do anything I like. Take them away.
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is. This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Scared to make a mistake. Supposing she's right... supposing she really has been sent by God??
Well find some other way! Be creative. Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that? Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Guess.
God defeated the English, not me.
I was so worried we've all been looking for you! The English are everywhere! O thank you, lord!
Don't worry about me just stay in here... and don't move!
I'll be right here... I promise.
Who are you?
Trial? What trial??
But... the King my king didn't he pay my ransom?
The English??
How old are you?
Were you baptized?
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
I assure you they do. So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
When exactly? A day, a week when?
The voice was in your cell?
What did it tell you?
Did it give you advice? Good advice?
Is it here? Now? In this room?
As often as you like now, please for the love of God sign!!
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
Thanks be to God.
Not so well, I regret to say. This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment. That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
This word is regrettably appropriate for the situation. In fact what we the Church wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims. You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
Mmmm. Yes. I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart. I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
You're a fine judge of character, Charles. It'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she's a fake. But if she's not then she will give you your answers... and place the crown on your head.
I... I can't stop her.
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
I know you're not yet but you will be, soon.
I didn't wait long. One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
... and my crown doesn't fit and... Really??
Why did you betray me? Paris was ours for the taking! All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
So how would you put it?
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
You mustn't see her, my lord. We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
If she comes from Burgundy it makes a difference. It might be a trap... Look... Signed " X ". What sort of name is " X "? Or must we conclude that a messenger of God can't even write her own name?
The other half.
Supposing she's an assassin?
... as always, majesty...
Let them come! Let them see who's the true king of France!
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Does he have hair?
Is it long and hanging down?
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him? By what he said?
That's enough! You will answer the question... or face the consequences!
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings. His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
Good. Where are the English?
It's coming I rode on ahead. I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
Good. Can you bring me to him?
Because... because I mean the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil. What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Well. I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
Fine go now if you want, but not with me! You may have a duty to God but I have a duty to my people, and my people are starving! So right now I'm going to take the food back to the city, and if you can please calm down, and let me accompany you to Orleans, it will be my honor to welcome you.
What complicated about it? All you have to do is do what you're told what could be simpler than that? I'm the drum on which God is beating out his message beating so loudly it's bursting my ears but you're all so full of your own voices, you're deaf to His!
Ah, so that's it. To you I'm just a girl.
Knowing what I know? Enormous gratitude.
Sooner is better than later!
The wind will be with us! Do as I say.
The bridge won't wait!
The English won't wait.
Oh, but I forgot! It was a Sunday... that explains it. God's day off.
Good idea...
The English are rebuilding it.
For weeks you've been asking for this... well now you have it!
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Reinforcements? Where??
Never look behind only ahead!
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
He never sent them... Don't you understand? He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
To hell with your voices it's time to face facts! We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you. You should go home, Jeanne.
Did your voice tell you to jump?
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
How can you deny it when you just said " I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English "...?
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin? No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
And you didn't jump of your free will?
Oh? Perhaps someone pushed you then?
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Because... because you just can't!
La Hire, I'm warning you don't swear!
Were the men confessed? Where are the priests?
Not for long...
It's not possible...
If you kill him, you kill me!
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
Everything! Prison humiliation being abandoned and betrayed by everyone I can't stand it anymore I'd rather die!
I... I never lied!
I am true to my Lord, the King of Heaven. He knows how much I love him that's all that matters to me...
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace? You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
Why? Are you waiting for someone else?
Who?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
No, no you can't stay or they won't come!
Because... I have to be alone!
Why would they?
God asked you to do something?
You mean God said, " I need you, Jeanne? "
What signs?
No. That was a sword in a field.
True every event has an infinite number of causes but why pick one rather than another? There are many ways a sword might find itself in a field...
Yes... yes! And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's " the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life... " he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery? Why didn't he?
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
Yes! We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
No, no, you did fine. I'd even say well done. Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
I agree...
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define. When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
Really?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
No, I...
Are you going to leave me too?
Are you sent by God?
Yes...
Let's see.
But you already confessed this morning...
So... alright. What terrible sin have you committed since then that can't wait till tomorrow to be forgiven?
They weren't my shoes. Mine were too small.
My father's.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Is that bad?
Oh yes... very.
Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
Then... why are you here so often?
Him?
Who is this " he "?
What... does he... look like?
Only God knows the answer to that.
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive. It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
Jeanne... calm down...! Calm down, Jeanne!
I want to be with him always...
I want to be at one with Him now.
Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they hang them for helping Jews.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
He's still a doctor.
Who are you?
It's nothing.
Really?
No one plays Chopin like you.
How are you doing?
Don't worry, it won't last long.
I'll see you... soon.
Come in! come in!
Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
Calm down, what, what is it?
Funny time to say this.
Wish I knew you better.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Can you help?
Can you help us?
I've no money.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
People I know. They said you're an important man.
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
I'm doing you people a favour. And what about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms. Join us. You've got no work...
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this. In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
A good place for what? He's insane!
That's better than yesterday.
I know.
What are you talking about, my tie? What's my tie got to do with anything? I need the tie for my work.
What did you pay him?
I can look after myself!
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
That's also my business.
Otherwise what?
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else? Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see.
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
Bad news, you crazy? You have no world view, Wladek, that's your trouble. The news couldn't be better. The moment Hitler invaded Russia, I knew we'd be all right. Remember Napoleon. Same business. The Germans will freeze to death, please God.
But I want to help, I want to.
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
Why didn't you come to me?
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Please, don't insult us. Can you do something for him?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends. I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
Be ready to leave in two days'time. Same place as last night.
I've been worried sick.
Out of Warsaw.
I'm not going anywhere.
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.
You have spare wife here Peini. You get rnana for that. Our chief four wives.
I miss you.
But we came down this way didn't we? I'm sure we did.
Yes
What for?
The piano on the beach? Ada's piano?
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
Yes, I suppose you would.
You don't want to learn.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
No, words. You have never heard words?
No, but her words are in my head. I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
Everyone has to practice.
Jesus! I'll kill him! I'll kill him. What did she tell him?
It's quite safe, they are managing...
I have the key here, look, I'll have it mended...
A piano?
He wants to improve himself... and you will be able to play on it... Teach him to look after it.
She never gives him a turn.
Play a song then
Lieutenant Snyder. Bunco.
I'm lookin'for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap. Thought he mighta come in here.
All right if I look around your lobby?
Nobody. I just know what kinda women he likes. I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
7 to 2. That ain't bad.
No, no cops!
You're crazy carryin'that kinda money in this neighborhood. No wonder you got hit.
You ain't goin'nowhere on that leg.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
I dunno. That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already what if he's out there waitin'around a corner with some friends.
Sorry, pal. I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
What makes you think you can trust him? He didn't do shit.
You got a bag or somethin?
How'bout a handkerchief?
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky. We can't afford to rank the joint.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown. Gondorff is Federal.
How much did ya lose?
In one goddamn night? What are ya sprayin'money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp. I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
No class grifter woulda'done it, that's all.
I think it's the best...
I'm gettin'too slow for this racket. I done the best I'm gonna do. You hang on too long, you start embarrassin'yourself.
It's nothin'compared to what you could be makin'on the Big Con. You're wastin'your time workin'street marks.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker. You know everything I know. You got nothin'more to learn from me.
And I'm tellin'ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it. A bigger fool than I was. I been lookin'for this one all my life, Johnny. Now I got a chance to step out at the top.
I'm out, Johnny.
That's the way I want it.
Then why ain't he dead?
Use Salino. It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house. Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can. I don't wanta be here all night.
We cleared 22 here.
They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16. 5 is Gary, and 20 in Cicero. Looks like you're bringing up the rear, Granger.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
He was a tear off rat. He got what he deserved. No sense helpin'pay his bills.
Straight north. He was gonna take it all and run.
We were partners. If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin'pinball down at Gianelli's. I don't need anything more than I got.
There's always a depression on.
I like griftin'.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
Listen to me, Hooker. What ever you do, don't go back to your place tonight, don't go anyplace you usually go, ya hear me? Get outa town or somethin', but...
It's important. We had a little trouble in Chicago today. One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Mottola.
I don't know. Could be. We're runnin'that down now.
They're still looking for him.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed. They figure maybe he skipped town. You wanna follow'em up?
Good lad.
I don't care. Load me a deck. Set it up for threes and nines. I'll cut it in on his deal.
Nothin'. They gotta be outa there early. I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.
Got to. Gondorff's ridin'the mark in from New York on the Century.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand. That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand. I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get'em though.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya? It's gonna take hours just to clean it up. Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item. Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
All he's gotta do is read.
I can talk, can't I?
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal. A real lop ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric. Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
No, I lammed it around for a while while things cooled off. Philly, Denver, Baltimore, nuthin'towns.
Lonnegan after you, too?
You never do, kid.
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
Yeh, he croaked Luther. What else do I gotta know.
I'll take him anyway.
' Cause I don't know enough about killin'to kill him.
This isn't like playin'winos on the street. You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money. And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
Right down to my socks, turkey. If I'da been half as scared a that lop ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on'em. Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
If I can find a mob that'll risk it. But no matter what happens, I don't want you comin'back to me halfway through and sayin'it's not enough... cause it's all you got.
You know, somebody tailin'ya. A torpedo or somethin'.
And?
Hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin'through to'em.
No.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet. You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains. And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me.
Luther always told me to bite my toenails when I get nervous. You see yourself doin'that and you realize it ain't worth it.
Two or three hundred I guess. Sometimes played two a day when I was in Shea's mob. We had it down to a business.'Course Chicago was a right town then. The fix was in. The dicks took their end without a beef. All the Wall Street boys wanted to make investments for us. Even had marks looking us up, thinkin'they could beat the game. Yeh, kid, it really stunk. No sense in bein'a grifter if it's the same as bein'a citizen.
Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.
I appreciate your stickin'your neck out. I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
You wanta wait for your share?
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  100 minimum, straight poker. Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
That's why he won't know it.
Get a couple extra guys in the line, then. We'll give him the shut out.
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza. I got you one of each. He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
See and raise five.
Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie. He's got the name for bettin'money he don't have.
What are the odds on Syphon?
Who are you?
How do I know you're tellin'the truth.
Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station. Have you made any purchases here today?
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
We'll get'em! Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know. We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh? You think I'm wearin'this rag here'cause I like it? Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin'when you got a badge. I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people. You try to help'em and they spit on you. I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin'false notes.
Thank you. You don't know how much I appreciate this.
It isn't any better.
She don't work here no more. I'm fillin'in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
I don't know. Depends what train I get on.
You doin'anything tonight?
Look, I don't have time to fuck around. There's somebody out there I don't need to see. You got a fire escape or anything?
All right, do me a favor. Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake.
I don't mean nothin'by it. I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin'out here in the hall.
Tomorrow, after 4: 00. Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya. And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
You gonna have a go here? How'bout a ten spot on the line here. The 4 9 been lookin'good today. Lotsa action on 28th Street down there, too. Pay ya 10 1.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
What do you mean?
So could Shaw.
Cause I'm tired of bein'his nigger. I want you to help me break him.
All right, then.
I'm a banker, friend. That's legit in this state.
Maybe a couple million.
If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming.
Get on with it then.
You're not gonna break him with a  2, 000 bet.
And you were gonna pay me back?
Lucky, hell. I could do it every day.
' Cause it's better to do it all at once. We're puttin'down 400 grand next week. At 5 1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
It's foolproof. We got a partner downtown runs the central office of the Western Union. Race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies. All he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner. Then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that's already been run. It can't miss, unless the Western Union Dicks get onto it.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.
No.
Oh, Jesus.
I don't know, figure something out.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb. You wouldn't wanna lie to me. Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin'in this town.
Like hell. You won't even get a review till you're seventy. And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin'there later.
I mean completely played. Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him. You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
Just as long as I get to finish the play.
But who says you will. I got a guy I can depend on. He's liquidating everything he has for this. You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
On a 6 1 shot? The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
You weren't hired to miss him.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
All right, get outa here. You're outta work.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way. How much a week?
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Well we do. He's chummin'around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here. We got a year old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold. All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin'him. If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin'Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin'him off. But it's not gonna happen this time. We're not even gonna let the police know we're here. If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya. And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
I think he will.
Oh. I'll do my own typing!
He's just forgotten. You know he forgets everything.
Why did that man want to kill him?
Do you suppose.....?
You better take a drink.
It's the same one.
And if it isn't?
I can't help it. You don't know.....
I can't.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
And don't ever try to see me again.
Please! You can't get mixed up in this.
You don't understand. You don't know what's going to happen.
I can't marry you! I can't ever marry you!
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children? It'd be fun, wouldn't it? Maybe they'd murder each other... keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done. He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
Why not? I am crazy.... the whole family's crazy.
Go away!
Why not?
Oh, here she is.
No.
That's gone long ago. I've got to see him. Where is he?
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Then what are you hiding?
You hand that over to the police.
All right, then. I'll tell them.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Did he tell you where he was going?
Tch tch tch Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant. You wouldn't drive slowly, so you don't get a tip.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
You don't remember me..... I'm Dorothy Wynant.
How did you ever remember me?
Probably not.
That's what I was going to ask you. he's disappeared!
That's it... Herbert Macaulay.
Why don't you try him again?
Thanks. We will. Goodbye.
There.
Yes. I hated her for coming between my mother and father. She kept me from seeing my father. I went down there to ask her where he was. She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
Why... in the heart.
She fell down.
I don't know.
She... she fell over backwards.
Don't lie to me.
Take a good look at him, Dad. Now please try to remember him...'cause he's going to be your son in law.
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
I hate all that fuss. But I'll do it on one condition that you're there to give me away.
This is my wedding.
He can stay home. Please, Dad, won't you?
It's a secret. I can't even tell you, my dear. I've got an important idea to work on.
Yes. And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
That's one thing I won't forget. Where's Macaulay? I ought to be starting.
I know I know
He's a brave man.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Goodbye, darling. Don't you dare forget... December 30th.
That woman!
Was there much blood?
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
Know. But I saw him
Yes. I might not have been shot.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
Nothing.
Ask him. I don't know.
Keep on asking.
Ever heard of the Sullivan Act?
Who's is it?
Okay. There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better. Come on.
That ain't a gun any more. The firing pin's busted the Don't waste time talking about that.
I thought it might be. From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
For one thing, he was too absent minded to hold a grudge.
I haven't got that far yet. But I don't think that everything points to Wynant. What about the alibis?
What about Jorgensen?
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
He's holding out on you.
Who're you calling?
Trail him! Trail who?
This is enough for me.
Extraordinarily lucky.
Could this be him?
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Just the same, Wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way, would he? How long should you say this body'd been here, Doc?
Why didn't you tell me?.... Why didn't you hold him?
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
Well....
He telephoned me today.
I wasn't in. My secretary took the message. He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
About three.
Yes. But he didn't show up.
I didn't know they had a fight.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it'til we came?
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
Are you sure you didn't leave the room... that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched. He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
Goodbye.
Tell'em.
You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.
That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth. Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth. All right. Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
That's a lie, Lieutenant... Anybody that says that is a liar.
I didn't mean you, Mister.
Where were you?
Just give me a minute.... I'll remember. I'm not stalling, Lieutenant. You know I always come clean with you. Gee, it'd serve me right if you had pinched me... that's the afternoon I was.... wait, I'll show you...!
I'll get some.
I know.
Chris!
I couldn't go near that woman.
You wouldn't do that... you wouldn't!
Chris Chris!
Why, you said...
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
I don't like him.
No. I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
The government bonds. The ones you took from the office safe.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Now see here, Julia. You're counting a little too much on my being absent minded. You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it. But this is fifty thousand dollars!
No one else had the combination of that safe. You took them. What did you do with them?
That's my business.
They'll be pretty rough with you.... with your record.
I'll give it back to you.... all I've got.... twenty five thousand...
I can't! I haven't got it!
I never had it.
Oh, he's sitting up.
I'm not telling anyone.
That's just why I'm going.
I wish you'd count them. There's a thousand dollars there.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
Well, let me do that for you.
Settle it yourself. What have I got a lawyer for?
No.
Dorothy told me you were here. I was going to telephone but....
She usually is. Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er er sleuthing for her.
You don't say
I see. I see.
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money... I give it to her and she gives it to him.
S'long.
That's all right.
It wouldn't hurt to put it in.
Hello.... Where? In Allentown. Yes... When is the next train? Right I'll get that. Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him. I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it? That looks like an admission of guilt. And I had such hopes. I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him. I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that.... Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now. I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time.
Want to talk to you about something very important.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him... I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all. He thinks I just want money.
You're always teasing.
But he knows you. All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Dorothy! Is she here?
All right, then I'll tell them who did do it!
Oh, did he? What did he say?
It isn't a story it's true. I did see Wynant. He's not dead.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted
All right you didn't.
Why tell me?
That's all swell. Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
How is Studsy? I didn't know he was out of stir.
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this. Ask the police.
I am on the level. If I knew anything I'd....
Why do you say that?
Thank you. Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders Three months ago the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man. He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
I thought so. He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant. What I've gone through
You got types?
Who is she?
By the way, how is your father's side?
How many drinks have you had?
Six Martinis. You're not going to have anything on me.
Room service, please
Rye.
What are you going to do with it?
Good. I want to talk to you.
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
No.
No thanks.
I'd like to see you work.
I think I would like that drink. I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
What are you going to give me? I hope I don't like it.
There's one coming.
Sure I don't even feel it.
Yeah.
On it! I'm in it... They think I did it!
Who gave it to you?
You must admit I have good taste.
Macaulay.
Is that another Christmas present?
Did I give it to you?
Philadelphia. Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Oh take it! Please take it!
Sit down!
All right, hard guy. Get up and bleed on the rugs.
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
But Wynant?
Why don't you?
So am I.
He's just been for a walk.
What are you going to do?
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Nick I won't have you going down there.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
Go on go on see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
You bet I wouldn't.
You dog!
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
I don't care I'm just used to you, that's all If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
What do you mean?
Nick!
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
Wynant's body?
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Nick, you'll drive me crazy. What things?
What things made you so sure?
Well, don't they?
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
Wynant dead? Does Dorothy know?
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Why not?
What are you going to do?
Yes!
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
I've got a lulu why?
The suspects! They won't come.
Who do you think did it?
Mimi!
I wish you'd tell me who.
Why are you saying it?
I hope you're well.
How did you get in here?
You worked here?
Well, that's a hot one. You a bookkeeper! When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Trying to put it off on her?
You can save that and tell it to the police. They'll be here in a minute.
You his wife?
He's a good guy. He sent me up the river once. Hey, Nick!
Bonds, sir?
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase. It's at the Grand Central.
I just wanted to tell you...
Home?
Who fired you?
What's in the other direction?
Turn the car around.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
I'd settle for being alive. Really. Alive would be fine.
Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.
He's not so
How tough you have to be to make the army? All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.
Should have blown already. Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
Break it out.
Should have at least gotten the map off of him. Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
There's nothing we can do. We shouldn't even be here in the first place.
We're not going to find anything standing here. Let's get to climbing.
Picks up again just on the other side.
Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
Weird they didn't chase us.
Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up. Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
What about it?
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold. Maybe you've already got things worked out.
Maybe I don't need your ideas. Maybe I can do better on my own.
Get off him!
He... he could have been watching us.
That's what he says. He could be a spy, or something.
You don't know he isn't.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
It's a combat action.
Then step aside.
Get out of my way.
In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you. I suppose.
Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.
Wes
That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that. It doesn't change me respecting you. And now you let me down. I expected more from you, you know? I really did. I expected you to
So you can give us away?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm killing Iraqis. At at at at at. At at at at
Don't get pissed at me, just'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
Another month in this desert and I might just.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.
I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
But we all got to be in for this. We all go, or we do nothing.
A car? You're going to buy a car?
Invest it.
It's not about being fun. It's about being smart. You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever. That's freedom. That's what I'm talking about.
You know, you sound just like a boy who's never
TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
We can see them, they can see us. We run, they chase.
They're not going to
Let's go.
You can't tell anybody about this.
And you missed this? How are you going to miss something like this?
Yeah. I know. I'm with you.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all. Just a sip.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now. Nobody uses delayed fuse mines anymore.
It's a mine, isn't it?
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
Why you got to move away to talk!?
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!? It's going to blow up!
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
That's going to do it, right? I'm going to be okay.
You don't know that. It could be a trick.
Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
Where the hell is it!?
They're going to kill us!
It looks like you're not doing anything.
Get up and dig.
Get up off your ass and dig!
Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
You don't have to imagine it. Not anymore. Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you.
He's not going to leave us.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.
There's another pass on the photo. We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it. We're heading Northeast.
How!?
We can't just leave him.
What if he's not?
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
They'll search the pack.
And you; you've got it all together.
That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.
I never killed anybody before. I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
Really, I'm not. Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis? That's all it was was talk. I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
What? Yeah.
I don't want to die.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
I never had anything before, Epps. I never was anybody. Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins. When I was in high school I used to
Epps... Epps! I'm gonna stop for a second.
Just let me rest for a second.
You know what I'm going to do? I'm just going to take a second. I want to look at the gold.
I just want to look at it. Remind me of what I'm dying for.
Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive. He's gone. Time for a new deal.
Which boarder? Saudi? Kuwait? Syria?
Yeah, I guess we should.
They must be Saudis. It's a Saudi checkpoint. Oh sweet, Jesus. Come on. Come on!
What are we going to do?
And then shoot them.
Well, you're going to start with a bang,'cause you've got four of them to take down.
Shoot them!
Is that good, or bad?
Why haven't they killed us!?
... Maybe... maybe we can fight our way out.
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
Maybe... maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
It wasn't the gold. It was the claymore mine. The gold's in my pack.
It's always been like that. When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better... take precautions. I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack. Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
We had a deal. No one touches the gold until we're out of here. No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
You shouldn't think about things like that. It'll just make you crazy.
How do we do that?
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Yeah, but why me? What if the car doesn't stop?
I want you to know... I don't know. I just think you're a hell of a guy.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes. You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here. And you've been fair too. I mean, even after I... you know...
Yeah. Even after that. You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now. But I'd say you've been very fair. I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Still am. There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now... Where should I go?
I've never been anywhere. I wouldn't know where to go. Where would you go?
I'd go to Australia. Lot of land, not many people. I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile. And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
That's what I hear. Don't matter. Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.
I'm looking for a favor. I need a map of Iraqi.
Ready for what? Sight seeing?
Saddam's got a boil on his ass?
Yeah, a headache. My head hurts. You're making me uncomfortable.
Yes. Yes. That's exactly it. Yes.
People are suffering.
Oh yeah. Accidently.
I'm just trying to help you guys out. It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
How do you say " Come here, baby. I'm horny. " I can use that now.
What is it? You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.
It's a puzzle box. If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
You will. You'll get it.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
That's in two days.
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes. No more drills. We stand at full ready starting
We're going to war, aren't we. If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
Why would they do all that if we weren't?
You ever think about dying?
You ever think about it? You ever worry?
At at at at at.
With... with millions. Millions of dollars.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to. And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know
It's not a hundred miles. It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain: Pure desert, mountains, a river. If the map is even real.
So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase? It's crazy. Tell him it's crazy, Epps.
You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive.
Yeah. If. Whatever. What kind you figure it is?
Yeah! Gold! How much?
Two vehicles. They're not supposed to be here.
They're not... I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here!
You see that? Right by us. They went right by. You had them Epps; you called it.
We got to get out of here.
We just about got killed. You know what happened? We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
As soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway. We're not that far. We can make it.
Really? What is that, an order, private?
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
You want to crawl, crawl.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
What do you see?
I think he wants something to drink.
You actually got around to killing someone. I'm impressed. I guess you're only half a bitch.
Stress category.
Birth born.... UMMM... Sexact.
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
Correct.
See if you can get a reading on tactal retention. Try to estimate it without a meter reading.
Too low.
No, Tetanty.
You know I don't feel well.
When?
Now?
A shift change should come through the scheduling office.
I have to... he's a G 34
No, don't make trouble. It's nothing.
That's not dirt... Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
Looks like food.
I said what time is it? How long was I out?
Three! I'm going to be late for my shift.
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there. I have to go.
I'll try.
You're not cleared for this precinct. Let's cross over first.
On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
Then what? It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
They're watching us now.
It's the end.
It's wrong; so wrong, what we've done....
What?
Who? Who's leaving?
But you can't. We must escape.
Not very encouraging.
No one could have imagined anything one thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry. This world is in a state of static mobility: we are at the same time moving and standing still.
What?
What's going on?
Where's LUH?
You're in violation.
I'll report you. It's....
Get out of here, Leave me alone.
Right now.
... and you're not lost now?
Lost SEN! He'll never find us.
Maternity ward, huhh!
Who? Me?... I don't know.
I don't know.
Oh, That! I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
What have you done, Cut your hand?
Shut up.
You don't know that!
Look more closely.
Save yourself....
Yes.
... rooms with her. Our relationship is normal, conforming. We share nothing but space. What is she doing to...
... to me. I think I'm dying.
They're not here.
And you are...?
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you
F 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I
Damn.
We've got one hour. Are you coming or not?
Now wait just a fucking
Treat. We treat devices.
Don't push it, slick.
Only once, at Redstone.
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us " punks " happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Drive.
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C. I. A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver?
No, ninety ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere...
Bingo!
Right.
Why do you do it?
Which one's which?
You don't have to talk about it.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.
Driving in circles, waiting for
How do you know?
Should we head for the Interstate?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
What do we do?
Okay, let's go in.
What's wrong?
Make up your mind, trigger.
Which one's which?
What...?
How the hell do you feel yellow?
Right.
Oh shit...
Bev, give  em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
He's my brother...
I know. I warned them.
Alex, please.
C'mon, it's a quiet night.
You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens...
You don't fish.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
No thanks. I got close but it never woulda worked.
I thought you said what's her name's brother was going to fix it.
What was it this time?
Take your time... one day at a time, kid...
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
Sir, I
Look, I saw these guys, I can i. d. them.
Yes, sir.
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
I didn't. But I had to try.
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
It's our only option.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business
You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon.
Pull back. You're only an observer.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, have you found it?
Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute.
Yes, M'sieu Laval!
Niente!
Tonsili!
Well then it must be my mistake. I beg your pardon.
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
You've never been in Venice?
No.
No.
No.
No!
Yes!
But
And harems...?
You're looking fine, Major.
No color, no sparkle but dependable.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Like it?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
Insignificant... He's a secretary, always was a secretary, always will be.
Doc!
Yes, Baron.
I would start with cocktails.
And, waiter you see that moon?
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
I want to see
And as for you, waiter
I don't want to see you at all!
Thank you.
You can trust me.
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family
And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
Two weeks and three days.
Are you insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
I don't know, M'sieu Giron!
But not now.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron
Very well, m'sieu.
Yes, m'sieu. M'sieu Giron!
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about about sixty five. Let's see You will be exactly eighty seven when you come out of prison.
You say I am a crook.
Then why didn't you call the police? Why don't you call the police? I'll tell you why you crook, you.
Monescu.
Just call me Gaston.
Thank you, Major.
Good day, Major.
No, Captain, I tell you
The tennis player?
But you came. And you must forget everything except that you are here, Countess.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And she will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me but I don't care!
But she talks a lot. And before this night is over, all Venice will know it. And tomorrow it will be Grand Canal gossip!... Oh!
Thank you!
Disappointed?
Please.
The pepper, too?
You're very welcome. Countess, believe me, before you left this room I would have told you everything... And let me say this with love in my heart Countess, you are a thief. The wallet of the gentleman in two fifty three, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket. In fact, you tickled me. But your embrace was so sweet...
What time is it?
Monescu!
Gaston!
Yes! Don't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the Royal Palace and made it into a lamp for my night table?
Right.
The fourteenth of May.
The six
Two fifty three, five
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
No jewelry! Hands off jewelry! If we're broke all right. I might pick up a million franc necklace. But in times like these when we're doing a cash business why take a chance on jewelry?
But it's not enough!
Did you ever take a good look at her uh
They're all right, aren't they?
Gaston. Let's open it right now! Let's get away from here! I don't like this place!
Darling, remember you're Gaston Monescu. You're a crook. I want you as a crook. I love you as a crook. I worship you as a crook. Steal, swindle, rob but don't become one of those useless, good for nothing gigolos!
Five, seven, and nine
No not yet but Two tickets to Berlin first class and sleeper night train... Right... Right... Leave them in the name of Don Ignacio Fernandez... Right... Thank you.
Correct. Now the train leaves
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station midnight. Hello... Yes? What?... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late!
By the way, how is your German?
Also, um zwoelf Uhr.
Auf wiedersehn.
Now, Lily
You have to get out of here!
Don't you realize
Lily, you must listen to me.
But, Lily
Leave me alone! You were willing to sacrifice a hundred thousand francs for her. Well she's worth it!  You were willing to pay a hundred and twenty five thousand for a handbag. You can pay a hundred thousand for him! 
That's it! Yes, that's it!... Jacques!
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Then you go into the foyer.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
You like that statue?
Neither do I. That's where I found it.
Oh... That's strange. Maybe are you sure this is your bag?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag one has to be careful.
And I am M'sieu Laval if you will allow me to introduce myself.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue? Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and Oh, yes, this letter from Major
Naturally I did.
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and should, get love letters.
But one suggestion, madame. Not the major. I don't mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery no bouquet no... And one lipstick... Scarlet number four.
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
That's what you need!
What shade of powder do you use?
That's too dark.
But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.
Yes.
Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately.
Make it out to cash!
Early eighteenth century. I should say around seventeen thirty.
Beautiful specimen.
Oh?
I see. She must have been very happy here.
Isn't that wonderful! You see, madame
No! Not enough! In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
Then you use the wrong lipstick
It's disgraceful!
Everything!... Madame Colet, if I were your father which, fortunately, I am not
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking in a business way, of course.
The same thing.
I'll be delighted.
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Then riding together.
Then lunch in the Bois
Then a little nap
Beautiful.
Marvelous.
Good night.
Goodbye.
Precisely.
No yours, madame.
Yes, I would!
Like that!
And you're going to fall for them.
Any minute I want!
But attractive
Shut up kiss me! Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments!
I'm crazy about you!
I love you.
Then why do you want to go?
But I don't want to be a lady.
I wouldn't say anything I would act.
Instantly.
But why talk about robbery on a night like this?
Mariette!
You have been robbed for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
Adolph J. Giron.
Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it.
Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans'Asylum. Adolph J. Giron distinguished citizen!... Well, shall I call the police? I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up a self made crook then you say, " Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up! "
It could have been marvelous...
Wonderful... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant then you'll be glad you're alone.
Lovely.
Goodbye...
To M'sieu Laval?
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
Yes, that's the trouble with mothers. First you get to like them and then they die.
May I?
About what?
Naturally not!
To me he seems rather nervous.
No, he works too much. He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work
Yes! And he would have a little more time for
Right!
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. Five o'clock remember!
I beg your pardon!
Mademoiselle Gautier or whatever your name is I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money
But you're the more intelligent one.
Then why did you do it?
You should have more self control. You were in the army.
Didn't you take it with you?
No I'm sorry.
Yes, I saw it but
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder.
You're certain?
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
I'm tryin'boss.
Get that outta my face.
Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L. A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead.
Rush her.
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory. You see this? Right here?
Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are.
No, trust me, you want to take this call.
... Mrs. Calvert?
The one on the other side is letting men in.
It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
I felt like black.
He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.
An accident?!
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.
Good. Settled then.
Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.
I always win, Jack. One way or another. Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
Well I can.
Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same.
No! It's our lives now, not theirs. And I'm in charge of this boat! Now row!!
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all. Retire with a bang, eh, E. J.?
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
No you won't.
You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice fishing's where you chop a hole in the
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin'ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain. Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
Uh, yes. Of course. After you.
That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber. I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Worse I'm afraid.
So don't marry him.
It is that simple.
Well, I guess I will tonight.
May I?
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...
A whole ten cents?!
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it. Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
I think I would. And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin'that you're goin'to be alright.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
Kinda like we're doin'right now uh oh!
I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it.
It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.
Now it's worse.
Right.
See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
I'll wait here.
I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Never let go.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
I should like to see my drawing.
Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship. See the date?
It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.
Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there made my plans I'd have sent for you.
It would be a nice change from you.
You're a charming liar. You know, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours'notice
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves a few tears and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport... so who cares... I'm here with you... and that's all that matters to me.
I never want to go back....
That's fine because you're going to see a lot of me... for the rest of your life.
Yes I met Miss Marsh. In fact, she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances. What's the matter, Miss Marsh aren't you feeling well?
And do bring Miss Marsh when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
Oh a hundred times
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert. Take it easy, Lee no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me because I like you. You're such a swine!
I like touching you poison ivy. You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
No, darling, lip rouge all over your mouth.
Thanks.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening and he was gentleman enough to boast why you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
I think you do.
Lumber, ma'am spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance and now gosh darn it " Honest Jack " that's what they call me is goin'to see the world.
No o!
What did you want a gun for?
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Get moving
I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight you'll find it a rough voyage.
Yes are you?
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful.
Nice lines
You've got lipstick all over you.
You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you let me wipe it off.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
How about giving me another coat?
Wait a minute! They're dancing in the palm court
There's soft music
Have we? Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle board.
Oh, yes, I am, because afterwards up here in the moonlight.
Aw give a feller a break. My cards are on the table I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
Well breakfast? Lunch?
Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
Married?
I want you to get used to my voice you're going to hear it a lot.
Tell me.
You want to adopt him! Good for you!
Don't be a c a t.
Yes?
Don't rub it in.
When?
Sooner it you like.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
I must say you're persistent it's kind of flattering.
Thanks.
That's funny so was I. Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.
Will you take some advice? If you're looking for romance count me out if you know what's good for you.
I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high school girl looking through a window reaching for the moon. Guess I'll be going.
Let's forget it can't you see I kind of like you, too... and I don't want to get involved.
Don't let's talk about it.
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
We'll let it go at that
What?
I didn't know we were going to be married.
You're a little ahead of yourself the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring
I think we ought to walk.
Yes I remember
Who with?
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
That was the come on promise me you won't play with them again
Too much Remember I warned you about me I used to be Lee Lother's girl
He's a con man crooked as a tree and I was part of the racket helped him! Now if you have an appointment elsewhere I'll excuse you!
Come on let's take a swim.
Seven fifty. Positively my last offer.
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship.
We coulda got two third class!
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
I'll give you half of it. Here's seventy cents.
Yeah but high livin's made me soft.
A dollar forty.
Not a chance.
Until then the dollar forty stays with me.
Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job it's a marathon.
A thousand? She's one in a million right off the top of the rosebush!
Maybe she's in the show One of the troupers did you ever think of that?
My change.
A dollar forty out of the two dollars I gave you.
Right! but it doesn't have to apply to you Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
I fell in his arms Couldn't resist it.
Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie
Thank you, sir.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
Sure and to show you I'm a regular fella Here's that twenty five hundred.
Sure! McKinney will never suspect you
Why I er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
On the drunk.
Three Jacks.
Why isn't that a good time to quit?
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
No not quite.
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing Bet I could find that bracelet
Good night!
You know what I'd do, if I were you before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
I'll go with you.
This has nothing to do with me But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this run your fingers all along these seams.... Then back of the collar here that used to be a favorite trick and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe like this.
Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs like this in case they got what you're looking for attached to a string. See what I mean, Purser?
Nooooo! going to catch up on my reading. I'll take this one.
O. K. Heads you win.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Never mind I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
She was to meet me here why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
Good! At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
Yes but don't ask me why because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life but that would be enough for me I wouldn't care about easy money or showing off my smart brains I'd just like to live my life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin hers Do I make myself clear?
O. K., kid I'm only sorry for one thing.
If you hadn't agreed I was going to throw you overboard
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Then you don't have to tell her cut out New York.
Wait a minute I think I can cut out a couple o'more words.
" Will be back in four weeks. " You don't need the " will be. " Just say " Back in four weeks. "
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Cut it out.
Wait a minute What is next month?
Fine! Instead of saying " next month " we'll use one word and say " June. "
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Just a minute Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
Well, there's no use in sending it. See that I saved you seven twenty!
Pretty good thirty miles an hour
What?
I can see you're no gentleman
Yes Me in person!
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Not yet. Say, where is this boat headed for?
That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.
Well, you got the first down there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot
Not now, Toots Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me or you're dumber than I?
Never mind.
Too bad we're not making a trip around the world maybe we could finish this game. Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
He's a likable chap he's got an honest face
Oh no I don't want to impose on you It's funny about that billfold I could have sworn I had it
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way what do you know about him?
Oh, nothing only I wondered why you suspected him.
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
Yes but I didn't give it to him
Yes!
Will be as soon as the ship sails.
Are you paying any attention to his jokes? the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo Get out of here.
Just what the doctor ordered.
Swell You've got Times Square right here all but the noises
And you've put it over haven't you?
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
Still got my picture, I see I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours'notice you never asked why, but I guess you know.
It wasn't only that Ned was in a jam.
I was so crazy about him anything he did or said was O. K. by me. I introduced him to people even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter I didn't care until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned tried to make a break Lee wouldn't stand for it and well here I am!
Chad Denby broadcasting the nicest man I ever knew
Come on, now you've forgotten all about that.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
Very
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
You don't shoot squirrels.
But, Mary everybody's having such a great time why spoil it?
Well, let's hear the poem
Very good, Mary
What's the matter, Mary?
H'mm Dear Atlantic
Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole
I feel better now I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
When it falls off the table and turns turtle Cute?
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
Well, he has a straw hat
And he has sex appeal.
Get that out of your trunk.
Never mind the Who's Who Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Oh! So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
What for?
Easy kid easy.... Come on I want to talk to you.
He works the boats as a " come on " man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
The man that marks them is an artist two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks and they're worth it.
Better unlock the door. Sit up, darling, and be dignified.
I went for four.
I didn't want to see you again that's my privilege.
Why don't you leave me alone?
I wish I could.
He's all right.
You leave the kid alone.
You'd go with him!
You can't bluff me any more.
And you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
Don't be a mug all your life I'm trying to help you you need me more than I need you have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints
No!
I wouldn't say that I'm glad he's dead yes I'd thought of killing him but I didn't
Because I was yellow, I guess
He'll be back. What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
Why should I kill him?
I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
Thirty one's and two ten's?
I mean a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
Nothin I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
Aren't the roses beautiful?
I was in his cabin
I'll explain later
Well get a move on yer then get back to yer station.
Ain't got time.
Yer crazy! I ain't got no bracelet.
Because you ran after me.
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Wyatt Earp... Dodge City, right?
Well I'm the man to see. Besides Sheriff I'm also tax collector, Captain of the Fire Brigade, and Chairman of the Non partisan Anti Chinese league. A man of many Parts. Got a place to stay yet? I Also sit on the Townlot Commission. Got a couple of Lovely cottages coming up for Rent. Here, let me show you...
Actually, you know, that's not a Bad idea, send a signal we're Growing up.
That's not what I meant.
A peace officer... Impressive man
Oh, so that's it...
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight. Listen to Me! You're mine! Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
You whore! You filthy whore!
You will after tonight. Bet on it.
I asked where you got him.
Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too. Even stole a Horse once. But you can't
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final. I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin'short of dyin's gonn Stop me. Good day.
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition. Forever. I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life. That is if you don't Mind. Jesus. Good day now.
Already got a guilty conscience, Might as well have the money too.
Not me. I'm in my prime.
And you must be Ringo. Look, Darling, Johnny Ringo. The Deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say. What do you Think, darling? Should I hate him?
Ecentus stultorum magister.
I beg to differ. We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
That's good. I knew it wasn't nothin'.
Not exactly...
Yes, I know. You are a good woman.
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger. The Odds are all with the house.
That's what I love about Wyatt. He can talk himself into anything.
I see. And what would you do if " she " walked in her right now? WYATT " She "?
I don't know. Probably ignore her.
I'd ignore her. People can Change, Doc.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
So what does he want?
Revenge? For what?
Never got to wear one of those.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree? A better one might be how Do you feel?
I imagine it would, yes. So now We can add self pity to your list Of frailties.
You think I'm kidding. You're the Most fallible, wrong headed, self Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known. Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
When will you wake up? You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt. Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's. Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life. There's Only life, that's all. Just life. The rest is relative.
First you can grab that black Haired woman and make her your own.
Run. Take that girl and start Running. Run and don't look back. All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By. This time run and don't look Back and call it living. Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt. Live, Wyatt... Live for me.
No.
Cards in spades. I'm in love with Every second of her life. Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust.
I made a promise.
So're the Cowboys. They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us.
I know what it means.
Oh... Now she's starting. How do they know?
I have a better idea, let's run It out of them!
Fun though, wasn't it?
Wouldn't you? You're laughing! I Was sure you never laughed.
Yes, but how often? Tell me, are You happy?
You're a little touchy about it.
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored. That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Just answer.
Doesn't suit you.
Just doesn't, that's all.
Room service.
Well he's handsome and he's Charming. He's all right. For Now. Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten. I can't help it. I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live. I'm a woman, I like men. If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady. At least I'm honest.
I know, me too. What should we do About it?
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
I hate Sadie.
Always?
You feel bad about this? About me?
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me. I know Things, Wyatt. Sweet things. I Could make you so happy.
You did. Well... thank you.
Milt Joyce, owner operator.
Well sure, neighbor, easy to say.
You get lonely?
Oh, all right.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Just go. It's all right. Wyatt, Really. Work well.
Out ridin'. So... how you doin'?
Really? You sure?
Just thinkin'out loud. Forget it.
' Least you admit it.
Look, Mattie, I know you're
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother. Come back, no hard Feelings.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind? You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
You're the boss. One thing, though.
Look, I got a rule. I don't talk To lawmen. Dog catchers neither.
Well in that case, I saw your Horse. Billy Clanton was takin'Him up to the Cut to show him Off. The boys're all up there Right now, branding. And in a Mood. Still want your property Back, Mr. Private Citizen?
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
Not anymore, not after this.
We'll see about that.
Well what do you think happens When you die?
I read this book, book on Spiritualism...
Yeah?
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else. It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone. But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
What's it look like? They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin'into my hole.
I am usin'it, Wyatt. Been Wonderin'how the hell we got in This tangle. You know they hit Clum's house, too? Shot up his wife. His wife. Who ever heard of That? Men sneakin'around in the Dark, back shootin', scarin'Women? They're bugs, Wyatt. You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live? Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
Listen to yourself, Wyatt. Lie Down and crawl or you might get Hurt? What kinda talk is that? That's Virgil lyin'over there, Wyatt. Our own brother. Ruined For life. No sir, I ain't going No place. You want to go, fine. I'm stayin'right here and have It out with those bastards.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
Isn't true. I can't see a damn thing.
That a fact?
That a fact?
Well I'm real scared.
We're gonna do it, boys. Gonna Get ours. Feel it in my bones. All we have to do is keep our Eyes on that brass ring.
So to speak.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
It's got nothin'to do with you, Wyatt. It's
Business is business. Don't have To love'em to work with'em. Not If there's money in it.
You'll never make that stick.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor. You Go down there to arrest'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin'around lookin'for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
All right, Virge, your call. But Give Doc the shotgun. They'll be Less apt to get nervy if they see Him on the street howitzer.
Look at'em all. They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son. Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
None of my business, Fred.
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton. It's deadlier than uranium.
I'm on my way.
Come. Let's get out of the noise. I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success.
My third great Uncle the Earl of Aberdeen negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese. His son in law George Harmsway made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai... His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper. It was a city of unlimited possibility.
Because it's a dying city. Since the Chinese take over, who knows what can happen tomorrow? In any case, this is my father, Charles: A royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations. Said I'd never amount to anything, but... I turned it into this
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
Your choice. Look at the time! Come. There's someone I want you meet about a story I'm thinking of publishing.
Instant melt down.
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Do I have to dial'9'to get out?
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road. All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse Stop that! Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.
I thought your specialty was good bye.
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Just hold me.
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Come on. I know better than that
Gone fishing.
Big game fishing. Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA.
Perfect way to tie up a...'Knotty'problem?
Does it work on cash machines?
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device.
That's reassuring.
Let's take a look at the body.
Step into my office.
Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok. Should have seen his rose garden: Blooms the size of hand grenades.
She married a hockey player.
We work in the dark. We do what we can.
Can you arrange a meeting?
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
They point, I shoot.
Of course.
... Kids?
No.
You too.
Have we met?
Sidney Winch.
Pity. Bring him whatever he wants.
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
I'll keep that in mind.
Nice to run into you again.
No?
So charming! So suave! Don't insult me. I'm not one of your'little London girls'who falls for the lies.
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
You heard me. A gun? I left mine in the car.
Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
Blood or Dutch?
He's killed closer.
Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
We blast through.
... Yes?
And number two?
And when might that be?
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
Yes. 1988. He was furious at the British plan to return Hong Kong, and supposedly started his own negotiations with the Chinese Government. The inquiry went nowhere but it did earn MI 6 a rather powerful enemy
What do you make of all this?
A three thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air.
Indeed they are. Deadly little things.
I was just getting to the interesting part!
Remind me.
Mandarin. You jerk. I'm late. I have to get dressed.
But as I've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story. Don't you agree Mr. Bond?
No matter what the British government says, I won't kill this story. Miss Oxford will show both of you to the elevator... And one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later.
Start the grinders.
A hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island a barren, lifeless rock and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization. And now that I'm being forced to give it back, I intend to return it in exactly the same condition: A barren, lifeless rock. The gold is merely reparations payment from the spineless British government who wouldn't listen.
Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan. Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.
Kill him! Finish it!
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
What's in the box, General? What's in the box???
Abort the cruise.
Yes.
Not anymore, not in the city.
Well, you just have to move further out.
I'm not here to argue, sir.
I don't know how two brothers can be so different.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
You're always taking his side.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
Gideon, don't say things like that.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
I will appreciate that.
How is the garden doing?
How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick.
Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
I cut it on an old rusty knife.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
It's only a tale.
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time.
Only if you can spare it.
I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra and I thought you need a rest. I'll stand guard. Okra wants to talk to you anyway.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
You invited me.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
Those boys never did have good luck.
Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth.
Well, you and your husband are special. Ya, Gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones. But the problem grows.
Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't. You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you, you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. You just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste.
No, I'm a different person now, Harry.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
My mother passed on years ago.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
All the people working with us are really doing it'cause they hate to see suffering.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child. In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
In some things. When we were children, there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn't have something on you that didn't make a X.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
Country people got so many strange ways,
Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
What must I do?
When did you talk to Harry?
Where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends? They all smell of moth balls.
It is so considerate of you.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Oh, hey it was nothing.
Heh, heh... oh yeah, uh, I...
Well, let's see, we've got double A's
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
Yes, I can.
Can!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
All right, then, I will. Stand back everyone!
Oh, no, no, no... Buzz, look! An alien!
I'd better take a look anyway.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
Down there. Just down there. A helpless toy... it's... it's trapped, Buzz!
Oh. Oh, that's good.
No.
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
My fault?! If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Well, then let's climb abroad.
Hyper active hyperdrive, and astro... uh, turf.
Back! Back, you savages! Back!
Shhh!
Look at me! I can't even fly out of a window!
Why, sure you can, Buzz. You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Whoa, hey wait a minute. Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
No, it is. Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY! You are HIS toy.
Why would Andy want you?! Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear. Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you. You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that that whoosh thing you are a COOL toy.
Yes Sir!
It's ok. Everything's under control.
NO O O O O O O!!
The match!
Ha ha!! To Infinity and Beyond!!
Stay calm, everyone!!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
I dunno.
I don't know!
What?
No she's NOT
NO O O... Don't touch her! NO!
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced. This is Andy we're talking about.
Okay, save your batteries!
Yeah, hey Buzz. Let's show the guys our new secret best friends hand shake. Gimme five, man!
Okay, thank you. At ease.
Come in, Mother Bird. Alright... Andy's opening the first present now.
It's a big one... It's a... it's a boardgame! Repeat! Battleship Battleship, the boardgame!
Andy's coming, everybody! Back to your places. Hurry!
Oh... well alright, you can be red if you want.
Bad news?!
There's no law, as I know of, to prevent it.
There's not.
I like plaits.
I carried you up to your bed.
Slip up and change into a skirt, else he'll create something terrible. Don't you want to make a good impression on your first day?
Didn't you know he made things?
I can't go home because there's no home left.
What about school?
Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.
What did I do wrong?
You're only a young thing.
Living with him put years on me.
Ah, come on now!
I'm cold.
You did what?
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Finn...
Nothing... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Do you think we should take her up to bed?
Surely she is older?
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
Everything is gone, now.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
In the play. She was married, by my age. And Mummy. Mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married. Well, not that much older.
What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys. Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
I wanted my Leda to be a little girl. Leda and the swan. See?
He's not here.
No.
How much?
You will believe me, because it's true.
Listen to me carefully. First of all, Carl isn't here. DEA's got him and they'll hang on to him until arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow. So here you're wasting your time. Are you with me?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here. I want you to go home and relax the best you can. Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.
How much do I pay him?
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying. There's too much heat on Carl.
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
I'm glad you think so, but I'm picturing a debt ridden, thirty two year old mother whose ex husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar. And I'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that?
Have you gone crazy? You are not Carl. You aren't as good as Carl. They are moving the trial to a high security location. The press has gone berserk. The jury will be influenced. Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
I can't do that.
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
You had it all figured out. You move into my house. You raise my kids. You sleep with my wife. It was a good plan, Arnie.
So my wife is lying?
Goodbye Arnie.
It's so frustrating.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit. School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly. Christ, this could be embarrassing.
Stop. You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
This is different.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years old.
Space for what? To O. D. like that other kid? I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents. Because it isn't. Correct?
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me. As a parent.
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
No, I don't think so. Leave me alone, give me money. That's what I get from our daughter. She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
Oh, it is?
God, I don't get it. Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child? Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
At least she's alive.
Sorry, but I mean, come on.
Are you going to?
Is this bad for him?
He's a friend. He's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation. He'd definitely had a few beers, but it's not like he wanted to drive. We didn't know what else to do. It wasn't my pot.
What's up?
I got that. How was your day?
Helena
Helena
Fine legalization. Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today. The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions. The U. S. becomes a giant pharmacy. Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion.
I don't know.
It's a presidential appointment so... until I quit or get fired.
Oh, yes I can.
Not like. It is.
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Yes, mom
Why? Nobody's there.
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
She knows Arnie Metzger.
You want to make a wager on this?
He won. He was a winner. That bothers you.
Yeah, like turning into a beautiful woman.
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
Arizona.
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
Especially Tiger Woods.... Actually, he keeps his on the back seat.
You may speak.
I don't really like guns. You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
I don't know. Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl. The security is very tight. There may not be a way.
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
We can protect you.
In Mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity, this is not so true for the USA. Using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search. The odds are not high, and we found variables that reduce the odds. We hire drivers with nothing to lose. Then we throw a lot of product at the problem. Some get stopped. Enough get through. It's not difficult.
He hired you. That was a mistake.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are. This food tastes like shit.
You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana. You're helping them. You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.
We aren't barbarians.
Bring this man a change of good clothes. Has he eaten?
You will dine with me from now on.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
I don't think you're going to do that.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
Not in...
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I must first ask you to pass a test. I asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors.
Exactly, and this is how I know I'm not getting into business with the U. S. Government.
What's he doing up here?
Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see them again. Everything's back to normal.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban
Yeah. It should be fun. You wanna come?
No, but a lot of other people. You should come. You should come out with us.
Porfirio Madrigal is not dead. I just saw him.
A place we have, that we know is protected.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
This is a very different proposition.
Well, Javier Rodriguez, you've done a very good job, but we'll take care of it from here.
What is the name of your informant?
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
A small thing. Nothing really.
He'll do what I say.
When he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here. He will freely give the names of his superiors. Then we get them and they too will give us names. And eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will fall.
So what's it doing in Tijuana?
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
The worst serial killer in history who? Gacy right? Killed forty two people. Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U. S. Government. So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them. I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor trailers. At least a half dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
We ask questions and measure the answers. When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look. Before NAFTA we had about 1. 9 million trucks a year. Now it's almost double. Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
Sure. More money in intelligence on their side of the border. So we have a better idea who we're looking for. More dogs. More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x ray machines to run the trucks through. Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do. But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now. In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars. What does that tell you?
Right. But, that's not the biggest problem. One of our Intel officers picked up information from DEA that traffickers have come up with a process, a chemical process, to turn coke into something else. It doesn't smell like coke. It doesn't look like coke. And what's worse, it doesn't react to field test. It could be anything. Maybe it's already happening. I mean, how would we know?
I need to find my daughter. I'll pay you.
I got money.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
Oh, man
I tried to talk to her when she was up there, but they wouldn't put me through. I'm surprised she hasn't called.
I'm not the police. I don't care about experimentation. She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
I don't give a fuck about your parents
What?
You don't know what the hell you're talking about. You're a cocky seventeen year old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away. And neither does she.
Hey man, back the fuck up. To this place. What's that shit? Right now, all over this country, a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see, You got any drugs? You know where I can get drugs? What kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person, on their possibilities? If you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood, Indian Hills, and they asked every white person they saw, hey, you got any drugs?, within a day, your friends and their kids would be selling. It's market forces, man. The product's marked up three hundred percent. You can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day. You think white people would still be going to law school?
That would be very helpful to me. Also, I received the offer from DEA and the FBI to train some of my men at Quantico. I think this will be extremely useful, a good way for us to absorb some of your methods.
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand? What is your policy for treating addiction?
I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self defeating. Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.
Apparently not. Look, it's a shit storm here right now. When are you coming back? I don't know what to tell people any more.
If we're moving the press conference, we need to do it now. Are you all right?
He's a research doctor. You're dad's a doctor, too
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon
Well, I've not brought them.
Well, I've not brought them.
I'm sorry.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
Christ.
No, I don't mean like that I mean something nice, like, that's all
You were in my way.
Ninteen.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.
I'm a fugitive from the law. I can't be seen on the fucking streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Two thirty. Five pounds to win. Bad Boy.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty three pounds.
I guess you would, Franco.
What's your name?
Where are you going, Diane?
Where's that?
Great.
I'll come back if you like, but I'm not promising anything.
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Sorry.
What?
Come on.
Jesus.
Holding hands?
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Can I see you again?
Yes.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
No.
Well, it isn't.
You're too young.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
The point is, you've got to find something new.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
What? Steady like?
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Happy birthday.
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
What happened?
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
I didn't either. What the fuck is it?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
Returned it? Where? To the video shop, Tommy? To the fucking video store? So every punter in Edinburgh is jerking off to our video? God, Tommy, I feel sick.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Do you recall the school motto?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
Hey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man. You're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. I'm merely here. But obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it?
There's no need.
No problem for me either. Honestly, it's no problem.
Spud, they're my sheets.
Following the game at all?
No. Me Neither.
Clear?
That's nice.
Have you got any gear on you?
Well, sub us, then, mate. I'm expecting a rent cheque.
Now remember
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS,'This cunt's no trying'and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
But try too hard
Exactly.
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
Try this.
Would not say no, would not say no.
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
The only drawback, or at least the principal drawback, is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that
Running time?
Director?
Screenwriter?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
You can look it up.
You don't know, do you?
The park?
Who wrote it?
Roald Dahl. Fuck me.
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley.
I don't rate that at all.
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
Yeah.
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Say something, Mark, say something
Did he you know?
You know.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
God, you're sick.
Cut it out.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking,'I should be coining it here.'Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, no hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm getting on with life. What are you doing?
It was my fucking television.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
How much?
So?
So we've just come from Tommy's funeral and you're telling me about a skag deal?
But you don't have the money?
That's tough.
Sorry, boys, I don't have two thousand pounds.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
The Sick Boy method.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
That's hardly a substitute.
No, I don't think so.
Excellent.
Why, thank you.
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
Sure.
Sounds great, Swanney.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?
It's fresh air.
Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?
How long is it?
Six weeks!
Where did she come up with that?
Six weeks and no sex?
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge.'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide. '
Well, I've paid for the ticket.
A walk.
Homeless people?
Mr. Murphy,  leaving your friend aside,  do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
It was not. The Barrier stood between us but we breached it.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
With a starship!
It could. Yes.
It will be your chariot!
The ship....
It runs deep. Share it with me.
Return to prearranged coordinates for pickup.
Don't worry, fellas. Your secret's  safe with me. I'll send the shuttlecraft to pick you up.
New course? You have no authority. What's going on here?
Closing.
But the shuttle
Let us explore it together.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
What is it you seek?
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
But how?
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
ER... You forgot to take it with you.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Transporter room. Status.
And that is?
Ah, Captain?
I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
I've always known... I'll die alone.
The lyrics are are very simple. It's, er, " Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.. " The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in. Doctor, if you please.
Jim.
Life is not a dream.
Yes, Captain.
General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.
But he does seem familiar?
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
He believed the key to self knowledge was emotion, not logic.
To land any closer would risk detection.
Be one with the horse.
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
I ordered you to defend this ship.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
There, you see? See?
I gotta sit down.
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
How do you know?
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
I am here, Captain.
" a "... " n "... uh, " d "... end of word.
Uh uh.
Fire the rockets!
To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.
Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.
But I thought Captain Chekov.. I see. Very clever, Captain. Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say?
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear. Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
I don't control minds. I free them.
No. I refuse.
Your vision?
You are mad!
No special conditions?
What makes you think I won't turn us around?
Spock...



I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
Scotty, dear, he'not a madman.
No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.
I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.
You know I'm right.
I know you better than that.
Why not?
I don't understand...
Sybok, we must find a way...
Are you embezzling?
I don't get it.
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of'em. I was this close to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has " invented " the slime didn't even change the names and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to... what is he now, Executive V. P.?
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Because somewhere... in one of those memories... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
Want one?
Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods...
Did he say why?
Flynn had Group 7 access.
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
I want to go to his place.
I mean I want both of us to go.
Of what?
What?
Boy, I sit up there grindin'away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
Yes... but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
They'll start to soon enough.
Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding... great piece of work. How's it going?
Yeah...?
I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime. I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Ok
Oh. Anything else?
Only yes and no... You're a bit.
Where's your program? Won't it miss you?
Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate?
Flynn?
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
Meanwhile, he might find it.
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
Cute.
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now... this is what I get for using humans.
I've gotten 2, 415 times smarter since then.
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right
User requests are what computers are for.
Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.
Hmm. A difficult proposition... difficult proposition at best. Perhaps you've noticed... we're not exactly packing them in these days...
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Well, isn't it?
I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...?
You're alive!
It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a well, I'm what you guys call a User.
Then...
Well that's how it is for programs, yes, but
Stranger and stranger...
Not us, I hope.
Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
What's wrong with that area?
Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments...
Jump.
You're a... " guest " of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
Yeah, yeah that's great.
Oh, uh... I don't remember too much...
Well... my home " sector " was called Paramus...
It grows on you.
Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us
Good luck. You can't even think in here.
Whew. You never were much for small talk. She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
You've got it. I've been hopin'you'd send me somebody with a little moxie... what kind of program is he?
But what if I can't...?
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
I don't have time, Sark. And neither do you. End of line.
The Users... you really think they're still there?
How?
It's a flat. But wait a micro...
We have to get off this beam!
Where's Flynn?
Are you kidding? Harry had to go out of town.
Yeah. You know Harry.
Harry only has two moods: busy...  and asleep.
Will you shutup. I should never have told you about him.
No you're not. You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
Out.
I have a book report.
You seem fine now.
I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady. You never used to lie to me. But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
You know you can always talk to me. Right? Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Unbelievable! Trent told me he wrote it. He's history.
Uh huh. Right here in river city.
She lives in Rome, but she does stuff here the Smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices  here. 
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Probably because it sounds scary. 
Got it. Nice touch. Okay, pick me up at eight. The de brief is at ten hundred.
Yeah, but you're not her parents, anymore, you and Helen. Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. The five minutes you spend a day with her can't compete with that kind of constant bombardment. You're outgunned, amigo.
Fourteen, Harry.
Well... I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement. Don't change the subject... you owe me two hundred bucks.
Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy?
Just hang a minute.
She's having an affair.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Same thing happened to me with wife two. I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty. I mean empty. She even took the ice cube trays from the fridge. What kind of person would think of that?
Relax. Helen still loves you. She just wants this guy to bang her. It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it after a
What're you talking about? We have that.
He could be working her to get to you.
It skips from page nine to eleven. Where's page ten?
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
Whatya talking? I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe. Clean as a
You know about that?
Oh shit. Harry... what're you doing?
You're welcome.
I don't know. I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
So, it was your first time.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
God! You have no idea how much that turns me on. I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
I adore it.
Especially in this light. This is the only light they had then,  so I like to study it this way. I love this place. I love all ruins.
Uh, yes, it is important.
Not exactly.
Sure. Say that now.
Okay.
What did you tell him?
Good thinking, honey.
Baby, I said I'd be there. Really. Trust me. Gotta go, honey. Bye bye.
I couldn't believe it. I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it
Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server...
Uh huh.
They said you had to run out.
Not because you were attracted to him?
You weren't attracted to him at all?
Would you say he was boring, then?
And you agreed?
Why?
I needed to feel alive. I wanted to do something... outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed. To be trusted. To be special.
Yes.
I love him. I have always loved him and I will always love him. Can I go home, please?
What do you think? Of course yes! What's involved?
My husband can't know about this.
I think so.
I can do it!
Natasha?
Harry, be quiet. Let me handle this.
Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Then where did I get this?
It makes you tell the truth?
Is it working yet?
Are we going to die?
I don't take those assignments.
She's really a fox, isn't she?
No. But I wanted to.
Looks that way.
Harry... snap out of it!
Do you still love me?
As much as you used to?
It's killer. Look at me I'm not that much to look at. No really. I can be honest. But I got'em lining up, and not just skanks, either. Some are.
Sorry. Trade secret.
Well, think of it as playing a role. It's fantasy. You have to work on their dreams. Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
Doesn't matter. I like change. You know, constant turnover. As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
Exactly. The trick is, you gotta pick your target. They have to be nice little housewife types. School teachers. But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck start a leaf blower.
Dickless. If they took care of  business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
Wait! You got the wrong guy. My name's Simon. Look, just let me go. There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your
Of course. Mrs. Tasker. And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal? Taking dictation?
Uh... well, okay then. You sound terrible. I'll run out right now. Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy. Sure, no problem. Bye.
So now it's Tasker? Not Renquist?
No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years
Hold that thought.
Yes. Go ahead.
Okay. It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now. If I get a signal... I may have to leave suddenly.
It's my job to risk my life, but not yours. I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust.
Worse than Cairo? 
Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation. See two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running  shootout, ending at the  Marriot...
You can trust me completely.
Right, of course. I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
And you chased one?
You'll call me then?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married. They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you. Can you get away? Just for two days.
Here. Sit down. Be comfortable.
Relax. There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.
You can call me Simon. You're very brave to do this... You opened it.
No. He checked out okay
How?
His wife? Good. Bring them.
I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.
What letter?
Yes.
I didn't get any chicken.
It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.
Oh, hush up.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You could have been a real dick.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin'all the cops'asses. Now, while keepin'them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops'asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Thanks a lot.
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
Sonny kicks ass.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
' Bout twelve.
No. Not particularly. How come?
I love to get pie after a movie.
I'd love some pie.
Tell me about yourself.
C'mon. What're ya tryin'to be? The Phantom Lady?
Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn ons and turn offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin'a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
I don't remember.
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
Burt Reynolds.
Yes, I would.
What kinda music do you like?
What are your turn ons?
Turn offs?
Do you have a fella?
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin'that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.
How long have you worked here?
That's a long time.
Do you get paid a lot?
You bet. How much is that worth?
Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. " Man from U. N. C. L. E. " Lunch boxes. " Green Hornet " board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here.
Uh huh, I was tryin'to think of somethin'to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
She OD'd, didn't she?
You mean she got a bad batch?
So he really loved her?
Did you hurt yourself? Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin'the place off.
" Heroes For Sale "?
Who?
That dazzling imagination.
Who and what is a Drexl?
You have a pimp?
A real live pimp?
Is he black?
Is he nice?
What did he do to Arlene?
This motherfucker sounds charming!
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
Will you be my wife?
You better not be fucking teasing me.
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One Armed Boxer.
Top o'the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
Write down Drexl's address.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.
Is this a joke?
I think what you did...
... was so romantic.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin'arms.
With a vengeance, I hated them.
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin'to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin'about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin'to pay my rent every month, an'here I was livin'next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin'planes take off drownin'out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin'people doin'what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
Leavin'Detroit. Goin'off on vacations, startin'new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
Why Cancoon?
But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin'his ass off.
Naw naw!
Live with what?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can't believe what you're tellin'me.
You'd really do that?
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin'me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
If I thought I could get away with it
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin'coffee.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: " I'll take that gun ", " You'll have to ".
You don't think I'm kissin'his ass, do you?
I'm not lyin'to him. I mean it. I loved " Coming Home in a Body Bag ".
Who the fuck are you?
Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.
No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin'down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin'from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, " This motherfucker's carryin'on like he ain't got a care in the world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV. " See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin'out, and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin'at me. Now, I know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.
It's great to hear from you.
You comin'to L. A.? When?
What's up? Why're leavin'Detroit?
I'm a married man.
Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it. Wanna say hi to my better half?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin'out with girls from my acting class.
What's so fuckin'good about it? Actresses are the most fucked in the head bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a really good reading for " T. J. Hooker " the other day.
You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
Do you have any idea how much fuckin'coke you got?
I don't know! A fuckin'lot!
Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
Is he big league?
What'd'ya tell'em?
What's this acting class guy's name?
Elliot what?
OK, call'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
The zoo.
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin'it off like it don't mean shit.
Um, nothing, let's go?
In case of what?
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
How'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
A Donny Chiba triple feature. " The Streetfighter ", " Return of the Streetfighter ", and " Sister Streetfighter ".
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
Three kung fu movies.
Yeah, OK.
Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin'wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin'business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
What do you think, eightball?
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin'stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin'and you didn't hear nothin'.
No. No, you don't.
Get on your knees.
Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.
No. Not yet.
That good, huh?
Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you " Coming Home in a Body Bag " is one of my favorite movies. After " Apocalypse Now " I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. " Sophie's Choice ", " Ordinary People ", " Kramer vs. Kramer ", " Gandhi ". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee table dog shit.
Like that Merchant Ivory clap trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
Me too, Boris.
Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
Why does he trust you?
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
I can, but I don't.
Get a six pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin'starvin'to death. Are you hungry too?
I really don't know.
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk
Daddy, I'm in big fuckin'trouble and I really need your help.
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
What makes you think I could do that?
What makes you think I would do that?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
Keep it.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
I'm the Anti Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how full of shit I am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine. Want a Chesterfield?
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
What are you talkin'about?
I don't believe you.
On their honeymoon.
They didn't tell me.
You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers.
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break in on Riverdale.
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin'up Who's case is it?
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
You and Robin moved?
That was a good fuckin'movie.
Do you believe him?
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
But a fuckin'baggie.
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin'games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time
Or a bit player
You're a fuckin'star! And you're gonna be playin'your little one man show nightly for the next two fuckin'years for a captive audience
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
He produced " Coming Home in a Body Bag ".
So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke.
Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.
He saw the wire.
He knows something's up.
You ain't seen nothin'like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.
Shit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a nigger's crib, an'get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.
Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin'everybody's stray clothes there lately.
That's bullshit.
Then, after a while sisters use to gettin'their little pussy eat. And because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere.
I tell Jayne Kennedy, " Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass! "
With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.
Just put it in your purse.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
Put it in your pants.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Do you live here?
Sorta room mates?
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin'here?
How do you know? You been there?
You're right. It is.
No.
Yes.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Well, you go down Beechwood...
Then where the hell do you get off talkin'that kind of talk?
Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin'what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand up guy.
She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing.... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
I got into trouble. I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen a spider but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it. It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.
I'm going to be completely honest. I'm not going to lie to you. I can't make the police let you go... but I do want to help you. And I want you to trust me. Can you do that, James? May I call you " James "?
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
What kind of information?
Change what?
Do you know why you're here, James.
I see. You don't remember assaulting a police officer... several officers?
You don't have a driver's license, James? Or a Social Security card?
Why not? Most people have some ID.
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James? A hospital?
A jail? Prison?
Hiding?
What's wonderful about the air, James?
You're afraid of germs?
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
July.
Do you know what year it is?
What year do you think it is?
You think it's July of 1995? That's the future, James. Do you think you're living in the future?
1995 is the future, James. This is 1989.
No. That's the reason they chose me I remember things.
I have the... strangest feeling I've met you before... a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
I have to do this, James. You're very confused.
Yes, I remember. Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
Everybody's got a gun. In this city...
My father told me that. " Never cry wolf. " Then people won't believe you if... something really happens.
Something bad. Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff...
About an airport... before everything happened. It's the same dream I always have the only one. I'm a little kid in it.
You were very upset. You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
A secret army. The Army of The Twelve Monkeys. I've told you about them. They spread the virus. That's why we have to get to Philadelphia. I have to find them it's my assignment.
I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates. So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure. So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth.
What do you mean when you were a kid?
The man... with the voice. I recognized him. He's from the present. He...
Lock it now!
I said I was too young to drive. I didn't say I was stupid.
I got shot. Look there's a gas station up ahead.
It was some kind of... war. Never mind, you wouldn't believe me. Turn off here.
That has your name on it. Give him cash.
See you can drive after all!
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race. Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else. You've created something in your mind, James a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
It can be dealt with, but only if you want to. I can help you.
It would be great if I'm crazy. If I'm wrong about everything... the world will be okay. I'll never have to live underground.
The gun!... I lost it
No gun! Stars! Air! I can live here. Breathe!
You mean, treat me? Cure me? Kathryn, those words on the wall I've seen them before... I... I... dreamed them.
Just like that? You were in prison?
You disappeared! One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
The boy in the well. How did you know that was just a hoax?
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
IT WASN'T A TV SHOW! IT WAS REAL!
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James! How did it get there?
Well, I can't.... I mean... I'm trying to. I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die... soon.
No superiors! No scientists. No people from the future. It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company. They have voice mail you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
I couldn't resist. I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them... they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part. Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past. The movie never changes it can't change but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different you notice different things.
Flowers! What flowers?
I mean in my dream I didn't realize it was you. Then... I woke up and I... I thought you were gone.
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace... but not to Key West!
I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
A telephone call? That's communication with the outside world! Doctor's discretion. Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread. Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them! Whackos everywhere! A plague of madness. In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill. I'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all I know you're crazy as a loon. But that's not why you're here. Why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy. There's the TV. It's all right there. Commercials. We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated. What are we for then? We're consumers. Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what? You're mentally ill! That's a fact! If you don't buy things... toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices... SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT IN RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right? That's very sane. I can help you. You want me to, don't you? Get you out?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?'Cause I'd be crazy to escape! I'm all taken care of, see? I've sent out word.
I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you... properly. LIKE A GUEST! LIKE A PERSON! SHEETS! TOWELS! LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...
What are you talking about???
A lawsuit? You going to sue them?
What...???
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles. See, he definitely doesn't know me. Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
We need to talk. Come on. Upstairs. I am a new person! I'm completely adjusted. Witness the tux. It's Armani. Who chattered? Goines? Weller?
Plan? What are you talking about?
Bulishit! You're fucking with my head!
Listen, you dumb fuck! The thing mutates We live underground! The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats. We're like moles or worms. All we want to do is study the original...
The phone call, man. The phone call.
Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago! Yes, that phone call. I been in training for this a couple a months now ever since I got back from that... " weird " war we were in. You remember that? Here, take it, man! You could still be a hero if you'd cooperate!
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
Who am I supposed to shoot?
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
You " develop " viruses and you're calling me insane? Typical. What does this virus attack? Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter. Have I ever " developed " a virus? Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements? Wow! And I'm crazy!
THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT! YOU'RE OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY. GOT THAT? NOW WHAT FUCKING VIRUS HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED FUCKING MANIAC?
No! Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
Ex psychiatrist! Now, what about flashlights? How many flashlights...?
Negative for drugs. But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs. No drugs. You believe that?
Yes, please. You said he gave a name...
No, thank you.
Don't call me old man. Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Yeah I want something. I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind. Can't you see that?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on? Sunnin'myself?
I ain't got no eyes. You want to see?
Lost my eyes on Okinawa. Lost them fighting the war. Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
Don't be sorry. Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Change? You want my change? I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
He no!
That a fact?
Maybe I do.
I think I've heard that before.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
I won't hold my breath.
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
You afraid of the dark?
You don't fear death?
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride. Is that it?
Not this twig, friend. I got plans.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either. I don't guess I'll be seeing you again. Take it easy.
Nothing.
I'll bet my watch against your pay.
Next city you're in take it to a jeweler. He won't give you less than four hundred for it.
I'm a rich man off of thirty bucks?
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
A coin's got two sides. When you flip it there's a fifty fifty chance it'll be heads or tails. Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
No it won't. You just don't know shit about statistics.
Put your money where your chicken lipped mouth is. I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right.
Where to?
But, in particular?
Where in Mexico would you like
One way, or round trip?
Thirty even.
I bought a beer. That was two fifty. I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
Yeah. Just a little short. Figures. I just wanted to get out, that's all.
Nope. Darrell.
He's up at the Look Out.
You own this place?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
But he's dead.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Somewhere else? Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here. How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
How much time?
What time is it now?
Jesus. Twenty after ten and it must be ninety already.
Yeah, right. Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Nothing.
Just banged my head. It was an accident.
How much?
How much!?
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari. You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
It might as well be fifteen hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Listen, man. I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had.
Now that's too bad. I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
Sweet talk me all you want, I still want my hundred forty five dollars.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin'in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin'to get than when you started?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin'dog. Ain't much you can do when you feel like that'cept tough it out.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
No charge.
Two hundred.
It's going to cost you two hundred dollars.
Yep. For the hose. But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein'a mechanic, don't you? I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket. Then you get in an accident and get killed. Or worse. Who they gonna blame then? They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Is that an insult? Are you insulting me.
Take it. As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket. You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
You listen to me, you fancy city man. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it. And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on her. Now get out of here! You're stinking up my garage.
Please, just leave the car alone.
We're closed. Come back in the morning.
Come back when the sun comes up.
You got the money?
I don't want no dirty money. I run an honest business.
What would a truck stop be without beer?
We ain't got no Beck's.
No, we ain't got no Kirin. We got Miller.
No. We got Miller. Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
It'd serve you right. Jose, run get a mop and clean this mess up.
Taking a little trip?
Is that right? Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit. I know I've had my fill of this town. Sixteen years I've been the law and order here. So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place. Help people, I guess. Keep the peace. Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me. Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them. Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal. I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna? A murder?
Same thing you want. I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please. But that takes money.
Can't I? You're out in the desert, all alone, with a body in your trunk. What do you think, boy?
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number. But then you make friends so easily. Don't you, Grace?
You never said anything. About the drapes.
You haven't even looked at them once.
Uh huh
How could I? I was sleeping.
I don't hear anything. You were dreaming. Or maybe the wind blew something over.
When did you buy a gun?
Jake. No. No!
That's right on my way.
Do you have to call me that?
Maybe I don't want you to.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
It's Grace.
I got it.
Accident.
That's all right. I got it.
That a fact?
Yes, I have.
I... can't... argue...
You're not from around here, are you?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Drove into Sierra? What for?
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back. Maybe they never would have found you. Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
Least you can leave.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
You've been around.
Where you headed?
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work. You must like taking chances.
What happens if you lose?
Somewhere else. I've never been anywhere else. Just once. Years ago. Went to the state fair. It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
I didn't say it bothered me.
I guess. I've got an ego same as any man.
What do you do anyway?
Where'd you learn to do that?
A medicine man?
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
The same thing you do.
Lift me down.
Beautiful?
I like them. I was sick of looking at this room. I think they add a little life.
Such as?
You flirt with me, then you run cold. You lead me on, then slap me down. I don't go for being jerked around.
I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys. But you already know that. You read my fortune. Thanks for the lemonade.
That's not an answer. What is it you want?
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
You love him?
Did you ever?
I'm guessing no.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I don't know how.
It's not that easy. Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please. I can't. I don't want to be alone. I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Is that so bad? It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy. For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would... do things for him. I guess I'm no good that way. I guess I tried to sucker you along like that. Do you hate me for it? I wouldn't blame you if you did. But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Have you ever been there before?
Is it pretty?
Take me with you.
Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one hundred fifty dollars.
Jake.
He doesn't give it to us. We take it.
He's got money. In a floor safe in the living room. I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time. More like brags. He loves his money. Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred thousand.
Lied? What do you mean?
It's not a combination lock. It takes a key. He keeps it on him all the time. I mean all the time. It scratches up against me when we do it.
We'd have to kill him.
John, please
What are you talking about?
Is it so bad? It would be quick. He wouldn't even have to feel it.
Jesus Christ! Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace. I can't do it.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
There is no us, remember?
I've thought about you every second since I left. I can still taste you on my lips.
Why? Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I mean it, Grace. I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I could if I had Jake's money.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole. There's only one way to do that.
I came back for you; this morning I came back. Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls.
You don't know? Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
Oh, that's great. We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
There isn't! There's nothing under here but more floor. Jesus fucking Christ! We killed a man for nothing but floor.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
Don't yell at me! I know it's here! I know it!
Let him watch. I want him to know what he's missing.
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
To get my car.
Put some clothes on him. When I get back We'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert. It'll takes days for anybody to find him.
I got the money all packed. I put the jeep in the garage. Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away. Might buy us some time.
Had push it in. Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
No, you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut so I could go to a hanging alone.
It doesn't matter. He was there and he let it happen. He can't take us in.
What?
He can't prove anything, John. He can't turn us in.
He was going to take the money.
It's our money. He had no right to take it.
I know. He was to take the fucking money.
You killed a man for no reason!
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
Are you kidding? I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
We killed Jake. And it's a big difference. You kill an old man, that's one thing. Nobody cares about an old man. You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
The police don't know that. And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck. I'll take you as far as California. If we can even make that. After that I'm cutting you loose.
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again? You take your hald of the money and run. You might want to try Mexico. With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
I think you're a lying, back stabbing bitch. But it's nice to know you care.
Can you climb back up.
Grace, listen to me. In the trunk of my car is a rope. It should reach down here. Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
The trunk. It's locked.
It's... it's locked.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
No. I swear it.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Someone will find me.
You idiot! You'll kill us both!
For Christ's sake, John! Throw me the keys!
Fuck you! Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you! John... John!?
Husband...?
I.. I was helping your wife. I met her in town. She needed a hand with her drapes. That's all.
I swear to you that's all that happened. I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
Grace, tell him.
You've got to be
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
I'm a solid man.
What brings you to Sierra?
Where you headed?
Live there?
You a sailor man? That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that. Just sail away until all he was was a memory. I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it? Not a wit. Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were. I can tell you got a temper on you.
Would you kill her?
This is a joke, right? You just want to rattle me. Right?
Another accident? You've really got to be more careful. Can I get you a drink?
Hungry?
I'm surprised to see you. I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
Isn't that illegal?
Talk? About what?
Sweet Grace? What about her?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
I'm not rambling.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Bullshit. You wanted me to kill her.
You meant it.
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.
And for that you'd kill Grace?
Just to get out of here? That doesn't seem much for a murder.
I put it at fifty thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course. Which is?
Twenty thousand? I don't have that kind of money. I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead. I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise. Twenty thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
Maybe... ten thousand. And that's a maybe.
That's a bit much.
Don't say that. I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead. Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife...?
What should I do?
You want to do this yourself? I don't have to do this, you know.
No.
The time wasn't right.
You know what I mean.
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
You love her, but you hate her?
Shut up.
Drop it, Jake.
SHUT UP!
You think that's a lot of money?
That's what I like about you, Jake. You're an honest man.
You could say. I don't even have it yet.
He did more work on the car. He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
It's not like that.
Wait a minute. Just listen to me
Jake
That's not the reason I'm here. I swear it.
I came for Grace.
I came to kill her.
It's the truth, Jake.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl. Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me. Same way Grace played us this morning. I don't like that, Jake. Not twice in one day. And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
Damn it, Jake. If I don't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me. And if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace. You were going to give me thirteen thousand. Give me two hundred. I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. But I need the money. I've got to have the money.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom. Now you make straight for it.
Don't Jake me, boy! It's a big house. Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before. Maybe with Grace to keep you company.
Then maybe this afternoon. When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Is that what happened? Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
Sense? If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you? Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man. Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it. A man's got to protect his home. His wife. You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
You're right. I don't give a damn about her. But to fuck a man's wife behind his back? That just makes a fool out of him. I don't like being made a fool of.
Not from where I stand.
What are you babbling about?
Two hundred dollars.
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table. Now, I'm not going to ask you again, Mister. What were you doing with my girl?
I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
Got any requests?
How about I pick one out for you?
Gee, that's sad. Don't that make you sad?
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
You ain't from Oz. Oz is in that one movie.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
But you was going to fight for me.
He's not my boyfriend. I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for. Not yet that is.
That's what I thought until you came riding in. I saw your car over at the gas station. It's cool. Want to take me for a ride? Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Eighteen. Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
What's your name anyway?
Make time? Is everybody in this town slap happy?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
What? You want to fight? Over her?
They're not very imaginative?
Fine. I was making time with your girl. Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again. Now go away.
Christ, I don't believe this.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended. I'm beating you up.
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
Mexico? You're going to Mexico?
This means something to you? Jenny means something to me.
Let me guess. This robber; he gets your money.
The old lady?
You're the gambler. You tell me.
A hundred and... Now you listen to me you deadbeat, little punk: I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller. You owe me thirteen thousand dollars and I want it. I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
And John, don't make me come look for you.
He is at that. No so much a fault of his own. Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
His father worked in a strip mine north of here. Toby's school class went up to the mine one day. School takes field trips up there every year. Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground. Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
Yep. Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
Like I said; you really can't blame the boy. Some people don't know how to avoid trouble. Know what I mean?
Just curious. That's a nasty cut you've got.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
That's too bad. I was hoping you were there. Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away. Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Stay as long as you like, son. No rush.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra. What with that ruckus you had with Toby. Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Just cool down, son. I ain't accusing you of anything. Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
Nope. No problems up the road.
Just step from the car. Nice and slow.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
And as soon as I see that you're on your way.
I didn't do anything.
You ain't passing these test, son. If I can't trust you I'm gonna have to arrest you...
Soda. You got any soda?
Soda. You know.
No police! Wait until I'm gone.
No police!
Don't call me old man. Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Yeah I want something. I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind. Can't you see that?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on? Sunnin'myself?
I ain't got no eyes. You want to see?
Lost my eyes in Vyee et nam. Lost them fighting the commies. Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin'the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
Don't be sorry. Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Change? You want my change? I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Hell no!
That a fact?
I think I've heard that before.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
What?
All them miners last century. Hungry ghosts, killed off all the Indians. Up at the mine. Earth ran red with blood, think I'm fooling around here. White sky was on fire. Grown men cried like babies. I saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. They put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I cursed them. White people can't seem to stay away from Indians. You gotta watch where ya put your fingers. Pussy pussy pussy, Indian pussy.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
I got things to do.
Your lies are old, but you tell'em well.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin'and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin'high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Afraid of it? Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death. It's all the same to me.
More or less.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
Make time? Is everybody in this town on drugs?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
What? You want to fight? Over her?
Fine. I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Christ, I don't believe this!
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
Mexico? You going to Mexico?
This means something to you? Jenny means something to me.
I'm her husband.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
A lot that means.
It ain't broke.
Say, what happened to your hand?
You've got to be
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
I'm a solid man.
" Bobby Cooper. " What brings you to Superior, Coop?
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
Got work. I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
I hope so. Listen, McKenna about your wife: If I had known she was married
Wait a second
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were. I can tell you got a temper on you.
Would you kill her?
This is a joke, right? You just want to rattle me. Right?
Talk? About what?
Sweet Grace? What about her?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
I'm not rambling.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Bullshit. You wanted me to kill her.
You meant it.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you... You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself... well, you're not the sharing kind.
No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little " games " she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy... How much you want?
I need thirteen.
We're not talking about buying a car Jake. We're talking about killing your wife. It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
Don't say that. I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead... Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract.
How the hell should I know? I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! You want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
Be quiet, boy. I got to figure this thing. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be...
And tell her what?
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
... And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper... and then maybe borrow  200 or  20, 000, or  200, 000...
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
Two hundred dollars?
I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
Got any requests?
How about I pick one out for you?
Gee, that's sad. Don't that make you sad?
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
You ain't from Oz. Oz is in that movie.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
But you was going to fight for me.
He's not my boyfriend. I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for. Not yet that is.
That's what I thought until you came riding in. I saw your car over at the gas station. It's a cool car. Want to take me for a ride? Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
What's your name anyway?
Harlin around?
You own this place?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
But he's dead.
OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose. It's busted.
I know it's busted. What did I just tell you?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time. Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Okay, I'm stuck. You happy? Now can you fix it, or not?
Great!
How much time?
Ninety two. Course half hour from now might be seventy two. These clouds move around a lot.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Nothing.
Just banged my head. It was an accident.
Hundred fifty.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty four and a half Mustang. You know how long it took me to find that hose?
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy. What you expect but fancy damn prices?
" That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty four and a half Mustang. "
I don't know, but " it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through. " Now you owe me a hundred fifty dollars.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Now that's too bad. I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want. Didn't you read the sign? It says...
I want my hundred and forty five dollars.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin'in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin'to get than when you started?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin'dog. Ain't much you can do when you feel like that'cept tough it out.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
No charge.
Two hundred.
It's going to cost you two hundred dollars.
Yep. For the hose. But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein'a mechanic, don't you? Didn't you read the sign.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work? What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket. Then you get in an accident and get killed. Or worse. Who they gonna blame then? They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Is that an insult? Are you insulting me.
Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it. And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here'fore I call the Sheriff, who knows me.
Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just have to get something out of the trunk.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
We're closed. Come back when the sun comes up.
You got the money?
I don't want no dirty money. I run an honest business.
Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
Soda. You got any soda?
Soda. You know.
That's right on my way.
My name is Bobby. Now I'm not a stranger anymore. See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
I don't know your real name.
I like that about me, beautiful.
May I carry your package, Grace?
I got it.
Accident.
That's all right. I got it.
You're not from around here, are you?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Drove into Superior? What for?
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert. Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
You've been around.
Where you headed?
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby no direction, no steady work. You must like taking chances.
What happens when you lose?
I didn't say it bothered me.
I guess. I've got an ego same as any man.
What do you do anyway?
Where'd you learn to do that?
A medicine man?
Nice house for a shaman's daughter. You must be good.
The same thing you do.
Lift me down.
Beautiful?
And what would that be?
I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys. But you already know that. You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.
That's not an answer. What is it you want?
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
You love him?
Did you ever?
Is that why you're with him?
I'm guessing no.
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I don't know how.
It's not that easy. Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please. I can't. I don't want to be alone. I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Is that so bad? It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy. For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would... do things for him. I guess I'm no good that way. I guess I tried to sucker you along like that. Do you hate me for it? I wouldn't blame you if you did. But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Don't feel like nothing.
You'd never understand.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right? Have you ever been to California?
Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Darrell? You know he and Jake are...
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin'anywhere...
What do you mean?
One hundred thousand!? That son of a bitch.
Kill him.
What about us?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
Why? Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I mean it, Grace. I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I could if I had Jake's money.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole. There's only one way to do that.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
I got the money all packed. I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away. Buy us some time... I know a back road we can take.
I'm not coming back.
I don't know about that?
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
I'm not sailing his boat.
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
You already have.
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
He was a scumbag!... He wanted me, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're dead... You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else. Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now? How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?
I think you're a lying, back stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...
Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three...
I busted my leg!
Grace in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
Get in.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
Out of here.
I... Mexico. You got a bus that goes to Mexico? That's where I have to go.
I don't care, just get me there.
One way, or round trip?
30. 55. Twenty more will get you back.
Beck's.
Heineken?
Genuine Draft?
I'll fuckin'take it. To go.
You know how that Toby is. Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
I think I burned my gun hand!
Well it's about time. Looks like you found yourself a helper too.
This road don't go to Globe, Grace where were you going to meet me?
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number. But then you make friends so easily. Don't you, Grace?
You never said anything. About the drapes.
You haven't even looked at them once.
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin'ya, girl!
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin'away, cause your Mama she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table. Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister. What were you doing with my girl?
What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just cause you Russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything...
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
I know.
Oh.
Okay.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
It means we're probably to tired to remember.
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
Oh shit...
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
Out again?
As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
We're supposed to be honest.
What about the game?
That counts.
It's like you resent us David. Resent the life you have.
Seventy five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
Was it serious?
I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in...'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment. '
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting. Now all I need is your credit card number.
That guy in green. Sometimes people carry weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying. If he's carrying, he'll step out of line.
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants. Like on t. v.
Telling when people have done something wrong?
I don't know what you're asking?
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?
Why'd you do that?
Jeremy. I'm going in. I have to do some things.
I'm going to work out.
There's nothing to do.
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
No Jeremy.
There's no more left?
I'm not scared.
Do you know why?
You're secret identity. That man was right.
I'm not. I just didn't connect it.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.
How so?
You and my mother would have a special connection.
... And everyone lived happily ever after.
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
You told them cowboys you had it.
What you gonna do when somebody comes to collect? FUCK'EM? FUCK'EM A THOUSAND TIMES? The kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. They won't just cut your face up a little. STUPID CUNTS!
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
He said...
Building his porch!
Maybe he ain't so tough.
Just wondered. Anybody could be scared.
I didn't mean no offense. I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up. Ned an'The Kid, my partners, are they...?
Scouting?
Oh. How long I been here?
Three days? I must be.
That big guy lookin'for me?
Oh. Yeah.
Me? No. No, I guess not.
Yeah. See?
Yeah, I guess.
Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin'over the little ones.
Yeah, I guess so.
Maybe I ain't.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
Oh.
About what?
What for?
Jesus!
She's passed on, Kid.
Been gone near three years now.
If you was to change your mind, might be you could catch me... due West to the Western Trail an'North to Ogallala.
Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!
Well, what were you lookin'at anyhow?
Easy, Kid, easy. Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
An'how there was two deputies up close pointin'rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an'how you pulled out a pistol an'blew them both away to hell... an'only took a scratch yourself. Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin'like it, shootin'your way out of a scrape like that.
You don't recollect!
He got the boy's horse.
What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin'on?
I got him.
Yeah, he's in there.
He's in there.
Yup.
You can shoot him.
Just SHOOT!
First one I ever killed.
How I said I shot five men... it wasn't true. That Mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... I busted his leg with a shovel... I didn't shoot him or nothin'.
We all got it comin', Kid.
Sure. Sure, Bill.
I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess.
I guess you won't mind my keepin'the bottle.
Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin'to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle.
P p p please, I'm not armed. M m my G god. You killed... Little Bill.
I never c c carry arms. I'm... a writer.
B b books. You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
Wh wh when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
I could tell you who was last, mister.
How long since you shot a gun at a man? Nine... ten years?
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an'we was young an'full of beans. Bill... if you was mad at'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin'' em...
Well, we thought we was doin'it for money... What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
Well, I guess they got it comin'... But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive.
This Kid, what's he like?
Yeah, an'I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
It ain't nothin', don't fret it. She don't like it much, you goin'off with me.
She gave me the evil eye.
I ain't blamin'her, Ned, I ain't holdin'it against her. She knew me back then... an'she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an'she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an'all. Us goin'to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters. Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an'again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot'em out of pure meanness.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Quincy, he was always watchin'me. Scared.
Hell, no. I'm just a fella now. Ain't no different from anyone else no more.
No. I mean...... an'get yourself a woman? You know?
Sometimes... yeah. I don't miss it all that much.
He hit you?
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
HEY, KID.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY.
Last night I said I missed my fuckin'wife... tonight I just miss my fuckin'bed.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
Yeah?
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin'fool.
I seen him.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Worms was comin'out.
Easy, Bill.
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
Easy, Bill, easy.
She was all covered with worms. Oh, Ned, I'm scared of dyin'...
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear?
Three.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
Only he wasn't carryin'no pistol this time.
Well, I come back, didn't I?
All that money... I mean... did you...?
No... I meant...
K k kill somebody?
N nobody... only you took your shotgun an'that pistol an'...
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
Well, you was shootin'every which way an'...
I'm a damn good shot. See that hawk up there? I could kill that hawk with one shot.
More.
Fuck you.
I ain't blind, you asshole.
How many men you killed? Ain't you gonna answer?
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin'with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
Five. I killed five of'em. That counts a Mexican I killed. He come at me with a knife.
He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an'not shoot no one.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
That was your idea, I wanted to...
I don't kill nobody without him.
We done that stuff.
Well, suppose he does?
That ain't what I mean.
I can't spot'em myself but you could. That red haired one, you could spot a half mile off, I bet.
I'll ride up close an'shoot'em!
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before. I'm more killer than him.
Hell, yeah.
Yeah.
What was the money for?
I don't get it.
Who?
 lt;  lt; It is longer than that. And not so dark.  gt;  gt;
 lt;  lt; Don't be stupid.  gt;  gt;
You've come far. You're a good man. I love you.
They want more time to think about investing.
They just said they wanted time.
I love you.
Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
Edie, please.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more creative?
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N. Y. P. D. for some answers they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics nothing you can do.
I don't know. This is bad.
Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
We all go. How about it, Keaton?
His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be ready which brings me to sunny spot number two. Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing.
If I'm going in, I want a stake.
You were waiting for a line up then, too. What happened with that?
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things
Never heard of him.
Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
I'11 be alright.
Forget it. I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
Fenster and Hockney?
Three million?
No killing?
We'll make it.
Hungarian?
What if I
Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever think to ask me? I've been
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
I work for Keyser Sate.
What about Redfoot?
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
Mr. So My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
Am I? 92 92 INT. HALLWAY FIFTIETH FLOOR
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin'shame he got shivved.
Some Limey. He's a middle man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him '
Did they charge him with anything?
I want to see him.
Where?
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
I'11 find him.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
Nothing. Something I forget it.
And I am sure you have a host of wild  theories to answer these questions.
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much.
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
Sure. And I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea
You got him wrong.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
Came from Redfoot.
And why leave this out when you talked to the D. A.?
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze or whatever you want to call him knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under'your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me. After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us.
What happened?
What call?
I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's
I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D. A. you didn't know who it was.
YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON.
YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
Why did he want you to live? A one time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat cripple? No, sir. Why '
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will.
NO.
This is all bullshit.
I knew him. He would never
You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a. s. a. p., unless you turn state's.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Immunity.
You're joking.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
Good. You ever been inside a hospital?
Ah. How did they treat you?
Four cases in three years...
... tell me about this case.
No we don't want this case in court.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
We thought it was just.
Yes.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
What is the truth?
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
Mickey told him to call.'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You meet him at the hospital. '
You know what that would mean? To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
They want to settle. It means a lot of money.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Your Honor...! Your Honor...
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only. When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn. As long as you understand that. It's got to be that way.
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
I'm going to uphold that.
Yes. It is a crime. A serious crime.
You would not...?
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
Just now...
... sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K. C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today. Isn't that right? Isn't that right...?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
You know these doctors could have settled out of court. They wanted a trial. They wanted to clear their names.
I do. Yes.
That's not my handwriting.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
We just...
I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did?
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
... Deborah Ann Kaye...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
Yes.
 I'm sorry...?
Do you know who her doctors were?
The most respected...
... the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I was held up.
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it? See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket. You follow me? I'm trying to help you.
... that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself. I myself would take it and run like a thief.
That's perfectly all right.
I had a witness disappear on me.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Defense...?
I believe that's the law... is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin. Let's not waste these people's time. Answer the question, Mr. Witness. Please. Would a nine minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
Listen to me, fella...
Are you done?
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy. We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end. Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
Exception!
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
I can't guarantee that...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
This is Miss Costello...?
Pardon?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
We have a renew your subscription offer...
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
I changed my life today. What did you do?
Why?
What Hotel are you staying at?
I'm a lawyer.
Really. How wonderful for you.
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
You just got lucky. D'you eat yet? Come on.
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face,  This is a sham. There is no justice...'but in their heart they're saying,'Maybe... maybe... '
Maybe I can do something right.
That's what I'm going to try to do.
Is this a bad time.
What happened...?
... and is that serious?
No, no, I'm just...
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
Yes.
That's not the question. It's over. Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
That's what I am.
Well, then what are you doing here?
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it? I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Not if you don't grow up...
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever you don't have to go to school...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure.
Yes. We've all got to let go.
What are you going to do?
Call the A. M. A. to Laura ... I can't talk now.... tell them you're Dr. Somebody... you have to find this nurse...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Where is he?
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him..
Uh...
... now who is that...?
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
... hey, I don't need your charity...
Come on. Let's get a drink.
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two hundred ten grand? Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it. We let them buy the case. That's what I took it for. You let this drop we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin'deer...
You Listen: you said to me,  if not now, when... '
... he's a good man...
... I have to stand up for her...
I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help. Mick, will you help me...? Will you help me...?
Admittance form is wrong.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
' Mary Rooney, forty nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
I'm going to get laid.
Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
They still have to take it to a jury.
Today is Tuesday. What?
Give'em a box of Macanudos.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
She's workin'the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
That's right.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O. R.'s going to take the stand.
What difference can that make...? All right...
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts.'K. C.'' Kathy Costello... '
How old are you, how many children... when did you last eat...
The Hospital...?
I need a cigarette! She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart... I need a cigarette...
It's locked?
... I'm sure you do...
... I know. I went...
Yes. Yes, I have.
... fifty thousand dollars?
... I understand...
... I understand...
Are we going to win? We have, you know, other tactics, though...
She told me.
I just saw her.
What?
Uh huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Four. You're great with these kids.
Who told you that?
Mrs. Simmonds.
I used to be a nurse.
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
What did she say?
One hour.
And did you write the numeral  one'down on the record, standing for one hour?
A single hour.
It's a long road that has no turning.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
... there are notations every thirty seconds...
... of the procedures...
But those notations stop...... four and one half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Four and one half minutes after her heart stopped. And they resume seven minutes...
... they start again three minutes earlier...
What happened in those three...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
Yes.
Because she was anemic. It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
So far you're great. You got a cigarette?
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin'place,'You must drop by with Pat and me...'Okay...?
... and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy. Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a'spinnaker'is got to be a saint. I told him'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?'He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over. Jimmy, gimme another drink. How are you?
Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake. As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail. P. S. He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years. You like that story?
He won't talk.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
You don't have to do it for a living.
How long have you been back?
And you like it.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers. And you've quit the force. A permanent physical disability?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
Someone dead.
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.
No.
How often does this happen?
Where'd she go?
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go? I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care. Scottie
I want you.
Scottie, I need a friend! Someone I can trust! I'm in a panic about this!
Ernie's.
Yes.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair.
Great grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death was Madeleine's grandmother.
But she doesn't know, about her background. She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
Nothing.
She is not my wife.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back. Good bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
My name is John Ferguson, and
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
You.
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
Judy Barton.
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's
It's a place to live, that's all.
About three years.
I told you! Right here!
Salina, Kansas!
I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Then will you for me?
Just dinner.
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Mmm.
Tomorrow night? Well
Tomorrow m but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
No? Then what?
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd " take care of me "?
Why? Because I remind you of someone? That's not very complimentary. And nothing would... happen...
That's not very complimentary, either.
Please! And don't look at me.
Yes
I want to! Come on!
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one is beautiful.
But why?
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!
No, you wouldn't let me. And I don't want to go...
No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you.
Judy, please it can't matter to you...
All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
We tried it. It didn't suit me.
Ernie's?
Well, after all, it's " our place. "
That's what I had in mind.
I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks. And... let's see... to start...
All in good time.
Can't you see?
No, it's all right.
But why? Why here?
Why?
And wanted to go on loving you. " And I said, " I won't lose you. " But I did.
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
Go up the stairs, Judy. I'll follow.
We're going up the tower.
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
Yes!
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
Ah, yes! I was a set up. I was the made to order witness. Where is he now?
We'll find him.
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you! Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
Do you remember where you were?
Where were you?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset. Ah... thank you for the fire.
When?
Oh... wandering about.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Wandering about.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
No, you are right, I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you... Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
I prefer John. There, that's done. And what do you do, John?
That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
No... it's wrong.
... Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects. But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it? What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind... It's a formal thank you letter. And a great big apology.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
Meet again, sometime.
No.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.
How can you be sure?
The oldest living things?
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever living.
Why?
And no birds sing.
No.
Where?
Have you been here before?
When?
Where?
No, don't ask me!
Why did you jump?
What was it inside that told you to jump?
No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!
... somewhere in the light.
What do you remember?
Would you know the room?
What else?
Where?
How do you know?
There's a name on the gravestone.
What else?
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
No!
I'm so afraid...... you won't let it happen...
I had the dream. The dream came back again...
Yes
Tell me.
And an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
It's all there. It's no dream.
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
Yes.
No... we're together...
Why?
Where?
Madeleine
Let me go! Let me go!!
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Please. Because I love you. He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her. And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style. Ah, tomorrow!
Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window. I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
How do you know? Personal experience?
What do you mean?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I had to quit, Midge.
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
I know. Everybody tells me.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
And sit behind a desk? Chairborne?
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
Well?
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back. It's a Mission number.
Could be.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
My... the acrophobia.
I think I can lick it.
I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
What do you want me to start with the Golden Gate Bridge?
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Oh! You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco! The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Pop Leibel.
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
I've told you enough.
Out. I've got things to do.
Out!
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Just wander.
Around.
Yeah.
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
What I've been doing?
Naturally.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
No, not exactly. Want to see?
What's that?
I said how's it going?
Well that's what I said.
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
Sorry Fish.
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85  of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
Name one.
I don't know why the floor was wet!
What did you say?
Don't point at me.
I have plenty of friends.
The hell I don't.
What are you fucking talking about?
Eat my ass!
Go home!
I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I? Prison Communications.
What are you doing?
What do you think you are doing?
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Why? Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance?
Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
Just stop.
I'm calling the police.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it. I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me... I can take care of this.
We can't do this.
No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
So that's what we're doing.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Alright. Let's do it.
Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.
You got us into this mess.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
Don't talk to me about character.
Who? What are you talking about?
Nobody's smoking anybody out.
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
I got children. I've got a life.
They're singing.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini Mart?!
Are you solid with that?
Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now... You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?
I won't do it.
If anything ever happens to me...
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
Where's the bathroom?
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
Nothing happened in Vegas.
Shut up Boyd! Micheal?
Lois please.
She's here. She's just... Hold on a second.
Who?
That's right.
She's in the bathroom... she's still working.
That's right.
We need padded chairs.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Call 911.
So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them. Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
What kind of words?
Go ahead.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
Boyd... What have we done?
What?
I said, what have we done?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
What?
I just want to get married.
No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
Just do it.
Take care of business.
And what does that mean? Are you insane?! You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
You got a nasty side to your thought process.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
Hold on a sec. Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
My what?
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
Okay fine.
Whatever you say Kojak.
I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
The hell I did!
I never heard that.
False.
Not true.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
New king.
Then what do they have?
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time... right? Am I right?
There's my point exactly.
Take Mexico.
Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico.
That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?
Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.
No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel.
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Easy Micheal.
Give me the Valium.
Come on tough guy. Listen to me. You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
Why can't we do it through the mail?
Can't we do it on the phone?
What do you mean, you think so?
The wedding cake check?
Photographer?
Florist?
Caterer?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
You forgot the tent?
Why?
Why did you forget the tent check?
You can't play around with these tent people.
What else have you forgot?
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
Don't you dare.
Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
Are we going to do this again?
I wouldn't know.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
How do you figure?
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
He is.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with... about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re evaluate some of your friendships...
Charles Moore for instants.
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
He's weird.
He's weird.
He's a great chef.
You expect more what?
Time out.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
You will not be common!!!
How much?
Kiss me...?
Keith do not trivialize this.
We're supposed to have gold trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
Not padded ones.
You go down there.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
I need your help.
I need your help.
Do you love me?
Take care of those chairs.
Maybe.
Do you love me?
Just call and let me know that your okay.
Have a nice bachelor party.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
That's sweet.
Well you should.
Just a bit of organizing.
Yeah. Nesting.
Go have fun. Not too much.
Where are you?
How late?
What about the chairs?
What okay?
The chairs.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.
Yeah. Sure.
Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just... we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business.
No baby. We'll all be right in.
No way.
Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
I know.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Okay. Okay.
Yes.
Don't even.
What?
What kind of stupid question is that?
What are you talking about?
Who's dead?
You fucked a prostitute?
You killed a prostitute.
Call the police.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
No buts. I've waited twenty seven years, twenty seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water!
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
So what do we do?
Move the bodies?
What?
No...
But...
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
It means she's insecure.
Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button... Micheal Brenn. Yes... Yes... Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6. 321 at 17. 28 for 6. 6 at 9. 256 out at 3432. 343. Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body.
Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
So?
Come on.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter... and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for... You get me?
That's my point! You see Man... burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it? You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.
Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one... It's done me all right.
I have no idea.
Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
Greenpeace.
Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim...
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading " Atlas Shrugged, " staring at himself in the mirror.
All week long.
I guess.
Pup corn?
That's a good one.
... regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape like state...
The post Vegas Man.
Okay boys, smile!
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
We will.
Well, I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling.
I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here?
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
Was that difficult to get?
You have no feelings toward...
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
You see, even the voice.
Only because you want it.
Yes, it is.
Never.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
And what do you know about life? When all is said and done you couldn't possibly understand.
Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed.
Maybe...
I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
Then you won't forgive me?
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
What for? She'll only look at me that way again... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.
If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
That's fifteen by seven?
Good.
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
That's good land.
Tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.
That doesn't matter; I like it.
But why? Why?
Why the bad temper?
Let her do what she wants. She doesn't bother us in any way. She minds her business and we...
You should have enough to do in this house... Come here and listen to this.
Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
Kill him and I'll tell you. If I don't keep my word, you can kill me too. There are thousands of pesetas. Kill him, idiot!
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
Well... is it so urgent?
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
And do you know that my mother and I had to suffer? If my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I'd be an architect now.
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
Do you intend to stay here for some time?
Is she coming back?
Why?
And let him get run over by somebody else?
I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want... I'll leave it to you.
Canelo!
They told me it isn't at the hospital.
Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time... This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through.
Don't say that.
He's lying through his ass!
You cannot leave...
There's been an accident.
Come with me.
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
A black bull!
Yes very, very big!
I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it?
Good, then let's go!
If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self control, and be a bit more humble to everybody.
That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
That will soon pass. It's nothing.
Have I slept long?
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
 There is one program with approximately 1. 3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it.
Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.
Jesus Christ. I know who the dominant personality is. Lindenmeyer.
Whatever.
Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?
Why would they be going there?
I wish we could hear them.
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter? I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you. You may not believe this, Parker,
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6. 7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first. New scar   you making it okay in there?
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
Do me a favor   keep sending them.
It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee?
Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist. LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
Fine   you want to stay here?
Sid 6. 7 is now armed.
If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach. Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
In other words, we collectively don't know shit.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6. 7 is. But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.
I need your help
What's the assignment?
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6. 7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.
Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.
This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release.
How do you know I won't run?
What did you find out?
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter. Did you find out where the bomb is?
Enough to level an entire city block.
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
You know how much man power you're talking about?
Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell.
Don't remind me.
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
A little less than yesterday.
John died.
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it   I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
Go to hell.
Enough!
Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better   to improve upon what was already done.
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him. Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done. The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6. 7?
What happened when he was 17?
You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
I am impressed.
Who said that?
He's part of the mix. Sid 6. 7 is a composite.
But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son  of a bitch before he kills anybody else.
And I'm going to make sure of it. Give me your wrist.
She's beautiful, you know?
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it. Where to?
What does that mean?
Sounds to me like a well  educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does. Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.
Don't worry about it, all right?
Relax. I know what you meant.
Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
You know I am.
Tell him.
I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing. Whatever it is, he isn't finished...
Authority still makes me nervous.
You're not capable of it.
I was wrong. And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
Sid 6. 7 isn't Grimes.
That, or living through him...
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6. 7 and you've got his module. You're free to go   right now. Why are you going to do this?
That's why I'm asking.
More or less.
My guess is dead.
I don't know.
Then shoot him already.
I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison. You know, we have so much in common   we have such history together   I've been thinking we should become friends.
GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
Where did you plant the C 4?!
Where did you plant the C 4?!
Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his Re  Election Rally...
I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now. Beam me up, Scotty!
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
Do they have to look so... robotic?
What if he's busy tonight?
What are you saying...
... on the way in.
It's the White House.
Well, well, well, well, wait a minute, we got 86 percent. We bring'em back tomorrow, the charts go up, they don't go down...
You know what? This is good. This is terrific, and I'll tell you why: it's cost effective. This is....
No, this is great.
... but the President wonders about the Possible Albanian Backlash...
King, we've got to be on the streets in...
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
What can it hurt.
Miss, we are going to ask you to sign this little sheet of paper...
Can we have a white one, please...
Izzat the thing...
We've got to put that, into the Inaugural. " I have here, a ribbon. You haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often now. For it is the Proud Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign.... "
Much more... uh, he have much more time to " serve? "
And? NO. I don't wanna know. What do you mean " and... "?
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
Oh, Lord....
... where?
Fuck the world. Try a ten A. M. pitch meeting, no sleep, coked to the gills, and you haven't even read the material.
How do we explain that? Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a pitch. You see? His records say he was in prison... as they must, as all the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the secrecy required of....
... the Harvester...
You're not thinking right, Pal...
And what is bigger than a triumphal Homecoming...?
Alright. Look here, any of you kids hear in this room: what you hear here, what you say here, what you do here, f'it got out, you leaked it. Tell'em what they need to know.
Well. Alright. What is it? What's, he, uh...? He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...? What's the thing? You people get ahead, you sure get nervous.
Don't you want to know if it's true?
Front page. Washington Post. Tomorrow.
It won't hold.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie
Do it...
What would do that...?
I'm working on it.
It's going to be fine. It's going to be... you remember in 88, when...
Tell me again.
We can't afford a war.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the " appearance " of a war.
But, but, but, " they " would find out.
... the...
Yes
... but...
... you want us to go to War...
Why?
... they sound what?
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
Who?
What do you know about them?
Precisely.
What did they ever do for us...? You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B 2 Bomber.
Here's what you got to do: Get your Press Office, Right now. To deny; There is no report of Albanian Activity. They have to deny it. Now, get the C. I. A.
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The hostages, but that was a naturally occuring... It was a put up job? But where was the, where was the money in that?
... the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from that...
We'll be back tonight.
Waal, that's where you want em...
... what's the Long View?
Yes. That's true. But...
I live for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off. Watcha got for me?
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
Press thought " no, " whaddaya think...?
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A. M. Andrews...
No rain.
... got to be something. She gives him the sacred... And tells him: this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
Yes: she is saying this in Albanian, but she's doing it not to be uh... But because, she explains, that is the only way it can be understood by her Aged and Sainted Mother, who is standing there with her, dressed in her Traditional...
... uh huh...
Find out is there any chance we can get some rain tomorrow, will you...?
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
Maybe he's just a patriot.
How long you been up, you need a nap.
Nashville...?
You're tired, Ronnie.
8 days and we bring it back home....
Well, keep your wits about you, and let's see if we can't...
... brazen it through...
War's over, Pal.
How's your wife?
Napoleon said, fellow won't sell you his life, but he will trade it to you for a little piece of ribbon.
Never quit a winner.
All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
Hello? No, operator...
I'd like to mention a few names, who...
I was acting as a Private Citizen. Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with. Or in whose employ...
And I take this opportunity to suggest that, equally, I admit to nothing, and that I would like my lawyer present.
And I think that the Security of the Country would be best served by its citizens obeying its laws. Gemme a Federal Judge, gemme search warrants, all premises controlled by our friends, and bench warrants for the two of...
WHERE'S MY FUCKING PIIIILLLLLLL...?
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
ON CAIN, AS SHE LOOKS AROUND.
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
And I can only say, to those family members, of group 303, which members are, I know, as I speak, gathering to comfort you, the parents of the missing man, I can only say,
We're locked into Albania.
The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour.
Out in Oklahoma.
Whaddaya think?
My name is Ronald Brean.
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
S'only got to hold for another few days.
What are you interested in?
Ask it.
Why do people go to war?
Why do they go to War?
Would you go to War to do that?
Well, I have, too. Would you do it again...? In't that why you're here? I guess so. N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against? Your " ability to fight a Two ocean War " against who? Sweden and Togo? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against? That time has passed. It's passed. It's over. The War of the Future is Nuclear Terrorism. It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own governments, have blah blah blah. And to go to that war, you've got to be prepared. You have to be alert, and the public has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the future, and if you're not gearing up, to fight that war, eventually the axe will fall. N'you're gonna be out in the street. And you can call this a " drill, " or you can call it " job security, " or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you: you said, " Go to War to protect your Way of Life, " well, Chuck, this is your way of life. Innit? And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting. And there ain't no war but ours.
There was a group of Girlscouts here from Indiana last month. One of them expressed an interest in a Frederick Remington bust. The president took her into the oval Office, for a period...
... Yes.
... Good...
Dartmouth
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
There is no B 2 Bomber,
Party's gonna need more than a couple bucks now.
If we can hold the break in the dam for ten days, til the election, we...
What do you think would hold it off?
I'm a Jew in Show Business. Why come to me?
Here's the Short Course: Fifty Four, Forty or Fight. What does that mean?
Remember the Maine...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
We remember the slogans, we can't even remember the fucking wars. Y'know why. Cause it's show business. That's why I'm here. Naked girl, covered in Napalm. Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi. Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten the war. Gulf War? Smart Bomb, falling through the roof. 2500 missions a day, 100 days, One Shot of One Bomb. The American people bought that war. M'I getting through to you? War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till some G. I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days. N'then It's show business, Mister Moss. That's why I'm here.
Why not?
" They Got To Know? " Stan...? Get with it. Who Killed Kennedy...? I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk Driver. You watched the Gulf War. What did you see? Day after day, the one " Smart Bomb " falling into a building. The truth, I was in the building when they shot that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1 / 10th scale model of a building.
How the fuck do we know. You take my point?
It's not " war. " It is a Pageant. It's a Pageant... Like the Oscars... why we came to you...
N'it's a crying shame. But you staged the Oscars...
You know, you're a writer, that's your script. You're a director... But if you're the producer... what did you do? What did you do? All you've got is the credit... Some plaque on the wall...
Hell, I'd just do it for the hell of having done it, for a story to tell...
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm kidding... " It's a pageant "
" The Country Is At War. "
... Yoha, Yoha... Yoha. Why Albania?
They got to have something that we want.
What do we have that they want?
Why would they want that?
We don't need an Act Two.
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
It's a teaser, absolutely right,
Well, you could have one, but it'd be a very ineffective war... We're done in 10 days...
W... what?
" Back End "... count on it.
At the Airport? Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
The war ain't over til I say it's over. This is my picture. You think you're in a spot? You think this is a tight spot? Try making the Hunchback of Notre Dame when your three lead actors die, two weeks from the end of Principal Photography. This is... this is... this is just... Act One: THE WAR. Act Two... the... uh...
Yeah...?
No, it's... I'll, yes, I'm holding, but... No, it's...
Where is he now?
... we get our hands on him?
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Mmm.
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
I've come to feel It's my thing. You know, you take a job... You take a job, and, many times, it's just a job. And then...
... isn't it? Hey, what the hey... it's all part of the bittersweet...
Yeah, we'll gettem in their cars. I'm slowing down... No, no. Look, lookit: I think it's a mistake, well, I'll tell you why: you got'em by the balls, Squeeze. Because Schumann's the Shark. He's... Jaws. You have to tease'em... You don't puttem in the first reel of the movie... Bring'em back slow, the President... No, no, put him on. Put him on. President wants to reveal Scbumann before the election.
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now. No. Lookit: it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Hey, lcokit: any business...
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
Well, I'll be damned if I know... you know... doing this thing... You know what the worst word is, in the English Language? It's  retirement. " What the hell was I thinking of? Hell, I used to...
Getting off on the inaugural? Gonna go...
The Albanian Campaign.
You've got something, there...
Uh...
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
An anti psychotic...
How's our friend?
Uh huh... why?
We have no home. We're vagrants. N'each man's hand's against us. We killed Old Shoe... We killed the Schuster... spend our life in a packingcrate... Where are you going...?
He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
What he went through in Albania...
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
You got a dime....?
Get on the phone, have'em fly in a... whaddaya need to be a citizen? A Judge? Whaddaya need? A Judge...? Call in a Judge, call in a Federal Judge, and... If you're concerned about him, being an... " immigrant. " Make him a citizen... Eh? Guys... what's all this mopery, we...
Naw, naw, we own the airways...
Show Must Go On.
Prouder of this, than anything I ever did in my life. I want to thank you, Ron. Want to thank you.
No, I don't think you can do that.
No, I don't think you can do that, Stanley...
Stanley. Stanley... you knew the... Stanley. You knew the deal when you signed on.
No, the deal isn't changed. The Deal isn't changed. You can't... what is it? Money? Money? You want Money?
But you always knew you couldn't take the credit....
Let's take the bridge from nine, and the intro from one, and...
Hold it a minute, Benny, we're going to tweak it a bit. This may take a while.
What guards Us Against Canada...?
When do you bring'em back? Schumann.
Tell'em to fly the Inaugural Speech past me.
We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune.
Thank God this is America.
No, he's back in Nashville.
We are mobilizing to defend her.
No problem. Here's the...
You like it?
Fine. Good.
And one of them is in love with the sister of...
The hats.
Why a beret?
"... the special detachment... " Good! What is it?
... you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later.
Why...?
... who are you? Who are you sonofabitches...
... gimme some help...
... just want to Get Back to the Beans...
Is today Laundry Day...?
Lemme talk to him. Will? Shoe?
Lemme talk to him. Shoe? Shoe...? You in there...?
If I ever need surgery, get me the heart of an arb like Yurovich, it's never been used... Happy Holideals Harold...
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
I'll grow old. We'll both die. And we'll never have known each other. That's sad. At least one drink for a dreamer... What's your favorite drink?
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.
... if I had your looks, better.
... not that you learned anything, Chunk.
... you take that Anacott Steel?
Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
Hey, things could be worse. It could've been my money. Let me help you out, rookie.
It concerns his future!
Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook Gekko the Great's hand and you still got all your fingers. He's not the only elephant in the jungle.
Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn'em and burn'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there.
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus. Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
That's right, next time a little birdie talks to you, talk to me too E. F. Hutton.
Hey the door was open.
You know what you need, buddy buddy an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum to change that shitty attitude of yours.
Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders.
Sell?
Speak English will ya.
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
You coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now,'stead of going off and bein'a salesman.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35, 000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
So come home and live rent free,'stead of that cockroach palace you live in.  50, 000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made  37, 000 last year and you...
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
... this drug testing is driving my guys nuts. I got flagged for my blood pressure pills. The only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. I kept telling'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati. And I was right.
Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all I can advise is hold on to that stock Dad...
The FAA announcement.
Don't start, alright.
Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money?
... don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
What do I need a fancy suit for. I don't hobnob with the jet set. I just fix their planes.
Whatever night you like.
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
I guess it's time to hit the road.
... And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
What if he asks where I got the money?
What if they call him?
You sure?
I don't know anything!
Didn't he tell you? That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
What was that?
So, does " this guy " have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Okay.
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
Yeah, right...
... and if I did, what's in it for moi?
.... Relax Roget You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.
You're just the President of the company, what do you know?... Come on.
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective less than one visit to the doctor.
So what firm you with, pal?
... going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
... A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?
... don't like airlines, lousy unions...
... for my kid Rudy 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
Sure... relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?... you wanna put it in my account?
Excuse me sir.
... finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly...... about 50 thousand.
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that? I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
... Can't it wait? I'm good for it.... Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up.
You're learning, sport...
You don't understand. I want to be surprised... astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line. Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.... an old Russian proverb " a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar. " I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake up call. Go to work.
Close to two million. But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there... inside.
The three unions. It's 43  of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is  850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G. G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to  350 400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me... and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation... Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost  60, 000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for  600, 000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip. We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...... you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now... take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Are you with me Buddy?
You sandbagged me on Bluestar. I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
Oh really? Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this, you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although... I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Where is it?
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the houseplant.
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and... my first yuppie.
Only if I want something bad enough.
How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
... a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
I don't.
Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
I'll let you know.
You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word a mover, shaker.
... that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...... and you're going along for the ride.
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
I'm looking... and I sure don't like what I see.
I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
Old values. Buy.
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me buy.
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
You told him about us?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
I can't... and I won't.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
He still likes you
He did?
Businessman?
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
Yeah
What's that?
Us is over. You had your chance you blew it.
A little what? CHINA See. You don't even speak French.
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
And your coff excuse me, caffeine sir
And uh, your nicotine sir
Allow me sir
Have a nice day sir
Good evening sir.
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
Tony and China?
Wooo. Jealously rearing its ugly head.
I know what you mean.
Come on.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Oh that explains everything.
Big deal!
Right.
This. is killer.
YES!
I know that.
Of course you will.
Why?
I think playing in a band called " Bitch " might put a dent in the whole " perfect family " thing.
Yes it is. Can we please not do that? Please? Cause it is.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
I started seeing things.
What?
Then we both are.
I'm running late here. I just came back for my briefcase.
This really isn't a good time.
When... when will she be back?
Oh kay...
I didn't kill my wife.
You're the flower lady.
I've seen you. From the window.
And I'm afraid. Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
That's not... It's not like that.
I know. And I'm sorry. I've been consumed with... my daughter left... for school.
I'm sorry. It's for the flowers. Why don't you...
For scaring you like I did. When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
Right. I'm sorry.
And these roses. They're much prettier up close.
You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe? That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
I couldn't catch my breath. That's not a metaphor, that's... And I panicked. I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there... I tried to leave him. Went to my mother's in Boston. He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
I'm sorry that I frightened you like that. But I was so touched by your concern. I've been lonely here. Perhaps we could be friends.
We know each other.
I didn't sleep with him.
He was so pissed.
We were suite mates.
Oh God...
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
And I kicked ass. My best stuff. Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition... and I cried.
I'm not. Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks.
You are?
Cause... your... only daughter just went away to school... who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Well good. So you're human.
Wow. Got here just in time. I brought you this.
Jody
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Thanks, but I'm fine.
It's niiice.
Absolutely.
You got it.
Seance.
Telling you...
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
In the window. Norman's at work.
This.
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
What?
Then what was it?
Something was there. You saw it.
Yes. Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
And he's the real thing. Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
But Claire
Adamant?
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you... but partly... partly because I was relieved.
I had just been left by Richard. I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
Alone? On a two lane road? With a ton of Valium in your system?
I don't know.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
No. She wanted me to know the truth. Now that I do... I think she's at peace.
I can't believe this is happening.
That could take days. I need to do something now. Don't you see? She wants us dead.
I have an idea. But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
Jody he was lying.
I guess not.
Trust me, Claire. You hear something... change the subject. You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake. You know what happened. The rest is only details. And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those. If you want to put this back together... just let it go.
Three weeks.
Claire, I have to show up for the
How is it?
It's okay if you're not.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
You know what I mean.
To get my life back. To have some time for myself. Some time for us.
Wanna fool around?
I'm finished at three. No. Squash with Stan.
I'll be there.
Did she say that?
Remember how we were?
Why?
... when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
Claire...
Nothing's going to happen. Besides, I have to work tonight. The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer. This is...
It's what I've been working for.
Promise?
Hurry...
No, no. It's fine.
Did you call the police?
Of course.
I don't know. Just... whispering.
Yep.
You know what that does to me.
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
"... especially Spencer's Theorem... "
"... of Perpetual Distances. " Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop. " I'm afraid you've mistaken me, " I say...
"... for my father. "
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
Did you tell her?
You didn't?
Oh, right. Yes. Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart. Wouldn't hurt a fly.
Shhhh.
He did. She's in the picture. I went over to look and she's gone. The table was set for one.
No, no, no, no. The soil on the shovel, his shovel... that's clay. It's not from here, believe me, I... All right, look at this.
From the sun. It's a reflection on the glass.
It's a ghost.
Okay. Okay. I'll bet there's... Look at this.
I didn't do that.
Maybe. Point is... not me.
She was lonely, I talked to her. Norman, I know how it looks, but
Dressed?
When?
Oh.
Tonight?
... like it never even happened...
Five minutes?
We're going to be fine.
Norman...
I never said...
This is the Feur thing?
Who did?
How did you
What are you...? No.
Sabotage?
The accident...?
Norman, this isn't about you. This is something that's happening to me. It's not to get even... and it's not some warped bid for attention. Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
No! Not sweetheart, no. I believe in what's happening. I don't want to, but I do. I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
Really big bed.
Call ya later.
We walked all night...
A cheap wine glass from the caterers. You started crying. I tried to comfort you...
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio. I took you home.
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving. It was a hard time.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
No. I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
The...
... I'm positive this time...
It's Madison Fra
It's too rough.
Your wife...
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her... in my house.
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened. And when I woke up in the hospital... somehow it hadn't. Until now.
That's not what I'm sayi
I never asked you to quit!
To Caitlin!!
Stop...
I'm not going to listen to this.
Claire...
Of course she did, Norman. What else could it be?
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
What?
How can you be sure?
Claire...
Look for antiques...
Adamant.
Little village down seven. Supposed to be charming.
Do you know it?
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
I'm cooking you dinner.
I know.
Don't I, Norman? YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE. Of a woman you killed!
I don't believe you.
Mauduh...
: Would you stop it!
: What do you mean " They " are? Are you officially a woman now?
A spacial entity. An organized energy. something that precedes our definition of existence.
I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.
Two heartbeats.
Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood... surely they sense the child you carry and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp... Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
Rowan.
NO! she's pregnant, Aaron. she's got that to deal with and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this. don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me... Listening to my heart, aren't you...? The Timex still ticking...?
Yes and you have. Do you see...? He was passing over into death but the witches sent him back to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
Then tell me. Is it Lasher....
He chose ME for ROWAN when I was a child!
Gifford that box glued to your hands...?
In the bayou, they have a saying...'You choose the music for the dance but fortune picks your partner.'Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.
C'mon now give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
Giff shuttup. you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things
Gifford Mayfair I'll cook your tongue on a spit! witches!
Who is this...?
I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.

What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
When is the funeral...? I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
I'm coming down there!! And it you put my mother in the ground betore I arrive, you'll wish you'd never seen my face! IS THAT UNDERSTOOD...?!
In the coffin, my dear. where else...?
I might as well be Rowan Smith or Jones! you cut me off from every
There are things I have to know!
Eighty million doll?
Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead
You're a monster.
You have the Mayfair eyes. Tell me, Rowan what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
Just like your mother and all the others that felt him and used his power and went to hell with a smile!
Witches. Rowan. that is what we are.
... and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy! you are the sum of his desires
But I had to use my hands. None before you could kill with their mind. Graham, my dear. Your uncle...?
Help us. Do what you can.
Uh then he be just
He's herniating! Forget OR. He's dead batore he's oft the elevator Get me a trephine tray Anesthesia stat! We need him intubated and blow down!
There are things you will not tell him.
YOU VIOLATED ME!!! ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
You bastard...
To love, you must be able to feel.

If that were true, I would not be here.
From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain it is a Mayfair who has wanted me! suzann. and Deborah. Stella Marguerite Antha Diedre All of them. And you will have a child...
But I could understand. I want to understand!
Do not tell me that!
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
Then help me for his sake...
Only you...
I do not understand...
There was no thought. There was no act. That is not what I am.
That is what you must discover. see what I am, my love. With all your power see me, and know what I am.
My jury's still out on that,
You know doors and keyholes are common signposts in out of body
No. I'm not. Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
HARDER!
Yessssss...
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's... The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
Nope My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth. El1ie was my only blood relation. so she brought me here... the day after I was born.
Doctor's orders?
You don't know what you meant because you don't know me.
I'm serious. You don't
Stop it.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
You could fly down tomorrow. I could be there the next day I think I can last that long without you.
Rowan...?
What's wrong..?
Goodbye, Michael. I love you.
Ro you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings. I mean that's CRAZY.
I am! And so are you. You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause  Michael, if you don't want
I've come home, Michae1, for the first time. I want to stay here with you.
Michael this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff
Maybe he's just waiting...
Either do I. I love you, Ro. You know that. You're a total mystery to me but I love YOU.
Guess so. I keep thinking about the witches when I was... down there There was caring. They saved me, Ro. They said'go back'... Wel1 I came back to you to love you. I like seeing it that way, y'know...?
So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Michael!
It's not some fairytale in an old book. Michael look at me. I didn't choose this, Michael. This is who I am. I love you.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
I'm serious. Whatever it was it's still there inside me, isn't it change and all...?
Nah I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas. Grayson.
Yyou look terrible. You're exhausted. You practically live at the goddamn clinic. Even pregnant women who aren't doctors know that You can't
I I... I can't, Michael. There's stuff at the clinic
I can't leave now. Don't ask me to explain! I just can't!
Why bother to ask, Ro...? Why don't you just make me stay,..?
How'bout a backward hex with a three quarter twist...?
No.
On which planet...?
Go away, GODDAMNIT!
Yes. Partly. It's it's Stu do you believe in
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
He's got great hands.
I like him. He can stay.
Is that what you were doing...?
Standard for a Mayfair marriage. Rowan there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael that is it's in the will for centuries. Tradition enjoins, Rowan. of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
Don't give me shit what do you want?
I heard something like that
A person could get killed round here just for working late
Yes it's about bank safety deposit boxes I wonder if you might just explain how they work and maybe even show me round.
But If you could show me round now and I'll meet you later?
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
So there is only one key...
And it can't be forged?
All the time?
I know what you mean I'll meet you at VINNIES WINE BAR at six if you like. And don't make any plans for this evening...
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER don't you remember?
Tell me ELLEN CARTER Forgive me for being so pushy, but aren't you a novelist? Didn't you write that terrific book'The Color of Fear'?
What's with all the locks and hammering
Don't worry Is that my hammer Well Just make sure that it's put back in the garage...
And how long have you been a dentist?
I don't know
No the police say I've killed fourteen but I've not I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden I probably couldn't even show you where I put them one girl, number eight I think the press called it she wasn't even mine I don't know who did it but I didn't
Oh anywhere whenever I needed to Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets they believe so easily you know,'Look, I have something to show you'I would say and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife she just froze, and said what do you want? I said, You know what I want. But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight. The real problem with my work is the blood there is so much of it and it all spurts out so fast like a fountain. It made such a mess of
I don't know
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
What did you do with her?
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white why white white clothes, blonde hair...
Is'their'colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours so what are people who wear white?
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
Then why did you marry her
You've killed but you're not a killer
Why not? Please it would help me
My sister My ADOPTED SISTER
STEPHANIE loved me she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me she was just old enough. We had a ball for years we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow... And we did... We would play games she would be the executioner and I would be the convict She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
It's not that I just don't want any sugar
WAIT FOR WHAT!?
Yes but you live here too If it were your house?
What?
I'm your landlady
Is LESLIE here?
He saved my life you know has he told you...
So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?
You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
As it happens, I was at home alone maybe we could solve each others problems?
No a dentist
Yes, come on in...
Yes, that would be nice I'll call round some time...
INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR Scotland yard... Can I have a word?
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
Oh no sir just making some enquiries... Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you she'll understand
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt in your mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked.
I defy any and all limits.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
And nobody knows you're a virgin! Aw, who are we kidding...
For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
Check it out!
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L. A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
And some really fast cars.
I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
Give me those!
You'll never believe who's in there.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
You go first.
Well. The prom's coming up.
And I was wondering.
If you don't have... I mean...
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
Oh, Ted, DUH. I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
You know... take the pictures?
That was code for " I like you. "
Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes... all by myself.
I mean, what do you think?
Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.
Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces. Are you hungry?
Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.
We love our lives just the way they are.
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
We miss our family.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
You're way ahead of me again?
The lesson being?
I'm getting so good at this.
They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Whatever helps you cope.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
Well, good. Every little bit helps.
Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.
Want a lesson?
It's your car. These are all your cars.
Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. " Like a woman, purring with ecstasy. "
The one with the horses.
I almost didn't recognize you without... you know... that stallion between... your... uh... legs.
Don't worry. He found the chocolate room.
And who IS Ted Nelson?
Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS.
After graduation... maybe we could go away together?
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
But don't worry... we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.
My legacy.
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
And the girl I love, she hates " Heaven. " If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?
Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, " The Girls of Xenia. " Just to show my appreciation.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
It's really late... do your parents know where you are?
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
My new bike.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no brainer.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
Just a formality.
Are they okay?
I miss them, too.
You're a peach.
That's a crappy thing to say.
You ever look down on them again and call them " grocers " like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
Do it. I triple dog dare you.
It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
In what sense?
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
Me?
Really? You wanna write about me?
I don't get the distinction.
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
I guess.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Funny you should say " peachy. "
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
A little respect would be nice, that's all.
You're implying she's, what, a gold digger?
Why can't you be nice to me?
Whatever.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
I see.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
I mean my father.
It's all so complicated.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
And then what?
You're amazing.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
That's two words. And I'm out of the " exposed " business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
He's on the move?
Let's do it.
At least it's not another 4 H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
What about you?
Tell me more.
I see.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very " Cosmo. "
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Come on.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
But absolutely true.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
Which explains the continued success of " Heaven " for how many decades?
You think you're working with chimps here?
Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.
I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need to go to college, learn a few things, you know.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
Let your fingers do the walking.
I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
Yeah, I'm doing fine. I have so much to tell you. I don't even know where to begin.
It's okay, Mom. Trust me.
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
You promise you'll finish school?
You're free. You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
Bad news.
I'm just a messenger.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
Your fathered owned the entire " Heaven " empire. You own it now. Any questions?
... is accusing me of rape. Jimmy told me. Apparently I'm the last to know...
This is insane.
The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle. You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam. You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one.
She's going to wash your Jeep?
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
I'd like that.
Ray. Stop calling. I told you the dental records will take time...
Could be hers. Types match. Could be a lot of other people's too...
Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye. He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
About Suzie?
He used to come around here. He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
No. Not after that night. I don't know what happened. Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy. Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night. It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away. That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
She had it, before she drank herself to death. Wasn't exactly a love child...
Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child. He was a good boy, till the army took him.
I know you do.
They were in me. Both places... you know.
He said something like, " Do you want it dirty7 " or something. I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
Yes. I said stop. I screamed. I mean that's how it sounded in my head. He hurt me...
No. I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated. But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
Then what?
You mean he withdrew...
Try, Kelly.
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
Maybe she used another name.
All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
This is where she lives. She wants to talk. Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all. I busted her once for possession. she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
I thought of that. Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo. Your reputation is getting trashed. You want to stop the bleeding. You don't want to sit in jail for three months. Unless...
Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
The job looks okay to us. But look at it from his point of view. The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege. But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
Eliminate the competition.
Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
Where's the body?
What if I'm right, Gloria? What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong? What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
If I'm wrong about those teeth it's a promise.
He's leaving the country. And I don't give a shit.
It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let'em do it. I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track...
Why is that?
Yeah.
No.
Yes.
I guess.
He said, " No little bitch can ever make me come. "
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years. We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
I don't care. You heard that girl's statement. I think he's dirty. Get me a case.
We've got three. Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
Ray. The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible. What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder. I did her rights.
She looked shaky, but lucid. I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door... I think I looked away. A split second. Then, bingo. Just like that. She puts a knee into my groin. There was this coffee table between us and the wall. She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case. Thing had a glass door. I could hear it breaking. I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough. Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun. I yelled at her to put it down. She got off a shot. I took it in the shoulder. I... I had no choice. I returned fire. Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
And then what... he touched you? Did you maybe flirt a little...
Suzie! Did this man rape you?
Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
Ms. Toller. I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
A ride. You want one?
Yeah, sometimes. Lots of the kids hang out here. You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me. Right? And Sam. Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere. He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it. Stay strong and he can't do shit.
You can trust me.
You are.
About what? How to improve your breast stroke?
I've been a cop for a while, Kelly. It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three. And then there's the love angle. I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill head around, now that you have the money?
Sam! Hi!
No thanks to you.
Jesus. Well, I do too, sometimes...
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
Don't bother. I'm taking a trip.
A friend of mine bought a boat.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.
We have to stick with the plan.
Shit. I was afraid of that. She left this garbled message on my machine. Can you calm her down?
No! Christ. Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you. You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
Then do it. I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight. We'll figure something out... Okay?
God, I've been calling you.
I can't help it. He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him? She's not that way. I think he did something...
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
I don't know. I want to see you...
But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
Say you love me.
No little girl can ever make me come.
Um huh. And guess what else? I have toys.
Forget it.
I know how deep her pockets are, Ken. I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... It doesn't add up. Sandra Van Ryan's got'em running scared. And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless.
There's nothing for them to get.
I just want my life back...
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Just like that? These people ruined your life, bro.
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
Suzie Toller is dead. You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
It doesn't look like it.
Well, you're half right. Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts. Somebody's got to go.
You, Kelly, Sam.
Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to. We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...
Shut up.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it. Anyway, I'm going through a drawer. I hear a car. I look out the window. I see Nicole driving away. I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
Yes.
Yes.
I could, but it's confidential. Look, the point is, we didn't talk. I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
Yes. Mainly to turn her toward the door. I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
With a thirty five inch bustline in a wet T shirt with no bra...
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation. Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
Yeah, or get me drowned.
Come off it, man... It was an accident.
No, no. Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play. We'll go through it all again tonight.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
Trust me, the guy's dirty. He'll like it. Especially the part about offing me. Now get out of here. Go make yourself a new friend.
Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them.
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Sorry, Sandy. I've got plans.
Swamp's where it's at, Sandy. Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of. You ought to try it some time.
No.
Didn't you see her this morning?
Artemus Gordon. Bach, he's the composer.
Valet? You jest of course. I am a U. S. Marshal.
Congratulations. Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Interesting. Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes? Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
" Ay, there's the rub. " Take a look at this file on Professor Morton. Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.
" Gadget guy? " While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
Always hoping. Or this...
Good Lord, man. The world is changing. And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention. We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Try what?
Yes, aha. A brass screw.
Potentially. This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues. The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology. Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Yes. Starting with a screw. Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Absolutely. Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
My disguise. And here...
Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
Do your own mingling. I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.
All right. How about this? We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
Yes. Now, observe....
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
All that jumping and kicking.
That's right... That's good.
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas. Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
So... spontaneous. All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
Well... that, too.
Uh... how long ago was this?
Thank you.
You go ahead. I'll stick with Loveless.
A cylinder recorder. My own design.
It is?
Yes. And a much nicer one than ours.
It's a town!
We oughta get a couple of those rockets. Voom! We're there before we left!
And people are actually fooled by that?
My pleasure.
I know! I know!
We've got to stop him right here, now! With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
There's only seventy eight.
All right, all right... It'll be okay. I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
Well, sure. Didn't you get your orders?
You? Dr. Pemberton? Of course. How novel.
Wonderful! Our new friend from the wild west. Please...
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory. Texas.
Yes, in a way. I'm the Doctor's social secretary. I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
You most certainly do.
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
Thank you. But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
Oh, I would hope not.
I try. Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
That would be correct. Orders from the President himself. Trans portation at your beck and call. No delays. Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.
French?
French? Damn it, I want my own man on this case. Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
And now the job's yours.
Really? Must be a dangerous business.
Philistine.
Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
Call it what you like. The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West. It belonged to my beloved grandmother! Now I intend to have it back. My own country!
The first.
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West! A town a day will disappear! Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park. Next, I level all of Albuquerque! Yes, that's right. Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there. What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me! After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
We'll explain on the way.
A Southern gentlemen. I don't recall his name. I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
When are they coming?
In an hour they're gone!
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Are you scared?
Kill him!
A magician  makes  magic. Any fool can use it.
Then I will teach you.
We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self. But what's this got to do with it?
What's the magician's weapon?
The art of transformation!
Now use it.
Just do it!
She's too powerful, Raziel
Madmartigan.
I don't know much about him.
Here. Hold her.
She requests the presence of your self and the young princess.
You're the guardian, aren't you?
Why not?
Milking?
I've seen pictures.
Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Oh sure, Fred.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
Just do it!
Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
What's that, Sam?
Are they going to kill you?
What are you going to do?
Have you got your gun on now?
Amish.
What have you got?
So one of them got to him.
You know who?
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
What's her name moved to Buffalo.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut... It fits, Paul... Fifty five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac. He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now. And now the stuff is worth five grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty five gallon drum.
Just us.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
I've already got something worked out. Be seeing you.
There'll be another train. The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there.
You have no right to keep us here.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
It's not a joke.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.
They kid a lot.
She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
You couldn't wait until morning?
What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial?
But why?
But 
Can I have something to drink?
How long?
How long have I been here?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for. That is not for Samuel.
Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking. You can wear these.
Buttons are Hochmut.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
No. I'd want a public phone.
But Stoltzfus said...
You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
We had some lemonade and he left.
What else can you do?
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus'tea.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
I was being foolish?
You're so sure of that?
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough. Just as I could live yours!
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
That's God's way!
Here. Whenever you want them.
Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?
It won't happen again.
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
Listen to me  Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.
Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
I'm coming.
That's more like it. Where are you at, anyway?
Make that 1790.
You'd lie to protect him.
You're the first one he'll contact.
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him 
But... if you had to guess?
John said you're Amish.
Oh.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night. Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first. Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
God, Fred...
No? Why not?
Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
Looks dead...
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look... Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting! Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
I will be the judge of that.
You shame yourself.
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different. Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Lean on him.
You have no right here!
Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.
Nobody's going to hurt your son...
I wish dawdie was with us.
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the
Dorothy! Dorothy! We're busy!
No
Oh, Auntie Em it's you!
No
Well, Dorothy was walking along the
All right, Mrs. Gale. But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and
To see?
If she?
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
Times being what they were, I accepted the job, retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get away. And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
Oh
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents Oh, stop it!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
Yes, I'm all right. Oh I fell in and and Zeke
Oh, please give me back my dog!
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
No! Fool, that I am! I should have remembered those slippers will never come off, as long as...
Oh! Well....
The little people who live in this land it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear. It's all right you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now you may all come out.
No that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Oh, very good, but very mysterious. He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
Well, then, you'll have to walk. The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland. And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
It's always best to start at the beginning and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
I have?
Oh, now?
Oh, dear that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's it's going to be so hard to say goodbye. I love you all, too. Goodbye, Tin Man. Oh, don't cry. You'll rust so dreadfully. Here here's your oil can. Goodbye.
Professor Marvel never guesses he knows! Now, why are you running away?
No, no now don't tell me. They they don't understand you at home. They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands big cities big mountains big oceans
Oh
Aw, come, come, come
Oh
Do you know any? Oh, you mean the thing Yes, well, I I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
Her her name is Emily.
Oh
Me?
What's she doing now?
That's all the Crystal's gone dark.
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
Oil can....
No it feels wonderful. I've held that axe up for ages. Oh
Oh well, about a year ago I was chopping that tree minding my own business when suddenly it started to rain....
My... my neck. My... my neck. Perfect? Oh bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect. Go ahead bang on it!
Oh, dear That was wonderful! You know we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Ohh what's that? Oh
I I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh I'll get it!
Oh oh
It it it it it's a huge one!
Well, of course not. My goodness, what a fuss you're making. Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess Be a lion not a mou ess If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin'I'm just a dande lion A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard
Supposin'you met an elephant?
I'd sooner wait outside.
Because I'm still scared!
Ohh!
Oh
I'd like to roar'em down But I think I lost my roarer.
Lion, darling I knew you'd come!
Oh, that's very kind of you but this could never be like Kansas. Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now. Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
Well, why don't you use them? When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place. Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble. See?
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Oh, that's very kind of you very kind.
Ohh!
Oh, no I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
My, it's good to be....
Did I scare you?
Um hmm.
That's where I live. And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Um hmm.
I couldn't say. But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
But maybe you'd better not. I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
I don't blame you for that.
Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.
To Oz!
Yes. Oh look
The other side....
Do do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
Oh and I was so happy! I thought I was on my way home!
Help! I'm burning! I'm burning! I'm burning! Help! Help! Help!
You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,....
Very well I'll bide my time and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
Dorothy next!
I don't know.
Oh, you did it yourself!
Here Come on.
And you're going to lead us.
Yes, you.
That's right.
Oh, scared, huh?
That doesn't do any good I'm afraid of'em.
Whozat?
Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
To Oz?
Emerald City!
Let's.
Oh now look at him! This is terrible!
It's no use screaming at a time like this! Nobody will hear you! Help!
You know something?
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Oh, dear, dear.
Come on, fellows!
Yeah
Yes.
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man?
And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Yes....
Oh! Help me! The balloon's going up!
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I  ve heard them all.
The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we weren  t around, they  d have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
Bond
Alright then, brunch.
It  s a bomb alright. We  re still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
What the hell are you talking about?
Who  s she?
Elektra King? Are you insane? This is her pipeline.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
Made to look just like an accident.
The King pipeline.
Count to twenty. I  ll be there.
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
And now it  s up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought.
You haven  t been given an assignment in this case.
I  m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
Claude Serrault. A. K. A...
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I  d do the same again.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
They  re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons? I can  t help thinking... the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
Is maybe... the inside woman.
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
Your last chance. Take the money.
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
Consider me ungrateful.
She  ll get over it.
A word? I  m sure by now he  s engineered a hostile takeover.
He died before he could complete his lifelong dream. I intend to finish it for him.
I haven  t been able to recall a single moment of that day... until now.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don  t want to talk to those people. I just want to... talk to my father. I loved him. I  m not sure he knew that.
Partially, yes.
How long has he been with you?
If you  ve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you. I have two bodyguards, I don  t need a third...
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King  s daughter.
You don  t take no for an answer, do you?
Then take me with you.
I don  t want to be safe!
What are you talking about?
... what?
I don  t know what you  re talking about!
You knew. You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
Just like you... only you were even easier.
You, of course. I need some information.
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world. A nice little rat  s nest.
What? This is not possible.
Off a high powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
Ah, I see. A purely... plutonic relationship.
I thought you were the one in her business.
As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
No. The truth! She thought I was dead those blades were meant for you. What do you know that she would kill you for?
A special job. A... a... a submarine.
This is too big for even you. Where is it?
Istanbul.
I  d heard there were some renovations there... no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
C class.
Is nothing. His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.
Who? Bond? Bond is dead.
Marvellous.
Where it can do the most damage.
Why? What's the problem?
I would like to use the bathroom
Please.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability... may depend on a quirk of the weather.
No idea who's behind this?
They want in. Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
Walter you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
There's no right or wrong. But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you. I want to help you. I want to know all about you.
We don't know that.
It's he's got some kind of conspiracy theory. He thinks someone's... I don't know, stalking us.
He's bound to get caught. I don't want my name coming out. Not at this late date.
No. I just wanted you to
Good night.
She's with me.
Thanks for the offer, Adrian. I'll let you know.
Uh huh. You might recognize the names. Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
It's not on tape. It's live. We're watching it happen.
It's a tachyon chamber. It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time. There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines existing parallel to our own
I've seen them! I've seen them in there.
I  m not.
Then I  ve been a very bad boy and you  ll have to spank me. Christ! I  m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
We'd better hope so. It's almost time.
Psychotic pig. He had it coming. Mr. CTU...
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit? It's a fucking Gestapo! Dirty tricks political assassinations
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Hey. You remember that nut in the hockey mask? With the asthma? What was his name...
That's the one. Whatever happened to him?
You'll find something. I should go. You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together...
Dan, what are you so scared of? I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel I feel glad. I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and
You're sure?
I'm not his... whatever. Okay?
Play one. Educate yourself.
I don't mind getting older. I'm obsolete anyway. Why try to hide it?
Old?
... What?
Laurie
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat. He invited us to come along. I've been thinking. If things do get nasty... it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
You and me.
Don't look. Turn around.
Oh, Laurie. Jesus. No.
They're practically on us...
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on. Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore. The world's about to end. I feel like I could save it.
... What??
My God! We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a
Everything's changed
We'll tell them what's happened. They'll listen to reason, won't they?
What new information?
Obvious pattern all ties in
Cases, leads they don't matter, Rorschach. The world's about to end. If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
What caused it?
Adrian you? You killed Blake, and
Anything for science, I guess. Janey, there's something
Nothing. What were you going to say?
My dad's a watchmaker. I'll put it back together for you. Better than ever.
No. No. Cut. Justine, we agreed. No questions about the Watchmen.
No. We laid out very careful ground rules
I did not. Now get out of my way!
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
You're not " protecting " anyone. These people's lives may depend on the answers you give. These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan
Six to eight months. That's with treatment. Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your... friends.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please. Let's move it.
Oh, I am, honey. You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute. And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit because our number one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
That's right. Your meal ticket's flown the coop. That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
He's in by the superaccelerator. Let me take your coat.
Please.
Laurie he's the most powerful man who's ever lived. He's changed the world.
What about you?
I'm sorry about Blake.
You're making a big
CTU? Jesus. You don't think
Too important for telephone. Comedian Dr. Manhattan. All linked up.
Fate of the world at stake, Adrian. Can't get too worked up over bad press.
What is this place?
Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a " salesman " over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a " trucker ", who happens to be packing a cop issue H  K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I " walked " in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. " Many are called, few are chosen ", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
Why is that?
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.
Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
What do I get out of it?
You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop along.
Yeah, I spy or I die.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this " Ahab ".
I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that " classified " stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song " Silent Night " mean anything to you?
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill.
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard.
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
What are you gonna do? They're Euro trash.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Like what?
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
You do everything Yorgi says?
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
I was invited. What's your story?
That right? Why's that?
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?
Go to hell!
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
What's that?
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
Aren't you afraid?
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me. I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
Let's do this.
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Viktor! Stay the course.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
You're joking, right?
I can see that. Why?
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
You're serious?
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
Who you workin'for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?
I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house.
I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about'em, who does?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
And here I thought " anarchy " was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
Storm. Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island. It is my feeling that Magneto has to
Yes Only there's a problem. The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature. It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to. The Senator's body is literally burning itself out. Scott this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
What are you talking about?
If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
I'll tell you one thing though.
He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon sized hole through him.
Uh huh.
Storm, Rogue, you take the south entrance. Jean and I will go in here.
Shut up. I got no interest in you, Xavier, or your... X Men.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
I'll see what I can do You should get some sleep. Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
If necessary.
What do you say?
He takes himself seriously.
Yeah, I'll bet you have.
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Tell it to the ones that did this to me.
You mutant bastards...
Come with me and I'll let her live.
Who?
I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
How?
He helped you?
Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.
What did she do to me?
I felt like she almost killed me.
And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles. And this one gets a front row seat.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
... No!
What?
All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
MMMMM! MMMMM!
Love me oodles and oodles?
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Surprised?
Miss me?
You have your tickets?
And your passport?
Call me from New York before you leave??
Promise??
Oh, darling I'll count the hours that you're away.
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
I hope you like large weddings.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends... but it still comes to three thousand.
Does that mean you love me?
Love me?
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
Why does he call you'master'?
All right then!
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck. Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
I suppose you're right.
Oh, darling! Don't let's spoil everything.
That's a tough choice.
I suppose you're right.
Are you putting me on?
And do you also say Fro dereck?
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
I see.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
This is Inga. They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
There wolf! There castle!
I thought you wanted to.
The wockers with the knockers.
Go ahead, play dumb! You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
What are you doing here?
Did you hear that strange music?
Did you hear that strange music??
Did you hear that strange music?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Funny it should just be lying out here on the table. I wonder what kind of dribble this is?
How?
I want that brain.
Was he any good??? He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
That's not bad.
I'm getting excited just thinking about it. What if he's not there?
Oh! May I call you'Master'?
It's always been one of my favorite names.
Thank you, Master.
Yes, master. Just don't turn on any radios.
Yes! When I give the word throw the first switch!
More, do you hear me?
Throw the third switch!
To you! You just made a'yummy'sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
But you did I just heard it.
But don't you see... the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk pleading with us. I've got to untie it.
Yes.
Why?
No, no! That whole thing!
Yes, Master!
Someone was playing this in the music room.
All right where is she?
Bring me the violin!
Maybe... if you get here on time.
He's carrying her off now through the woods.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
There's only one way.
Yes, master. Are you sure you want to go through with it?
Okay, boss! But I hope you know what you're doing.
How's everything?
I'm going to untie you can you understand that?
Yes, I'm going to set you free. Is the sedative ready?
Poo tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Soo pah doo per.
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while? I just can't sleep.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away. It must be the strange room.
Oh please just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
Inga, wake up!
Listen! Don't you hear that strange music?
I don't know. It just woke me up.
Let me come with you, Doctor, please! I don't want to stay up here alone.
But who was playing it?
' Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals. '
A god?
I know.
Oh! Yes, Doctor.
I don't understand I followed the notes to the letter.
Alive! Look at it. I have defeated death!
Yes quickly, dear!
It's some thing dar ing,'The Con ti nen tal,'A way of danc ing that's real ly ul tra new; It's ver y sub tle,'The Con ti nen tal. '
Give him the sedative!
Good! It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
Oh, a little. But it's not just physical loneliness. It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
I know, but I mean not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
Nor to Elizabeth.
We all have our feelings. I know that I have mine. And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
But, after all, you have yours.
Well...... perhaps for a few minutes.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I will.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
I love it when you're excited. Come then, my Apfelstrudel! Come into my arms and let me hold you.
Whew! A nineteen inch drill.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Three minutes to go!
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Do you have a reservation?
I'm sorry, sir. We only seat by reservation.
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there.
