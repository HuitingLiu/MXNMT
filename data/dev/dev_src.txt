I was six years old!
It was a small house.
Time.
Are you okay?
I m all right.
What picture?
Me?
No weirder than a sharp, young, good looking woman working in a lumberyard.
Most women wouldn t choose it.
I m just quiet.
Neither do you.
What?
I ll buy a plant.
K through sixth.
I like the noise.
You must hate it.
What about them?
What?
I get that impression.
Why do you want to know?
What?
You re still here.
Of course. Sorry. I m such a fucking asshole.
You think I have a problem?
It s been a while since...
Maybe later.
The morning?
What for?
I suffer from insomnia.
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
The worst?
I molested little girls.
What did you do to them?
How young?
Twelve years in prison?
I told you I m not easily shocked.
What?
Hey, I m not
You don t really
No. Prison is time. That s it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn t beat to live, it just beats... time.
Sounds like a special guy.
Their power. They seduce me.
I was always the one seduced.
No. That s what I used to tell myself.
Nothing. It s over.
What?
I know.
What odds?
Well, most people are stupid. You want to talk about odds? One day I ll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
Which brother did this?
You must hate your brothers.
No you don t.
You never asked them about it?
Not ever?
What?
I m not scared.
Live together.
Just think about it.
Who doesn t?
Guess that makes you pretty special.
I m not scared.
Do what?
What s your fucking problem?
Do you want to talk about it?
Yeah.
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months. I m tool pusher and we re testing this automated derrick of hers. So, we get back on the beach and... we re living together.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests. If you were married you got a state room. Otherwise it was bunks.
It was alright for a while, you know. But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
I... they re all dead, Bud. They re all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
Hi, Lins. I thought you were in Houston.
Wasn t up to me.
Your rig?
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it. So as long as they re hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
I m switching off now.
Not even when it meant something. Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
I was worried about the rig. I ve got over four years invested in this project.
Yeah, what s his name wouldn t like it. The Suit.
No, I haven t seen him in a few weeks.
Bud, why are you doing this? It s not part of you life any more.
No. Look, forget it. I don t want to talk about it.
I don t know what I saw. Okay? Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine. It s a Russian submersible. No problem.
No.
His mixture got screwed up. He panicked and pranged his regulator.
What do you think he saw?
Thanks. No, I can handle it. Bud... there won t be enough to run the heaters. In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
Brace yourself. We ve got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we re not using.
If you say so. It could be anything.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
I saw something! I m not going to go back there and say I didn t see it when I did. I m sorry.
I need you to believe me, Bud. Look at me. Do I seem stressed out? Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
How can I go on a feeling? You think Coffey s going to go on you feeling?
Bud, that water s only a couple degrees above freezing.
Not good enough. We still gotta catch Big Geek.
They ll come out after us.
How?
We ve only got one suit.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden? You got it on, keep it on.
NO!! Now be logical, Bud, you re
What s the plan?
Hi, lady.
' Course is worked. You re never wrong, are you? How d you feel.
I can t afford slack, Brigman.
God, I hate that bitch.
Hippy, you think everything s a conspiracy.
That s it then. Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry. Jesus.
Why bring it here?
Got it. Over.
Yeah! I mean, I don t know... it looks right.
Yuh?
Couldn t stay away. You running mixture for us? Good. Couldn t ask for better.
We ve been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Neutron counter s not showing very much.
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving. We re on a tight timeline.
How many are there?
You don t need to know the details of this mission... you re better off if you don t.
What s you depth, Cab Three?
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain t gonna be fancy. When he gets down there he ll just sit, like a dumb shit. Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you ll get nada.
How deep?
Ask him a pressure effects. Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
I don t know... It depends on Ettore... He s now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
You ll get over it soon. It s the usual anxiety.
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later. We ll get married soon. That way we ll have more time...
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn t I that enough?
But you just said that a month was too...
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn t you have any feeling for me, even then?
I m thirsty.
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things... instead, I fell asleep.
This one is gorgeous.
I m certainly not going to swim across.
Four or five days.
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
Because it s true. After thirty years not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
You already know what they are.
That must be Basiluzzo.
At what?
Well, what?
More so than the shark?
Maybe you d better ask him.
How should I be... arrogant?
And why haven t they left each other?
And why do you tell us this only now?
I m sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
Yes, very much so.
Occasionally, but always with affection.
Yes.
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
I don t know why. I just couldn t help it.
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It s idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she s not...
I m sorry. I didn t want to sound cynical. But isn t it better to look things squarely in the eye?
It takes even less.
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
And what about you?
Are you joking?
Oh, Sandro... I m so ashamed of myself, so ashamed... I tried to hide myself... I feel so small... I hate myself...
Oh no... It doesn t please me at all...
But just think the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
And why did you drop them?
I m sure you d be able to design some very lovely things.
What! Get married?
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don t know... I can t even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure... that you want to marry... me?
Hurry up now, or it ll begin to get hot outside...
Why?
I was only joking, really... Can t I make a joke? And now you ve got to tell me why you don t want to.
Yes, she started to but I didn t feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
Aren t you going to change?
Why?
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
Tell me once more.
I would say he s pretty depraved.
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
To do what?
You say that just to flatter me.
What do you mean by sensible?
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don t even cry, I m afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one s self of pain and suffering.
But for what reason should I come there?
There s a shark in the area. Don t move from where you are!
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I m sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say " how beautiful " to everything whether it s the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn t care about me any more.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
What do you think?
There too...
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
What is it?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Giulia, don t you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
And where do you find the models?
But how could they pose like that? I couldn t.
Answer me, why don t you try posing? I ll paint you a beautiful portrait.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
Unfortunately, no.
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you ll need some rope and ladders...
Another thing; there s an old man who lives here on the island...
And do you remember where she got off?
There s the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don t know...
No. The owners are in Australia.
What boat?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
What do you want us to do? I don t know myself... But we ll do something.
They didn t seem too good.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
You know, I don t love anybody.
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
You re kidding!
Oh... I m sorry I have to rush but I ve got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
Is that possible?
Is that far from here?
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It s the local Palermo paper, isn t it?... I mean, it s widely read...
You really must do me this one favor.
No I don t.
That wasn t me.
Hasn t anyone ever told you that before?
What would you like to talk about.
Anything... may I sit down?
God! But there s nothing to say about God.
Love.
Yes.
Everyone.
Right now?
I love you.
Yes.
Oh, there are so many.
Oh, yes!
Oh, I know he does.
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
Yes.
At least once a week.
Oh, yes.
Would you like to talk about it?
Why should they?
Do you remember the night they said it came?
How were you sick?
Did it hurt?
Where?
And what did you do?
And what happened?
And then what?
In the middle of all the pain?
Where did the baby come from?
The baby they made up.
Is that where they say it came from...?
Where d it come from before that?
After God... before the waste paper basket.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Yes I do, but I want you to...
Then let s talk about something else...
Agnes...
Would you like to ask them?
Just that... you ask and I ll answer.
Martha Louise Livingston.
No.
Not at the moment, no.
No.
I can t have them any more.
I ve stopped menstruating
Does it bother you?
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I ll become obsessed with something else, then I ll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don t know.
No... do you?
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
Oh, they frighten me, I m afraid I ll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that s why I don t understand things.
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
I hope not. It s a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Where did you go?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn t stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That s why she hid me away.
Somebody told her.
I don t know.
You ll laugh.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
No.
No.
No, but I can never tell her that.
Yes.
I could never be a mother.
Well I don t think I m old enough and besides I don t want to have a baby.
Because I don t want one.
From someone who didn t want to have a baby.
A mistake...
A mistake... it was a mistake...
If you re trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn t want me but that s not true, she was a good woman, a saint...
I can t help it if I m stupid.
Not my fault.
I was a mistake.
Everything... I don t have children.
I m not sick.
That s because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I ll forget.
Everyone s unhappy, you re unhappy aren t you?
Answer me! You never answer me.
I m always bad.
No...
I can t.
Yes.
She can.
She watches... she listens.
She...
... makes me...
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
Yes.
Yes.
She says my whole body s a mistake.
Because she says if I don t watch out I ll have a baby.
Her headaches.
And then...
She touches me down there with a cigarette. Please Mommy, don t touch me like that any more. I ll be good, I won t be a baby any more.
I m afraid.
Alright.
No I m not.
Yes.
No I m not.
Yes I am.
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
As much as Mother Miriam does?
Yes.
Doctor Livingston.
To help me.
Because I m in trouble.
Of what?
But it s easy. It s just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
It came out of me.
Yes.
No.
Because I was afraid.
Because I wasn t worthy.
Yes.
May I open my eyes now?
It grew.
Yes.
No.
I can t tell you that.
She made me promise not to.
I m afraid.
I ate.
Fish...... brussel sprouts.
We went to chapel for vespers.
Someone s following me.
Sister Marguerite I think.
What else?
Above the bed? Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different? What is it?
Do you know who put it there?
What do you think it s there for?
Are you ill?
What do you feel?
What do you do?
I don t know which one
Of me. Oh... God! My God... Water... it s all water...
Go away, I don t want you here.
Frightened.
Yes.
Yes.
And the passage to the barn?
Why?
Who?
How did she know about him?
Where?
So she sent you?
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
He frightened you and he hurt you. It s not your fault. It s his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Agnes who did you see?
Of course you do. Who was it?
Yes.
Who?
It was alive wasn t it?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I put her to sleep.
Martha, all we re saying is, no one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
Why?
Marty, what are you doing here?
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
What? You think that the girl is innocent?
What s the matter with you, you ve seen the reports. It s a cut and dried case.
Why? You ve done nothing to show any progress.
You re getting to all of us Martha, let s face it.
It s gone on long enough. You re out.
You have proof?
When?
I can get you new evidence next week.
Shut up, I m trying to watch this.
Who are you?
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she s going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn t work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you d say Mama that ending was so sad... and I d tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood. And you believed me.
Who are you?
Well you re probably right about that. It certainly can t help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
Who told you this?
What business is it of yours..?
Look, Father, ah... just because I don t subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
I don t understand. Are you expecting me to..?
Hoop, this isn t a hoop, it s a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Well! A boy of your age bowling " hoop " at people. How old are you anyway?
Bet you re only eight and a half.
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
Shurrup!
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Y what?
Well that s lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren t you at school?
Are you now?
Just you?
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Yeah? And they re your mates are they?
Not much cop without em, is it?
Yeah?
How about Ding Dong?
I m a deserter, too.
I ll murder that Lennon.
They ll be here.
Well, that s the wrong line for a start.
Ah... a shamus, eh?
I ve made the scene.
You ve got an inferiority complex, you have.
No, she ll only reject me in the end and I ll be frustrated.
You do repeatedly.
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don t have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
Oh, by all means, I d be quite prepared for that eventuality.
Of course I can.
I ll have a bash.
Ta.
I wouldn t be seen dead in them. They re dead grotty.
Yeah, grotesque.
But I won t.
I don t care.
And who s this Susan when she s at home?
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T. V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
She s a drag. A well known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
Have I said something amiss?
It is, y know.
A butcher?
Now what s that supposed to mean?
No. I mean, it s probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
We do.
He hasn t.
Oh, I m sorry, I must have made a mistake.
Is he?
It s Paul s grandfather.
Well, what happened?
Well... go head, do the next bit.
I ve got you worried, haven t I?
D you know something, " They " don t worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you... that s all but if it worries you... well...
How d you guess?
Is it... is it, really?
Something like that.
Yeah... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl. Yeah, it s gear on a girl.
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
I m not...
No. I m a walk on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
Yes.
What s that mean?
The big hammer?
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
Aye well, actresses aren t like real people, are they?
Oh, I don t know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
I m in a group... well... there are four of us, we play and sing.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It s fab.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Why selfish?
Not really but I m probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Is she?
And you honestly think that s what she meant?
And cunning.
Me? Oh, I don t have the time, I m always running about with the lads... no, we don t have the time.
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it s all right, you know... bash on, happy valley s when they let you stop. Anyroad, I d better get back.
See you.
That s all right then.
Hiding.
What little old man?
Well... everyone s entitled to two, aren t they, and this is me other one.
No... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it ud give him a change of scenery, like.
He s got you worried, then?
Like what?
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he s back, isn t he? And it s not his fault he s old.
You needn t bother.
Practising to be thick headed, you re there already.
Of course, he s concealed about me person.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Ah, go on, you swine.
It s all right for you, you couldn t get a pen in your foot, you swine.
We were going to do it.
You wouldn t!
Tonight? We can t make it...
Now, look here, Norm...
What?
Hello.
No, not me.
No, I m not.
I m not, no.
Oh do I? You re the first one who ever said that.
Oh yes.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
I would have said so.
No I don t, he s only a casual acquaintance.
What have you heard?
Is it? Is it really?
I knew I could rely on you.
Oh, leave off!!!
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
Y what?
Don t exaggerate.
Don t worry about him. He can look after himself.
Aren t we...
But...
It s not my fault.
Who?
Oh, I didn t notice, where d he go?
Oh, down the... er...?
You re imagining it. You re letting things prey on your mind.
But John hasn t got any.
Nerves.
You can t trust you with anything, Norm, if you ve lost him, I ll cripple you.
I m an electrician, not a wet nurse, y know.
I ve got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he s done it.
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
Is that you, Roby?
Cattle ranch!
Hell, we re equipped
... I don t know...
Where the hell are we?
Yeah. Two hours.
What s the terrain down there?
Is it solid?
Then take her down.
Looks like a derelict.
Chaz, this is Dell. Can you come topside for a minute?
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind s died down. It s as clear as a bell outside. There s something I think you ought to see.
You want to try?
No, it s too small, only room enough for one person.
Yeah, I m okay. Haven t hit bottom yet. Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
Wretched. What happened to me?
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
What? Why?
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor
Hard to say.
Yeah!
What?
Jay, we ve got a problem. I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
The computer s translated the alien signal, and it s kind of alarming.
It grows on you.
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what? It s food now. You re eating it.
Dead.
It s monstrous it grew, like some horrible tapeworm. We were completely unprepared.
Don t know Broussard got hurt somehow.
Well... I m going to have to blow the engines out...
Oh I m not near ready yet.
What?
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship. That would kill it.
Meet us on the bridge. Be careful it s huge now.
No, I don t want us separated.
Right.
He s the only one that knows that.
Well, can t we kill it? I mean, we can t leave the damn thing on him.
But this thing uses it for blood.
Boy, that s terrific.
What do you mean?
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid? It s dead.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here? We can t grab it it might jump on us
How s Broussard?
Still unconscious?
Can you do anything for him?
Sounds like a rough one.
That s right we can t kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay and maybe drive it into the air lock.
Oh my God.
I don t buy that. There s still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
Good! That s good!
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
I ve completely lost their signal.
No.
We re not going anywhere.
We can t spare the personnel. We ve got minimum takeoff capability right now. That s why Chaz left us on board.
How many?
What is it I can t tell anything
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we ve been dealing with.
We can use the flamethrower.
Is it armed?
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
How far?
It ll yank him right off his feet if he s not expecting it. The line could get tangled in something.
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
What is it?
Yes, thank heaven.
Is it still dripping?
The commander normally has first publication rights.
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: " Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink. " All that space out there, and we re trapped in this ship.
We can t even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn t reach its destination till long after we d died and turned to dust. We are utterly, absolutely alone. Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances? Halfway across Creation...
Time and space have no meaning out here. We re living in Einsteinian equation.
We re the new pioneers, Chaz. We even have our own special diseases.
Are they close?
All right, then when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door. Okay?
That tube must be depositing it in him.
Yeah?
What s the matter, you don t like this stuff?
Chaz, I ve got something here on my security alert. A high priority from the computer...
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Good! Moisture content?
Any microorganisms?
Anything else?
Found what?
I agree. This is the single most important discovery in history.
I don t even know what I m looking for.
Oh well... you know me.
Well... it s obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it s a symbol that means something to them...
Yeah, we hear you! We re coming back!
We re coming up now, open the outer lock door.
Chaz, if it s an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
Chaz, listen to me we ve broken every rule of quarantine. If we bring an organism on board, we won t have a single layer of defense left.
Look, I m not trying to rub anybody s nose in anything. The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
You bet we made it. Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
We ll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
All right, so that s what we ve got. A week. It s plenty of time.
We ve got it up here! It s trapped! Get up here fast!
Food storage room!
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
Once we kill the thing we won t need the food any more we can go straight into hypersleep. Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
What s that supposed to mean?
Well... yes... there s a pattern... but it s meaningless to me.
Can we get to him?
At least we re rid of the damn monster. It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Okay. First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Yeah... I forgot.
And you ll let me know when you ve got it coming this way...
What did it do to you?
I ll get you out of there.
But I can save you get you to the Autodoc!
What can I do?
The head s okay, but I could sink a six pack.
It s nothing, Doc. Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Is it dead?
God, I hope that thing didn t bring down a virus.
Thanks.
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back trace just to make sure.
A three second burn to port, on my mark.
What s happening?
Comin up the Central Reservoir.
And?
Shit. When?
You win some, you loose some.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour. Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
The door s sealed from inside. Doc Revna s in there, and it sounds like Ackland s going nuts.
Has anybody talked to them?
About thirty minutes. Those are slimmed down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
One more sweep... one more sweep. I m getting tired of one more fuckin sweep. We re been lookin for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Yeah?
What?
Goldsmith s gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
What?
I ve seen this mother, De Vries. We can bag it, no problem.
C mon De Vries. Think of the bonus.
What?
What s wrong?
How?
It s alright, it s cool...
Okay.
Nah. It s got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation. Someone d have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
What s the problem?
Give me twenty minutes and I ll do it myself.
Have you got an updated Lloyds Almanac to cross reff them through?
Compensate!
Let s just run through it one more time so I know you ve got it straight.
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while. Clear my head.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Is that a fact.
How long you been out here for now, anyway? Three months?
And before that?
Only six?
Nothing. With the satellite down, we can t transmit over the mountain range. He s most likely sitting there wondering why he can t raise us.
' We? You wanna fly out there with me?
Do you think Ackland ll sit tight?
Agreed.
Ah, don t worry about I. C. C. They re the least of your problems right now.
What can I do?
I... I can t!
Yeah, exactly. Those re pre programmed course adjustments you re looking at.
You should hit the sack, too.
What time s sundown?
Give me a yell is something happens.
Miss Harrington s resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
It s a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
Phoebe.
I call myself Phoebe.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
You re more than kind. But it s still Miss Channing s performance. I m just a carbon copy you read when you can t find the original...
It s not modesty. I just don t try to kid myself.
Please do.
I don t think I ve done anything to sound off about.
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It ll be forgotten tomorrow.
Even if I wanted to as you say be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I m less than nobody.
I d love to! Or should I pretend I m busy?
I m not enough for a paragraph.
That s right.
Yes. I do.
Yes. The Shubert.
Eddie...
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We ll make this a special night...
Just some coffee.
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd and that he was interested.
Just like that.
It wasn t meant to be.
D day.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
All paved with diamonds and gold?
Paved with what, then?
Almost four.
You could sleep, too, couldn t you?
Why d call me a killer?
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish so he sent it up...
That s for tonight. You re invited. We re having everyone up after the performance.
She s always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her
Something about an old road ending and a new one starting paved with stars...
It s nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
I m in love with Lloyd!
You have no right to say such things!
... and Karen.
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
The setting wasn t romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door he couldn t sleep, he told me he s left Karen, he couldn t go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
I don t know what I take you for anything...
I m sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don t know what...
I never intended you to be.
It s important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
Not with me, you re no champion. You re stepping way up in class.
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary because you know as well as I, what I am about to say. Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd or anyone else because I will not permit it.
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
A dull cliche.
So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don t enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known have taken it for granted that you and I...
What of it?
She never proved anything, not a thing!
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
No no no...
Yes, Addison.
Yes, Addison.
You can have one at Max s.
Why not?
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it s going to be an elaborate party, and it s for you.
It s the same thing, isn t it?
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
Then you ve heard too.
You were there? At the play last night?
Margo.
It s new Margo. But she s just as late as the old one.
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
We have that in common.
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support moral or otherwise.
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Over? It can t be. I ve come to read with her. I promised Max.
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill? Lloyd? Well, it couldn t have been Max! Who?
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy
Eve! My understudy...
Of course I knew.
Frankly, I don t remember.
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
I take it she read well.
How nice.
A mass of music and fire. That s me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven t! I start shooting a week from Monday Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Huh?
Where?
Thank you so much.
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Like a nylon lemon peel
Eve. I d forgotten they grew that way...
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
I understand they ve got the Indians pretty well in hand...
Huh?
I ll try.
Everybody can t be Gregory Peck.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
And cut that out right now.
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
That I am...
When when are you coming back?
In a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
A big hurry, be quick about it so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
Bill, you know how much I do but over the phone, now really, that s kid stuff...
Sing it?
The reading could have been better, but you said it now " many happy returns of the day... "
I get a party, don t I?
It s no secret, I know all about the party Eve wrote me...
She hasn t missed a week since I left but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask check with her.
How is Eve? Okay?
I love you...
What?
Cut it out.
You ve heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
I thought you were going to be late
I had no idea you were even here.
That never stopped you before.
She s a girl of so many interests.
She s a girl of so many rare qualities.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
I don t think that s funny!
Twenty minutes!
Stage struck kid... she s a young lady of qualities. And I ll have you know I m fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
For instance you!
Guilty.
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
Nothing, really...
It hasn t been laid out, we haven t finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you re looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
What s all over?
Who?
Gone.
I wouldn t be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
Don t mix your metaphors.
Okay. Mix.
What a body, what a voice.
The gong rang. The fight s over. Calm down.
Don t calm down.
I m trying terribly hard.
Here we go...
Now don t get carried away
You ve been all through that with Lloyd
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
I didn t know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
That word again! I don t even know what it means...
I ve been aware of that for some time.
I ll say.
Come on, get up. I ll buy you a drink.
Margo, let s make peace.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve and Eve and me?
But if I tell you it is as I just did. Were you listening to me? Isn t that enough?
Then what would be enough? If we were married?
You ve had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what s behind all this.
Hear, hear...
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
What would you like? Texas?
You ve got it backwards. Even for Wilkes Barre.
Groom.
You know what I m going to be?
A married lady.
I just wondered.
Why.
Why you have to go out there.
Is it the money?
Then why? Why, if you re the best and most successful young director in the Theater
I just asked a simple question.
It s only one picture deal.
Also Addison deWitt.
I have a suggestion. There s really not much time left I mean, you haven t had a minute alone yet, and well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you d like.
Are you proud of me, Bill?
You shouldn t have had any doubts.
Is that what you want me to be?
So am I.
Everything.
From what would I be running?
I m for it.
When I told you what every young actress should know.
Your make up s a little heavy.
You re quite a girl.
I m in love with Margo. Hadn t you heard?
I m only human, rumors to the contrary. And I m as curious as the next man...
But she just got here...
What did you expect live sables?
Buy some.
Of course!
Oh, brother.
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
Behind in your dues? How much?
Well?
Oh oh.
Hmm?
Do you want an argument or an answer?
No.
Now you want an argument.
Night an day.
Like an agent with one client.
Well... let s say she thinks only about you, anyway...
My back s open. Did the extra help get here?
You re not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn t he?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests. They re domestic, too, and they don t care what they drink as long as it burns... where s Bill? He s late.
Don t be dense. The party.
Miss Harrington...
How did you get in here?
You were just looking around...
What for?
Probably not.
What report? To whom?
I ve heard of them.
Erasmus Hall. That s in Brooklyn, isn t it?
I might.
I ll just pick up the broken glass.
Subway.
Why should you think I wouldn t be?
I hope you don t mind my speaking to you...
I ve seen you so often it took every bit of courage I could raise
You re Margo Channing s best friend. You and your husband are always with her and Mr. Sampson... what s he like?
He s the best.
Oh, no. I see the play.
Oh, no...
But if I d known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
Try...
I ll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Hollywood.
Karen.
Nobody s done so much, Eve, you ve got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
I don t let myself think about it, even but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there d be no need to break in a new girl but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn t possibly...
The show must go on.
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson
Of course.
I won t forget.
But there must be some reason, something I ve done without knowing...
If I thought I d offended her, of all people
Don t bother, I can take it up myself...
They certainly don t waste much time.
Don t get up. And don t act as if I were the queen mother.
I don t intend to be.
There can t be very much
And easy or not, I won t believe a word.
And you felt just like that talking to Addison.
Do you expect me to believe that you didn t say any of those things that they were all Addison?
Let s not get over dramatic.
I m not crying.
Some vague promises of a test, that s all if a particular part should come along, one of those things
An understudy s performance.
He s not my friend. You were my friends...
I ll never get over it.
I wish I could believe that.
Something most important you can do.
If you told him so, he d give me the part. He said he would.
It could have been fifteen years ago. It s my part now.
" Cora " is my part. You ve got to tell Lloyd it s for me.
Over my dead body...
Every performance? Then am I safe in assuming you like it?
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. Footsteps on the Ceiling.
Not at all...
There are other plays...
Well if I m not in the way...
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time
You certainly can. Especially if you re me between now and tomorrow morning...
Well, teacher s away and actors will be actors...
Well, you ve done so much... what s new?
Don t bother. Mrs. Brown ll be along for it in a minute.
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too too " Seventeenish " for me...
There s the script to go back to the Guild
And those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
It seems I can t think of a thing you haven t thought of...
Eve...... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
Yes, I guess you were. It it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we re on the subject, will you check about the hors d oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn t dry or something...
Hello, Miss Channing.
Really, Eve? Why?
Why not?
It s just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about
Yes, it is! You re talented, famous, wealthy people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
They re your fans, your audience
You ve what?
Harrington.
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet
Roughly ten minutes.
Three or four miles...
None in sight, there aren t many along this back road...
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
It doesn t matter.
We ve all seemed a little tense lately...
We re never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
You re Margo. Just Margo.
What about Bill?
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can t tell they apart how can he?
Bill s in love with Margo Channing. He s fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what s left will be... what?
Those years stretch as the years go on. I ve seen it happen too often.
Well...
About what?
I just can t believe it.
Lloyd says it s a publicity release...
With tears.
Check.
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so packed houses, tickets for months in advance I can t see that either of Lloyd s last two plays have hurt you any!
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
Up to here! That s where I ve got it up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with
Then a childish, heavy handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part! Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She s got everything a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant
Everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
What is?
When you asked a minute ago it was five forty two. It is now five forty three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be
I guess I didn t look. You know I don t pay attention to those things...
What a way to die trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
Where d you get all that information?
Eve?
That was a pity...
That s quite a change of subject.
I m trying hard to follow you.
I m beginning to catch up.
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who d look the part as well as play it?
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
With gestures, of course.
Now just a minute
Now just a minute!
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy of Dramatic Arts!
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn t be more surprised if she d said Grant s Tomb.
Such as?
I m a human being, I ve got some!
Old wives tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
That was way back...
Where is she?
Too many. And you ve got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
The play? All right, I guess...
Twentyish. It isn t important.
How do you mean?
Margo, you haven t got any age.
I know what I m talking about, after all they re my plays...
Week after week, to thousands of people, you re as young as you want...
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
You d have been proud of her.
She was a revelation...
What do you mean?
That s beside the point.
In this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything rat!
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I m lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately as if it were Holy Gospel!
Usually at the point when she s got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
I have no intention of having an accident!
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
You know, she probably means well, after all...
I mean really, deeply angry...
What s your being married got to do with it?
I just played it.
But that was the fourth straight time.
No. You re just crazy about " Liebestraum. "
Look, Miss Channing... it s kind of depressing. If you don t mind my saying so, everybody s kind of dying on the vine...
The situation I m in ain t the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
I feel right now like there s one burning in me.
A couple of weeks.
Would you?
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
All you got to do is name it.
Margo, I wouldn t think of taking that girl away from you...
But what could she do?
Well...
I don t know if this would be a wise move...
I promise.
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
Answer my question!
I didn t hear you.
I sure couldn t hurt it, could I?
It was bullshit the way it was
What have you been here, nine months? I been in this business since I was sixteen
You only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale
They re all the same, all those Ivy League places they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you re smart
Mine s better
Yeah?
It s OK; I m sorry I called you a failure.
Let me lay a little theory on you
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air conditioning system.
What, though? It can t be the Republicans he d never allow something as stupid as this, not when he s gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
Hmm.
Hunt doesn t seem like your ordinary consultant.
A spy, you mean?
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
See?
Fifteen phone calls
Why didn t we get that?
For the paper, no; for us, plenty. I waited a long time and finally this big guy I guess a bodyguard he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
She was panicked, Carl every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
You re not a kid anymore.
I never scared anyone before.
Facts or theory?
We know there s got to be something or they wouldn t be so panicked.
You believe in the President, you wouldn t ever want to do anything disloyal.
Sure.
When?
Go on, go on
Then tomorrow s grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
We will
You mean, who s going to play the mean M. P. and who s going to be the nice one? Whichever.
You want me to be the bastard.
The lookout in the Motor Inn? he say anything we don t know?
Shit
I know, I know
Shit, who do we know?
Has he got an ax?
I haven t said anything
How high up, which Republicans?
Haldeman I know, who else?
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
So maybe Watergate wasn t really about Watergate maybe that was just a piece
It makes a crazy kind of sense remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President s staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach
Who?
What if I went up and introduced myself think he d slug me?
It s nothing personal, though.
Same as Magruder, I don t like it when they turn out to be human.
Deep Throat won t confirm I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he s scared of Haldeman.
Hmm?
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that
Fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats
According to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971
Almost a year before he left the Justice Department
To become President Nixon s campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund
Sir, I d like to ask you a few
11: 30.
Night.
Listen, I ve got a dinner can t we do this tomorrow?
The telephone calls... we know about that.
Howard Hunt?
Any idea what he did?
Teddy Kennedy?
I m so glad.
And you will. But not now.
Well of course.
You can t.
I ve got a lot of energy.
They never told me anything except my own role I had to find out the rest in the papers.
I know where Dwight works.
I didn t do anything wrong.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe off the record.
I didn t.
Chapin did contact you then?
On the orders of Haldeman?
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he s gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he s gotten the OK from the President.
So?
That was awhile ago
There s nothing new in it
Absolutely
Where are your bills, Carl?
Lot of pressure at the Star. Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this. How much did the damn bike cost?
You re two months behind you got enough to cover?
Give me your checkbook then.
There s always a later plane.
Anyplace really public, they d know about it they know everything at the Committee, Carl
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D. A. to tell the things the FBI didn t ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she d done. They control everything; that s how they know it all.
You don t believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
I don t know what they d do to me.
' Cause I m not calling out from the phone company anymore I think the place is bugged.
What do you want to know?
My big civil rights buddy boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming. What re you onto?
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
It was accurate, but I can t get a fuller listing for you all Barker s phone records have been subpoenaed.
A Miami D. A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis.
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
To cover up?
I will not talk about the other two.
This ll only take one second
How senior?
I don t know titles.
His dialing finger must be falling off
I m not here.
Look, I told you inside
I assure you, there s nothing mysterious involved.
So?
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
You re a lawyer and you re here
A Miami social occasion? Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
It was really nice of you to come, since you d only met him once.
I have nothing more to say.
Absolutely Marilyn s gotten it totally wrong
That s a bullshit question, that s a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
Where? What do you mean, where?
... check...?
... you re definitely doing a story...?
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
Howard Hunt here.
Yes, yes, what is it?
James McCord.
Security consultant.
Government. Recently retired.
... Central... Intelligence... Agency...
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
That s everything Bachinski had, I think it s worth following up.
I did all right on McCord.
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
You can t believe that.
Lotsa hints
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, " I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who s this yokel Stalin? "
Thanks, Harry. Know anything about Colson?
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt s duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
Woodward s onto a new wrinkle with the break in thing absolute page one stuff
Could develop.
Anyone but Bernstein.
Remember Toronto, Harry.
I don t get it you were the one who wanted to fire him.
Harry, weren t you just arguing the opposite way?
Maybe to fire you since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent? And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I m not saying she s going on relief, but I don t think it s unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
Well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee s not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don t think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
When so ordered.
Haldeman. Right?
One thing I m not completely clear on when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly dead insane chick. Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
Finch! Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
Easy, tiger. What s in there?
Why is this?
Charming.
Really? Hey, thanks Heather, right?
Yeah. Right, uh huh. I feel like I ve discovered this whole new side of me. Music is so expressive.
Of course, I didn t
Well the same things you do. Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever. What do you think I do?
You can call me Oz.
You can call me Ostreicher.
Forget it.
Neither will I.
I m glad you think so.
Oh, please. I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with. But you are just a jock. No wait. You re a jerk.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Because I want to.
How did you know I was here?
You talked to Stifler?
Really? Cool. Tell him his subs are great.
That s nice.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern. I didn t want to write all those extra essays they make you do I mean, how am I supposed to know what my " most emotionally significant moment " was? So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
What?
Oh, yeah. So what re you gonna major in?
Yeah. So wow, you ve got it figured out.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Yeah. You know, people are always like, " What re you gonna major in? " And I don t know. And they re like, " You ll figure it out. " Yeah? When?
You oh, you mean yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
You can t sing at the competition.
... it s okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
I m not playing.
What s that?
No, that s not what I mean. I mean look. You know what made me leave that game? Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
You called me Oz.
Yeah right.
Yeah but, no offense, you re talking about a post high school, long distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven t even done it yet.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for? Milk and cookies?
Vicky, it s not a space shuttle launch, it s sex. So did you do the physics write up?
Of course he does. What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin or have you never had one, period?
Well that s a no. No wonder you re not psyched about sex. You ve never even had one manually?
What?
You mean... and orgasm?
Well... I m pretty sure I ve
But that one time
Well of course I d want to give her that. I mean, what do you think, I don t care about her?
Of course.
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her. That s how I was duped.
No comment?! Are you kidding me?! I ve never seen someone s image change so... so drastically!
Did you guys hook up or something?
Then what the hell are you talking about?
I don t get it, that really works?
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
You can crash at Stifler s?
Pontificated.
Right. That gives us...
No it s true. He is... really... big.
Went home to shit.
Well... dammit, if I m doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Anything! Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
No, you re stupid. Get going! Right now! She s primed!
My date s a flute toting band dork. That answer your question?
Yeah, sure.
Do you know about the clitoris?
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Sure you know, son, but I think you ve been having a little problem with it. It s okay, though. What you re doing is perfectly normal. It s like practice. Like when you play tennis against a wall. Some day, there ll be a partner returning the ball. You do want a partner, don t you son?
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He s a good little kid. Er, guy. Man.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
I thought so. Because, one time? I was at this
Michelle.
Really? You seriously want to go with me?
Are we going to Steve Stifler s party afterwards? That would be so cool.
It reminds me of this one time Hey, can I ask you a question? How come you don t have any stories? I ve got lots of stories, and you don t have any.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff? Tell me.
I told you.
Yes! And he was such a dork! And everyone laughed at me, but I didn t care? Because it was so funny!
Now, I have two rubbers. Wear them both, it ll desensitize you. I don t want you coming so damn early.
Don t you want me to?
Yeah hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night? That Ariel, whew.
Yeah, Oz, but not when she s on land.
A hot cartoon.
Hang in there, buddy, you ll get there.
After getting laid?
Hey Sherman. Scopin the babes.
You ve got something going?
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards. I can change clothes at your place?
Well... uh...
Uh... yeah... sorry.
Strip?
Move with the music.
Nadia, I can t
Yes... James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
I am sorry, Jim. I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
God dammit, Stifler!
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Kevin, this is serious!
Vicky do you think, maybe... it s time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
I think " shithead " really says it.
No, I m not. I m writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I m doing the extra credit problems. Mr. Bender doesn t bother to check homework past April.
Yeah, we have. You corrupted my four point into a three nine five.
Well, I feel that... things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share... a special moment between them.
You want to do it?
No, I don t not love you. I like, I know that we ve definitely got something between us. Something good. Something special.
I know, Vick. I m just not ready yet, okay?
Did you know that it s... 450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Yeah, are you?
Yeah. Are you sure?
Me too.
I don t know. How do you?
I want to hear you say it.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Don t say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but
I know. Let s go. Don t you have something to tell your friends?
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
I m such a loser.
Dude, prom sucks.
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Nah, gave her the Heisman. I m working on something new.
Dude, it s gotta happen she s a college chick!
She works part time at my dad s store.
Keep it down, dude.
Well, just don t expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
I d use pills. They re painless.
Just like sex with my wife.
Also like sex with my wife.
Hope I didn t hurt him too bad.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
A duh... You re a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Yeah, that s the word. And you are?
It s a fucking nightmare, isn t it?
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can t find shit.
What?
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
Fine. My mistake. You know, I m gonna be a writer myself some day.
It s nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it s, uh...
Yes. It s a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that s supposed to be mild, I don t want to know about medium. The planet earth. It s good to be back.
Go to Jim Morrison s grave at Pere Lachaise. It s overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
So s Woody Allen. No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes. You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they re serious about it. Totally dedicated.
Professor Roussel. There s something wrong with you. I know it.
Are you okay?
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I know. He told me.
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what s left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He s a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
I didn t know he had a wine cellar.
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin hors d oeuvre? Huh?
What...?
Where?
What?
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Well, they are French.
You on drugs? Huh?
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We re not alone
Man, I don t know what the fuck you re talking about.
My uncle s in a coma you moron!
Or else what? You ll kill me?
Bullshit! You re bluffing!
Oh shit... No...
But... I don t remember anything, I swear...
What about me?
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it s dangerous
You think it s silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
He s on a new drug called ZBH, or " Daydream ". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he s dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
Yeah?
It s chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today s technology it s possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
Andy? Andy is that you?
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
Yeah, I finally " checked out ", thank God. But there s a bit of unfinished business.
How well did, er, do you know him?
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that s all we know...
Well, here s what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he s making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
I can t believe this. Why don t you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
I don t know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Don t worry. In a few seconds you won t feel a thing.
I m telling you. It s not drugs. It s something more. Someth
I can t! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It s crazy!
Serafine? Is that you? What s going on?
You fucking liar!
Okay. So maybe you were right.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
I was showing Sonya something...
How to read.
But what if we can t ever find where we came from?!
Well, I don t have any money...
Who s Sophie?
Come out! I can do alterations.
I shant!
Yes, your highness.
Yes, your highness.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You re my friend!
I m sorry... I m...
What happened to your parents?
You know, it s strange Anastasia s grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution. Why do you think she wouldn t go to her own grandmother?
I have my reasons.
Sorry it s a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you you automatically come up swinging.
Now just get off the train.
It s the best fork of all
Sad?
Yeah... well, yours. You still don t believe that you re the Princess, do you?
Well, the only thing you ve got when you ve got a home is a fear of losing it! You re lucky you don t remember the revolution I never had much, but what I did have I lost.
Yes If I can t convince Sophie, I ll never be able to see Tatiana....
Tell me it isn t true?! Tell me you didn t do this for the money!
No, it wasn t a bat! I saw this horrible man I remember him, I think...
Oh, yes, Grandmama I wait until I hear...
You ll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
You can t go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
Oh my God! Don t do that... feel my heart. Go ahead. I m dying here...
No, I really like my tongue... we re very attached. Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won t get angry.
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I m late for a wenching.
How do you know?
I cursed then all!
You d lose your security deposit?
Bartok... a question.
He s her?
" Wake up, your highness " we should start getting used to saying it.
But it s not the money, Vlad.
What do you mean?
Rasputin!
The same thing I wanted ten years ago all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
No. Empress, you
I should go
Promise me she ll have her home.
And tell me that she s happy.
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river... YES!
You gave the orders!
Oh, heavens I must say, yes.
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can t Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
You wouldn t know it. It doesn t matter. What s the difference?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now
Come on.

You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
I I I mean, I m comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
M m, I don t know, sometimes I ask myself how I d stand up under torture.
That movie makes me feel guilty.
What what what what s the matter?
What what I don t... It s not natural! We re sleeping in a bed together. You know, it s been a long time.
It s always some kind of an excuse. It s You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We re we re probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.

Mine.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh?
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
It s it s got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I ll My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I ll pay for it.

Well, okay. Well, listen, I m gonna get a cigarette, okay?
Well, have you ever made love high?
It relaxes me.
Well, what s the difference, anyway?
Oh, come on, look who s talking. You ve been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years. You should smoke some o this. You d be off the couch in no time.
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
M m, wait, I got a great idea. Hang in there for a second. I got a little little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect. I just... there... There s a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there. M mmm. M mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
I don t know. You It s like you re you re removed.
U huh.
Let s just do it, all right?
Yeah, but that s not that s no good. I want the whole thing.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass because, you know, I m, like, a comedian
So if I get a laugh from a person who s high, it doesn t count. You know cause they re always laughin.
C c coll College audiences are so wonderful.
Are yuh?
No, I don t think so. No, I don t think they re gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think
I didn t follow you!
Why? Cause I... was walkin along a block behind you staring at you? That s not following!
Following is different. I was spying.
Paranoid? I m looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
Yeah well, I didn t start out spying. I I thought I d surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course " Contemporary Crisis in Western Man "!
What s the difference? It s all mental masturbation.
We re not having an affair. He s married. He just happens to think I m neat.
Who cares? Who cares?
David? You call your teacher David?
Oh, yeah? How d it go?
Yeah?
M m.
Me? I m I m one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
G go on, I m interested.
M hm.
Tsch. Rea All this happened in the first hour?
That s amazing. I I I... I ve been goin for fifteen years, I you know, I don t got... nothing like that in
You cried? I ve never once cried. Fantastic...
I whine. I I I sit and I whine.
Sinatra?
Yeah?
Well, well, sure... because he s a singer and you re a singer, you know, so it s perfect. So you re trying to suffocate yourself. It it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that s a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
Whatta you mean? Me?
Sinatra had gl You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I I m suffocating you?
Tsch, what d the doctor say?
Will it change your wife?
Yeah, but you said, " Will it change my wife "!
You said, " Will it change... " Wife. Will it change...
A bit rapidly. I don t care what you say about David, he s a perfectly fine teacher!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
Oh.
There s a spider in the bathroom.
There s a big black spider in the bathroom.
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
I can t sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
I know, I know, and a first aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
Yeah.
It was just great!
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
It really is lovely. It s in the bathroom.
Hey, don t squish it, and after it s dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o times.
Oh. What?
Yeah?
Yep. I didn t think it was that big, but it s a major spider. You got a broom or something with a
Snow shovel or anything or something.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with
It s for my complexion.
Oh, don t go, okay? Please.
Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh! Alvy?
W w whatta you mean?
Oh, I had the radio on.
I m sorry. I had the television set had the television
Oh, no, no, I think we re both much too mature for something like that.
It s all right for me, it s been terrific, you know? Better than either one of my marriages. See, cause... cause there s just something different about you. I don t know what it is, but it s great.
I don t know.
Tsch, why don t we get... why don t we get Rob, and the three of us ll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
That d be fun for yuh. Don t you think
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday s not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
What is this? Is this a... Present? Are you kidding?
Uh, yeah, uh... t t this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it s
What... huh?
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway? Let me see. Okay, let s... oooh, God! Oh, you knew I wanted this... God, it s terrific, God!
What thing?
Thing?
I don t know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it d be nice to meet some new people.
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
Constantly! I d say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
And... I don t know... I mean, six months ago I I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
But the thing is I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
I don t know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don t go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it s like I m going against my own feelings. I don t know I I can t win.
How can you say that? I mean, who said I I I I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Oh, I m sure it s a lot of fun, cause the Incas did it, you know, and and they they they were a million laughs.
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it s important to make a little effort once in a while.
Well, let s see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it s mine.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
Oh
Remember that day?
Thanks, honey.
Yeah, and I I tru you know, I trust her, because my my analyst recommended her.
Right. And you and you know what the beauty part is?
We can always come back together again. Because there s no there s no problem. Cause... Right.
You know, I I I don t think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Yeah.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that s all. Well, you look nice.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it s perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony s very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and and we play tennis. I mean, that s... that s a very big step for me, you know? I mean... I m able to enjoy people more.
What s so great about New York? I mean, it s a dying city. You read " Death in Venice. "
That s right, that s right. You only gave me books with the word " death " in the titles.
Alvy, you re incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You re just this person. You re like this island unto yourself.
No. We re friends. I wanna remain friends.
You re mad, aren t you?
Alvy, I can t say that that s true at this point in my life. I really just can t say that that s true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you re the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and and and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don t wanna Listen, listen, listen, uh h h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
I m late.
The what?
You mean they give awards for that kind o music?
Oh, hi, Duane, how s it goin?
Oh, yeah? Terrific.
Step up here!
Six year old boys don t have girls on their minds.
Why are you so hostile?
Commentary.
Hey, you wouldn t believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now... they re ahead two points.
" Why why do you always r reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories? he said as he removed her brassiere... "
Don t get upset!
I m too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
I can t.
My head is throbbing.
I have a headache.
Oswald and ghosts.
You catch Dylan?
You have a raccoon?
The only word for this is trans plendid. It s trans plendid.
He s God! I mean, this man is God! He s got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
I m a Rosicrucian myself.
Yeah.
It s unbelievably trans plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Oh, no, no, don t be... tsch... don t be silly. You know, I m startin it I m startin to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
Oh, tsch, thank you. H m.
I think I think there s too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
Hey.
I m not myself since I stopped smoking.
Whatta you mean?
May I see your license, please?
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely cause I ve had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend
You re crazy!
Alvy, you re a total paranoid.
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Why, Max? It s a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
Right, Max. California, Max.
Let s get the hell outta this crazy city.
We move to sunny L. A. All of show business is out there, Max.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren t you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
Right, right, so g get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is is anti Semitism.
But the I m not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Don t you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we re we re left wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I I live here.
We can show her the schoolyard.
Yes, I remember. He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Max, there s no crime, there s no mugging.
Max, I ve got a hit series.
Great, but nobody laughs at it cause your jokes aren t funny.
I don t know, I just got I got very dizzy... I feel dizzy, Max.
Oh, Jesus.
I don t know, I mean, I
No, no my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
M hm.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey s party.
Oh, no, no, that s bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
V. P. L.?
Yeah, she s a ten, Max, and that s great for you because you re you re used to twos, aren t you?
Yeah, you re used to the kind with the with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
And... uh
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He s my my food taster. Have you two met?
Yeah. Right.
You re an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
You think so? Do you really?
Hi, I m I m Tony Lacey.
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Are you... are you recording? Or do Are you with any label now?
... of possibly working together.
Yeah.
Hey
It was a wonderful set.
I don t know, this is strange to me, you know.
Oh.
Oh yeah, stay here? U huh.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it s gotten it s so dirty now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was a great beauty.
I was very charming.
A long time.
Oh yes.
Very well.
It s the way they do things.
A triumph. When did you get here?
Why didn t you come in?
Would it make a difference?
You don t want that. It s married and it s the neighbor.
You re fucking desperate.
Absolutely.
Absolutely not.
She s got great tits.
And you ve only just met.
Absolutely. And she s got great tits.
The camera loves her. A great actress.
No, what?
Oh, she s really enjoying it. I think. Is Mac okay?
Who, Sally?
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films. But those were all such great directors.
What?
Leo?
Leo? It was out to Jude Law. Jude passed.
October ish.
Leo. Leo s twenty eight, Cal.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
I m in mourning.
Not this time.
How nice for everybody. Come swimming. The water s glorious. You ll fix it. You ll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
You re coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won t even remember what it s about. You won t care who s in your damn movie.
What?
He s allergic.
To dander. Otis.
Didn t I say?
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know? He s got eyelashes yay long. They must be a foot long. The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
Borrow whatever you like.
Whatever you like. I m afraid it ll all be too big for you. Are you alright, Clair?
I d say it was down.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
Why would she care?
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
You think so!? I ve been working out a lot since the baby. And I ve been working. And that takes it s toll, you know.
Don t you miss it?
Really.
Really?
So this sitter can always reach me. I m still not used to leaving him.
Dander. He s allergic. Otis.
Pictures. They re always in my tote. I left my tote in the damn trailer. But! He s Mac all over again. Imagine Mac shrunk to two and a half feet. The fact is they probably didn t even need me for this birth.
He s not going tonight.
Well you could tell him otherwise. It was good of you to be all this help. But he doesn t want to go tonight.
And you re not the wife.
Fuck you.
Anymore.
What a nose. You missed your calling.
Sally?
I m not so sure. Look again in three months.
Ow! Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
When does he graduate high school?
Shit, I forgot to call her back. She s off on a trip somewhere. Oh God, my grandad s flat in London s been sold.
I should have damn well bought it. Well, we can t afford it. The movie s going to eat up a year of my life and I m getting paid next to nothing. Do you know how much Skye Davidson s getting? Four million.
Harry called.
Lucy overdosed.
She left a note.
Leave us alone right now.
Monica.
We live next door.
Excuse me?
Ya Vhol. What are you, a fucking Nazi?
You re crazy baby. I love you.
Do you want me to save you? Do you want me to save you?
Oh yeah... I m gonna save you.
Let me heal you, baby.
A perfect night.
Hm. We should do it again.
Hm. You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Not as a rule.
Hey! Would you?
I don t think so.
Give him a minute, Clair.
Anytime, sport.
Probably not.
I adore him.
I know. I know that. Don t spoil it.
We ve only been over this how many times?
Well, you re a tower of support.
We couldn t be on more solid ground.
He s directing now.
There s still time to undo this.
Did you invite them?
That was the plan. And you re thrilled to have them.
Did you tell Joe to behave?
Did he promise?
Just do what I say, alright?
Ryan s novel.
Hardly...
Through the sweats or not?
No. I missed that.
We re great.
Well, it might be Clair. They re threatening not to come...
They can t find a sitter... Hello? Excuse me? Yes, uh, hold on. Just a moment. It s Skye Davidson. She needs directions to the house. You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn t even invite my mother.
No, no of course not. It s Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck s sake.
I m going to throw up.
You ve got Cal. You ve got Gina. You ve got Skye? We re the leftovers.
Truce?
Dinner. Don t be angry.
Listen to yourself... Don t worry, it s alright. We ll find him. What s wrong with you?
Well he can t have gone far.
He ll find his way back.
Otis!!!!
This is a nightmare. We should have kept him upstairs.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Jesus, Sally. You are a medical miracle. The only person who s ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
Rave parties?! That s so typical you would think it was called rage. Perfect!
Sally, so I took a few pills. I went out dancing. I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you. I haven t lied to you. I told you about the people I ve slept with. I just didn t mention the few occasions I took drugs because you re so fucking judgmental I knew I d never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me. Sally, we re back, I love you. Trust that. Please let s not do this.
Otis!
Love?
That hasn t the first fucking thing to do with love. It s whether we can live together... like this! All the time.
DO I want anyone else? No. Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life? I m trying.
Just stop right there, Sally. We ve been through this.
Sally, first of all, you re talking bullshit. And second...
That is not true.
Every novel I ve had published in every language I ve dedicated to Lucy.
It s a novel.
Who the fuck do you think you are? The part of Genna is not just about you. It s about every woman I ve ever loved in my entire life. Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Hello? Last birthday was?
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it. And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Well there you go. I let you off the hook. You re one goddamn lucky actress.
Okay. If we could ve, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn t have got the thing made. Because I don t mean anything as a director, and your name doesn t mean fuck all anymore. And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you re phoning it in. That you don t have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Your director and your co star of your current movie. Don t dish if you can t take it, Sally.
Sally, for Christ s sake.
This is insanity. Sally...
Don t push me away.
Don t do this.
Don t do this!
You changed your mind.
What?! You aborted our child?!
You re not ready.
I wasn t part of that picture at all, was I? I wasn t part of that decision. Did I occur to you at all? It s a fucking farce. It s a fucking farce. How long did you think you could keep it going. You re amazing. Do you have any idea what you ve done to us?
I ll never forgive you.
I ll be with you.
Okay.
I guess.
Me too.
It s a Calder.
He s my favorite.
Will you make love with me?
Oh, you know, I am.
Sure.
Thanks, I ll take that. Champagne?
Nothing that can t be exchanged.
Congratulations on the deal. How exciting. Is Sally doing Sally? I mean it s Sally. The character that s based on Sally. The character that s based on Sally in the book.
Oh my God, I m a huge Skye Davidson fan. She s very beautiful.
But I am right, yes? She s based on Sally.
Still. Well. Let s drop it.
I m not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes. Mostly non fiction. Did you read the new Styron?
It s very good. I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it s very good. But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie and most of the time you say, " what s this? " You know? I sometimes think we re better off not reading the novel at all. Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we re going. Don t you find?
I don t know why Joe, we ve known each other how long...
Don t be silly.
Yes I know. I started to say... I started to say Joe that
You manage to throw me off balance. I adore you.
But I m always afraid I ll say something stupid.
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book / script thing, do you see?
He s the best dog in the world. They re both coming tonight. Not my idea.
What? Oh yeah, the camera man? They gave me a list.
Not particularly. Weird, isn t it? God I m rally up. Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Thanks, Mac. And thanks for being so supportive about all this. I really love you, you know.
I meant Sally.
Oh. You re serious.
You re an interior decorator, right?
In fits and starts and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me. So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic. And it keeps changing.
Yeah, we re in a constant state of flux. I see you ve moved up from the soft stuff.
Uh huh.
Oh.
No you re not.
Hm.
Very well put.
What?
Elitism?
And you know, he really does not.
Well, that s what Ryan thought. I was more generous, actually.
Alright. Please don t tell Ryan I m drinking.
I will treasure this.
I don t think so. I feel. I feel a bit funny.
Oh? It s easy. You just put one foot in front of the other... That s a good girl.
Here, drink this. Drink lots of water. Hold on to this. Take deep breaths. Nice and slow. Would you like a lolly?
You re never too old for a lolly. I m having one.
Lemon.
I think he s really angry with me too.
I m sorry.
That s a lot of those.
A lot of cakes.
And he doesn t smoke?
How long have you been married?
You must have been a baby.
I like you.
Sorry?
Yeah, it was. For a writer nothing s sacred. No, nothing at all.
I m so sorry.
Oh, I love that. I m just great. I m so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you. And I m so happy you asked me to. I m so touched. I know how private you and Sally are.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me. Women must tell you that. And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know? I am Genna. How many women must tell you that. And the script is wonderful. Wonderful and lean and visual...
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain? She didn t pull that out of thin air. It causes brain damage. You d better drink a lot of water.
Yes.
I m not going to leave you alone.
They re nothing like us.
There s only you, Ryan. You know what, Ryan? You re beautiful. I love you so much... You need...
You re not serious.
God willing.
Why?
Excuse me?
Don t go in, Ryan.
Sally?
Yes, great! It s a beautiful house.
Yes.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
There s a goddamn sign on the gate.
You fucking cow, can t you read?!
Not at all.
Yes.
Oh?
Thank you.
Oh?
Really??
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Who doesn t know about the infamous composer s conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
Do Peter Sellers again.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich s 13th Symphony.
Exactly! So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
Yeah.
If he were still alive, maybe.
Are you asking me to marry you?
Very.
It s a machine gun. I thought I d kill myself.
Suicidal. It s much less codependent.
You don t know she s a bitch.
It could be worse.
She could be playing the role in Joe s movie that should be yours.
You see, that s worse.
Like your business managers?
Oh, okay, forgive me. Your neighbors are here, for fuck s sake.
It s not ruined, for fuck s sake. It s one of your parties.
" How are you really doing, Panes? " " Lousy, thank you, I m falling apart. "
No. No, not like the last time. She was the rest of my life.
I wasn t finished.
" We can t stand seeing you like this, Panes. I hate you being alone. Why don t you stay with us for a while? " " I d love to, thanks. "
I didn t hear me say tonight.
" Otherwise, we d insist on your being here. "
I d cut off her red wine if I were you.
What does that mean?
Why don t you go fuck yourself?
I m worried about your Galiano.
Yes. Fine.
I don t want to talk about it.
I never like to talk about my work.
No. Not something new.
Nothing s wrong. It s great, okay? Having the time of my life. Mac s a fantastic director. And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn t been said. And it s great working with friends, blah blah blah.
Thanks.
Oh you know. No doubts. No second thoughts. Am I a monster?
That s not an answer, is it?
You don t need to thank me.
At 4: 30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes. I have it on tape.
Oh. Well, yes. It s extraordinary. You think you could sign it for us?
I don t mind...
And here they are!
Ah.
Hmm. Where are my kids?
I hope they re watercolors!
Yes.
Hm.
I thought it was okay where it was.
A notch above the storage room.
The both of you.
So how much do you hate her?
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes. You don t trust anyone.
Oh Soph...
And the food sucks, I know.
Sophia! I m not even pregnant!
Let s go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It s not the ticking clock shit, is it?
Honey, I m not worried about you. You are going to be a fantastic mom. Not an issue. I pressed you, remember? Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
He wants playmates. Oh he s a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he s not going to be a good father. He s just not parenting material.
And Cal s this massive adult?
You weren t exactly horrified.
Neither does Joe.
We re fine. We re great. We re having a baby and we re moving to London.
Not nice. Not kind.
Why are you doing this?
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Z, old pal... SHUT UP!!! It s bad enough there s a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
No, Z. The squeaky wheel gets thrown away, alright? You re a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear segment. I don t wanna see anything happen to you. So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground. Why are we even digging this thing?
I m new... I was born yesterday.
Nobody told me digging was so much fun! You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers
Sorry I got you in trouble. But listen, you can share my rations.
No I mean yes I mean if you don t have other plans.
Invisible!
Well... I declared war!
It s a shame he died prematurely... I was hoping to kill him myself.
You miss him? Why?
I work in the palace, I don t get out much.
Well, actually, uh I m sort of making it up
Why should everyone dance the same way? It s as exciting as watching fungus grow.
You you think I m right?
Oh, that s okay, I ll let him off this time. Are you crazy? This guy s built like a pebble! You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays
Wait! When can I see you again?
I m Princess Bala.
Yes.
Divinely?
No... as a matter of fact...
I CAN T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Quiet sshhh!!
How should I know?
Who s the bigger idiot the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
Of course! It defines society! To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
No! There s no such thing as " just two ants. " You never see just two ants you see a million ants!
Well I guess that makes us even.
Oh come on, you re the one who came after me the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Well, that s an appealing offer, but... considering the options... You go back. Me, I m going to Insectopia.
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source... that it exists. Now you follow the yellow egg... That direction.
I ve got a name. It s Z.
Water... water oh, you already said that.
Want a list?
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Hlllllllp!
General Formica won t let me die out here. I m his fiancee.
Five thousand three hundred and ninety no. About five thousand four hundred by now.
Well... no, but
Come on... tell me there wasn t just a little... something between us that first night at the bar. The night we danced.
You were right... you were right! Z, it s beautiful!
Yes?
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
You held onto this all that time?
You did?
I just joined up. But I m quitting! I got a trial membership!
Yeah. Well no. She s kind of playing hard to get. As a matter of fact, she s playing completely unattainable. So, what s on the schedule? A brisk walk? a foraging expedition?
Be honest, kid am I hurt bad?
No I can see it in your eyes. I m a goner. It s alright, Z. In this ant s army, a soldier s life ain t worth a sack of fungus. I can t feel my legs...
I wonder... what... was it all... for...
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Scattered reports, sir. Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Yeah... I mean... well... I don t know, really, sir.
Oh, no, sir!
I... I have no idea, sir.
That s correct, sir!
Now I ve heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a food shortage. Well you boys are gonna be taken care of. But in the meantime we re gonna eat the enemy for breakfast, we are gonna eat the enemy for lunch, and we are gonna eat the enemy for dinner!
Damn, I m proud of you, boy. I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble. Now, time for some R and R. You re invited to the royal victory party!
Of course. The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death s back. So, tell me, fellow war monger... do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
Engaged? As in you re getting married?
So... you two are in love?
Yes, and do you know why there s a food shortage?
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other s heart...
Well it wasn t a masquerade, really, it was more what I d call a clever ruse
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
Look, General! A darling baby soldier! Don t try to be a hero! Just make sure you come back in one piece! Next!
But General this tunnel is your baby! You re sure you can t stay?
Very well, General I know you all work and no play!
I don t know what you re talking about, Z.
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me. Don t you want your aphid beer?
Z, we ve known each other a long time, right?
And all the time I ve known you, you ve been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves. Go with the flow.
I m not in the mood. Even when they re off work, they follow orders.
Are you kidding? There were sparks between us! This scarf is a sign!
I can t think of any.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
You re a real buddy.
What do I do?
My mother.
I mean barging in on your mother in the middle of the night?
Sheldrake?
Care to make a small wager?
Shall we say a dollar?
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off. Big mistake, huh?
Yeah. I better not get too close.
Really? I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
Why?
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I m in the top ten efficiency wise and this may be the day promotion wise.
Why not? Now that they re kicking me upstairs
Really?
I hope so. Wouldn t you know they d call me on a day like this with my cold and everything How do I look?
I almost didn t recognize you this is the first time I ve ever seen you in civilian clothes.
Great. Look have you seen The Music Man?
Would you like to?
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first and then
Yeah.
Oh. You mean like a girl friend?
Just tell em now and then.
It used to be serious at least I was but he wasn t so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
I m afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him he s been calling me all week
What time does the show go on?
Well I could meet you at the theatre if that s all right.
How is your cold?
So I see.
Sounds good. How do you know where I live?
How come?
Oh.
Thank you. I thought you were avoiding me.
In the last six weeks you ve only been in my elevator once and then you didn t take your hat off.
I don t blame you. It was unforgivable.
You shouldn t.
Don t be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform that doesn t make me a Girl Scout.
I shouldn t drink when I m driving.
Why not? They seem friendly enough.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Nothing. There are just too many people here.
No I like it.
Of course not.
Much better.
This is a bad day for me.
I d better get back to my elevator. I don t want to be fired.
Why?
I m afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
I think so.
The mirror it s broken.
Oh. Yes? Just a minute. If you don t mind this is sort of personal
Oh, yes office party Miss Olsen
I don t understand
Miss Kubelik you shouldn t be out of bed.
What kind of talk is that? So you got a little over emotional but you re fine now.
Two o clock.
You don t want me here
I just want to go brush my teeth
No I don t want anything.
My sister she ll want to know what happened to me.
Well, I haven t figured it out, exactly.
I ll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
Someone from the office.
In his apartment.
I mean her apartment.
Baxter.
As soon as I can walk.
No it s my stomach.
They had to pump it out.
That s why we have to be careful we don t want to involve anybody after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man
He doesn t give a damn about me.
Oh, I don t mind. As a matter of fact, I m sort of flattered that anybody should think a girl like you would do a thing like this over a guy like me.
Yes, I ve got it. Don t you think we d better destroy it? So it won t fall into the wrong hands?
That s right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
I m not very good at it.
Give what up?
Yeah I know what you mean. Queen.
A bad insurance risk?
A cemetery?
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him he ll be out in 1965.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated but I flunked the typing test
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can t spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator that s how I met Jeff Oh, God, I m so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
Was he really upset when you told him?
Maybe he does love me only he doesn t have the nerve to tell his wife.
You really think so?
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
I m going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
As one woman to another I m sure she ll understand
Well, for one thing, you can t spell. And secondly if you did something like that you d hate yourself.
Pick up your cards and let s go.
Sure.
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
I just want some fresh air.
So they ll shoot me like a horse.
Who d care?
Why can t I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
For me?
I don t want to talk to him.
Sure. What s that funny smell?
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
Are you supposed to?
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
It s very curious I could only find three and a half pair.
As a matter of fact, I m a pretty good cook but I m a lousy housekeeper.
It s just that I m the kind of guy who can t say no I don t mean to girls I mean
I guess so.
A what?
I wouldn t say that What would you like to have for diner? There s onion soup and canned asparagus
You did?
Over a girl?
No, I don t.
Where?
In the knee?
That s terrible.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
So let em. Look, I m going to cook dinner for us. We ll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You ve done enough for one day.
No just come as you are.
You usually eat alone?
The dishes?
What?
I don t?
Oh.
Fine. How s your eye?
Nothing s changed. You know, we never finished that gin game
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I m very happy for you.
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn t using me I was using him. See? Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor now I m on the twenty seventh floor, paneled office, three windows so it all worked out fine we re both getting what we want.
Aren t you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
That s very wise.
I m fine.
I m fine all over.
That s funny so am I. What did you do with the cards?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Dobisch said that?
Well, you know how it is things pile up.
I don t know.
Look, Baxter, I m not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building in every department on every floor every day of the year.
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I. B. M. machines so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
That s right, Baxter.
What kind of joint are you running?
There s a certain key floating around the office from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch it s the key to a certain apartment and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Are you going to deny it?
You better.
Just those four out of a total of 31, 259 so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel percentage wise.
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I ve been going through with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key
Well, I don t want to intrude and I thought since it s all straightened out anyway
Yes, sir.
Not yet. But I hear it s one swell show.
You mean you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City
Well, that s very kind of you only I m not feeling well you see, I have this cold and I thought I d go straight home.
So do I I m going to take four aspirins and get into bed so you better give the tickets to somebody else
That s good thinking, Baxter. Next month there s going to be a shift in personnel around here and as far as I m concerned, you re executive material.
Relax, Baxter.
Yes, of course.
Oh, you don t have to worry
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it s none of my business four apples, five apples what s the difference percentage wise?
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you
Fine. And I want you to know I ll work very hard to justify your confidence in me SHELDRAKE Sure you will. Say, Baxter, about the apartment now that you got a raise, don t you think we can afford a second key?
You know my secretary Miss Olsen
No, you don t understand. She s a busybody always poking her nose into things and with that key passing back and forth why take chances?
I mean the young lady whoever she may be it was on the couch when I got home last night.
The mirror is broken. It was broken when I found it.
Sir?
I know how it is.
No, sir. That s very unfair especially to your wife.
Yes, sir. That s the life, all right.
I hate to disturb you, but something came up it s rather important and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me at the apartment as soon as possible.
I didn t want to tell you over the phone but that certain party you know who I mean I found her here last night she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
That s impossible. You ll have to handle this situation yourself as a matter of fact, I m counting on you
Good. Is there anything you need money?
Oh. Well, if there s anything I can do for you
And I ve got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik well, stop worrying I m going to take her off your hands.
That s right. I ve moved out of my house I m going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
Well, if you must know I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain t that a kick in the head?
Now what was your news, Baxter?
Mine?
Well, it s just that so many things have been happening so fast I m very pleased especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I ve gotten to know her better, I think she s the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody
I got kicked in the head, too.
You re working too hard, Baxter. It s New Year s Eve relax.
I suppose you ll be on the town tonight celebrating?
Me, too. I m taking Miss Kubelik out I finally talked her into it
The only thing is I m staying at the Athletic Club and it s strictly stag so if you don t mind
You know that other key to your apartment well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I d better get rid of it quick so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
Now I ll have to borrow your key.
What do you mean, sorry?
I m not just bringing anybody I m bringing Miss Kubelik.
How s that again?
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you re doing? Not to me but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty seventh floor but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
No I didn t.
Just following doctor s orders. I ve decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes
Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka he s Miss Kubelik s he s got a cab downstairs
You?
I know, Buddy boy, I know. But those things don t always run on schedule like a Greyhound bus.
Sure, sure. Look, kid I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
That s right. We were discussing our department manpower wise and promotion wise and I told him what a bright boy you were. They re always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
I know. Mr. Eichelberger in the Mortgage Loan Department last night he had a little Halloween party here
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby. You still owe me for the last two bottles
Oh, how are you, Baxter. They keeping you busy these days?
Oh, yes. She s the best operator in the building.
Maybe you re using the wrong approach.
Could be she s just a nice, respectable girl there are millions of them.
Instead of Friday could you possibly switch to Thursday? You d be doing me a great favor
What do you want?
Baxter, I don t want to pull rank on you but I told the lady it was all set you want to make a liar out of me?
Well, that s very nice of you but who is this?
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch. I didn t recognize your voice
I m sorry, Mr. Dobisch. You know I like to help you guys out but it s sort of late so why don t we make it some other time?
I don t care if it is Marilyn Monroe I m already in bed and I ve taken a sleeping pill so I m afraid the answer is no.
Of course not. But how can I be efficient in the office if I don t get enough sleep at night?
I m all out of liquor and there s no clean glasses no cheese crackers no nothing.
It s not Picasso I m calling about. It s the key to my apartment you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
Oh, I found a key there, all right only it s the wrong key.
And I couldn t get into my apartment so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
You ll be a lot sorrier before we re through with you.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof I ve got you down here for tonight but I m going to be using the place myself so I ll have to cancel.
I hate to disappoint you I mean, many happy returns but not tonight
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I m sick I have this terrible cold and a fever and I got to go to bed right after work.
Oh, no. I d get pneumonia and if I got pneumonia, I d be in bed for a month and if I were in bed for a month
You know, that big shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
Because as far as I m concerned, he s a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter never even answered me.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
My husband. He s in Havana in jail.
Mickey? He wouldn t do nothing like that. He s a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
No.
No.
No.
She may be a girl but she s no friend of mine.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don t know me very well.
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it s time for me to go and I may go just like that I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
Well, they haven t got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let s not waste any time preliminary wise.
Good night.
The party s over.
Nothing. Just clear out, will you?
Who?
No kidding. Buddy boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
A. W. O. L.?
Why not? We don t owe Buddy boy anything.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I m all right now so let s go.
Come on, Fran.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I m Miss Olsen Mr. Sheldrake s secretary.
Let me take that.
It s on the way. I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
You know I liked it better long.
Six weeks. But who s counting?
Like old times. Same booth, same song
Same sauce sweet and sour.
Let s not start on that again, Jeff please. I m just beginning to get over it.
Look, Jeff we had two wonderful months this summer and that was it. Happens all the time the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl They don t make these shrimp like they used to.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake I m full up. You ll have to take the next elevator.
Not here, Fran. Can t we go some place else?
Important?
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented and me in a black negligee and a life preserver
We talked about a lot of things.
We didn t talk about it you did.
They got it an a long playing record now Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn t understand me We haven t gotten along for years You re the best thing that ever happened to me
Just trust me, baby we ll work it out somehow
I wasn t trying.
Okay. I m sorry.
Handle what?
Let s get something straight, Jeff I never asked you to leave your wife.
Are you sure that s what you want?
You know I do.
Yeah that s me. The Happy Idiot a million laughs.
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today I ran into your secretary Miss Olsen. You know ring a ding ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
I was never very good at history. Let me see there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi no, she came before it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen
And just think right now there s some lucky girl in the building who s going to come after me
It s Christmas Eve, Fran let s not fight.
Yeah, we better.
Don t ever talk like that, Fran! Don t make yourself out to be cheap.
Stop that, Fran.
You run along I want to fix my face.
Sure. Monday and Thursday and Monday again and Thursday again
Of course I m not here because the whole thing never happened I never took those pills I never loved you we never even met isn t that the way you want it?
All set for what?
Atlantic City?
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring a ding ding.
Baxter?
He wouldn t.
The nerve.
I don t know. I guess that s the way it crumbles cookie wise.
First you can t wait to get me up here, and now rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
What guy? Whose apartment is this, anyway?
I told you with my mother.
A hundred and seventy ninth street the Bronx.
Like hell you will. You ll buy me a cab.
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia instead of Friday could we make it Thursday night?
What gives?
Go where?
She s home stuffing a turkey.
It s a thought.
See if they ll what?
Yeah
What s it matter? Get to the point.
Captain Willard go ahead.
Yeah.
Dreadful.
Well
I m not that fond of blondes maybe I like brunettes
I like all of them
I said I like all of them.
Wait wait don t get up tight what I meant was we d need a whole drum for that
My men
We have a lot of pride in our unit
Esprit de corps
One for all all for one
Get out
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too
Part.
I m sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
No.
Yeah. Way north.
None.
Let s talk about you.
Tracks?
Fat. That s real fat.
At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry?
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn t believe how much water they had. We d been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we d been drinking anything rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could ve killed them. I swear to God I would have, too, if...
We do.
A long time.
He was working A. R. V. N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn t give it back.
Yes, sir
Call me what, sir?
No, sir I m a real chef, sir I m a sauciere
That s right, sir I come from New Orleans I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It s what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
Cook school that did it.
No shit.
Probably is.
How much is left?
Looks that way.
Not a thing.
Yeah, I know.
... he s an amazing officer.
Chief, try to keep out of where we re going Why we re goin and what s gonna be the big surprise.
We re gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief?
Shot himself. What for?
You ll see soon enough get going, sailor
Who knows what s up there?
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I m the responsible party.
When d you do it?
Signs?
What is it?
Which way? Right or left?
One that went up for murder he was an Army Sergeant.
Clear on starboard Where s Lance an the Captain?
If you re B. L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we d like you to come with us.
Would he remember you?
Ours.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this even rumours leaked out.
Exactly you ll go up the Nung River in a Navy P. B. R. appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what s happened and why. Then terminate his command.
Yeah, it still runs.
What re you askin me for put em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
Charlie?
Charlie?
Colonel Kurtz, he s dead.
This gentleman or myself?
I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right?
A lame?
About what?
But why?
Well, he s killing now.
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
Of course. I Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
You ll get blown outta here some day.
The Vietnamese think it s theirs I guess the Americans do, too.
Do you know that jungle?
Gunner s Mate, Third Class L. Johnson, sir.
Thank you, sir.
I haven t surfed since I got here.
What, sir?
What?
Boss left.
It s hairy, though. That s where we lost McDonnel they shot the hell out of us. It s Charlie s point.
Wh what?
It s still pretty hairy, sir.
Hell s Angels Four to Big Duke Six we ll need green smoke suggest you have the FAC mark it.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six We re even got some rockets left.
I got bored in Saigon.
Haiphong.
No. Walked.
Mercenaries agents, traitors they put out caches.
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you ll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
When did you hear?
Who knows.
I met him.
He musta changed! I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
Hairy?
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
I met him.
You ll find enough Cong up there.
Music?
Who?
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees probably eleven millimeter guns and AK 47 s.
I m Kurtz.
We were attacked down river. We need supplies and medical help.
No no, sir.
What do you mean, Colonel?
You re gonna get hit tonight, bad a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
Yeah, I like it...
You can t have water after morphine.
How s the pain?
I can handle it.
What Truth?
No water.
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best is lie.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
Fuck no.
What are you doing?
I m taking you back. You can still live.
I m gonna get you out of here.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
What?
Yeah... thanks.
Nah.
Which one s the Colonel s?
No I don t think so. But it ll be back. They were circling. It ll be back.
When?
A Yater spoon is hard to get especially here.
Sure.
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
Where s Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Why did they attack us?
You re Australian?
So Kurtz is alive.
Why didn t he shoot you?
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn t be crazy if you heard him talk, just last week, you d never think he was crazy.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
His name is...
I m sorry to hear that.
I should be checking on the boat.
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
Kurtz. I know you ve heard of him.
What did you hear?
What things?
Yes.
I know.
They re in order it s perfectly clean just check with ComSec Intel like I said.
Right now I am.
Big show in the parade grounds this noon some boss stuff
Stepped on a booby trap, sir got blown all to hell
Beverly Hills
Straight up the road a concrete bunker Beverly Hills where else you think he d be?
Let s keep going. We re only an hour from Devil s Cauldron.
Okay by me. You re the one likes these hot springs so much.
Can t be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
Yep. Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
New to the country, kid?
A daughter in Oregon.
I needed a pilot s license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it. Now we re in my territory.
That s right. You re not.
We re not sitting here til November. There s a cargo plane coming to Devil s Cauldron in four days, and I m putting you on it.
It wasn t my idea to crash the plane.
We ve got another two hours of daylight.
Forget it. It would take days.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
You know Meyerling?
I m here to do my job.
Yeah?
Too bad we re heading west.
How many do you see?
You don t feel cold?
Where s my ELT?
You got one?
An appetite. Maybe you won t die after all.
Told that s what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears. Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat. That was fine money.
Yeah, it is fucked up but it s not too late to keep that from happening here.
Don t bet on it.
You broke the radio, remember?
I liked you better frozen. You didn t talk so much.
Lets us watch each other s backs over a wide area. Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should ve been.
Shut up!
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
Wound s a through and through. Missed my liver, I think.
Like I said, I d still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn t for you.
Ben... boys. Yeah, real slow, and I d like to keep it that way.
I m living proof of that sad fact.
I got it from here. Thanks.
If that was all, fine. But carving him up, stranding the others, that s too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
I don t want to hurt you, Sam.
What s the problem with Sam Wilder s place?
Pretty clever: If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam s is the first place they ll look. They may figure you re waiting for an airplane, so you can t stay in the shack by the airstrip. Last place they d expect you is on the far side of town. I can t afford any trouble
Forget it. And try not to bleed on my throw rugs. Why do this?
Sure.
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
Look, Neff, I ve got Ben Corbett with me
I m putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Yeah. Sorry I barked at you last night.
What are you talking about?
There ll be three, four men at the most. I have some backup, nothing will happen.
What does this matter to you?
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
Fuck you.
Damn. Likely that s an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
That s what we should ve done in the first place.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in. Maybe more for lettin him loose. I was up in my cache. Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble. We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Huh?
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can t help?
I m on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
I still don t feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Go ahead.
Spencer s doing fine. So what are you saying, that you re frustr...
Stop treating this like I m going away with a man. He s just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom I hate this. He s a freak show the worst person I ever met.
Don t be silly. How bad?
I ve got Jews at my table.
You re gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
I see the help judgement call.
What s wrong with your son, anyway?
No.
His name?
Okay.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
Well, not until now for Christ s sake.
How old are you?
Otherwise, you re not ugly.
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
What subject? That I wasn t there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
How do you know about my mother?
Carol the waitress?
I was working... can t you just drop me a thank you note?
Note. Put it in the note.
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
I don t think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
Yes. I m going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won t read is that somehow you ve done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I ve ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
Thank you.
I want you to go on this trip.
I can t do this alone. I m afraid he ll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I m on the hook.
Two days.
You take off when you have to.
Bettes tells me he s doing fine.
What s that got to do with it?
Write me a note and ain t she sweet. I need a hand and where d she go.
Is there another way to see it?
Are you still coming?
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you re going to ask next. That you might ask I m not certain.
Oh. We might. Yes. We can. Let s.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
It s okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Nonsense!
I ve been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
That s not compliment, Melvin... That s just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Fries.
Don t be pessimistic. It s not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake. I have this what? Ailment... And my doctor a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. " Hate, " I am using the word " hate " about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you d never well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
Never.
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
It s one idea...
I don t know why I brought you that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don t want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
This one has a special meaning.
I ll take a bus.
Yeah... Well...
I can trust my brain.
I don t know whether I m being sensible or hard on you.
See. There s an example. I don t know whether you re being cute or crazy now.
Go ahead.
Okay. Good bye.
Were you asleep?
' Cause if you were asleep I m sorry. And you could be grouchy.
... Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn t even try.
Were you asleep?
What a break...
I had to see you...
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
See. It s four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don t mind.
You know what? I...
Yes. I really would.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren t along.
I don t think so. You need help with the pants?
I m going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
I m sorry... are you okay?
Why? What have you been thinking about?
No... Absolutely not. I m shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
Stop staring. Do a vase.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
No. No. Get Carol.
What are you trying to do to me?
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app
Shhhhhhh. I don t have this mountain of available time... I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
Your neighbor Udall is taking care of him.
No, I promise... not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I m on the move too much. Trust me.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don t intimidate me.
I m not saying nothing to you.
It s been five weeks... another few won t kill me.
Sure take him to the vet.
Really nice. Shouldn t that be a good thing... telling someone, no thanks required. '
" What? " Look at you... You sense a mark.
About a dog.
Concerned. I m just the hall monitor here.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they ve got to help those are the rules. Good.
If there s some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Frank s idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn t get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Not just today Uh, could you do it until, until he gets back on his feet?
You re a wonderful man. Two o clock is a good time. Here s the key in case he s asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God s beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
How come you re pretending to do cop work cause I don t think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Ask him.
How re you doing?
Do you realize that I work at him?
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there s fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there s a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you re going to faint even then don t come knocking or, if it s election night and you re excited and want to celebrate because some fudge packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he s going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone... don t knock... not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
I called. I never touched you. I didn t leave my name or nothing.
It smells like shit in here?
That cleaning woman doesn t...
Where are all your queer party friends?
Nellie, you re a disgrace to depression.
Get out.
Oh, my gosh.
Come on, sweetheart...
Thanks.
But sick nauseous where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Melvin...
You consider your life easy.
Another place where?
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
I m a great guy " extraordinary "...... and she doesn t want contact with me. I m dying here.
No... and you re supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
I don t know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out. Because I m stuck! Can t go back to what I had... She s evicted me from my life.
It was better than this... Look, you, I m very intelligent. If you re going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you re doing. If you can t be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I m drowning and you re describing water.
Well, if that s true then I m really in trouble.
Absolutely not.
Hey... I m charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
What s it mean?
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
The fact that you haven t said, " hold it " means I haven t done it right... is that correct? I haven t done it right?
Just a second he has to go.
No. No problem. The airport, right?
Where?
What restaurant?
So you re from around here?
What is this?
Look, I m real tired and I m not interested in fucking chit chat.
Didn t you here all them sirens? It s been all over the radio. Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
Yeah, it s terrible. I mean Valli, and I don t care what office he s running for, the guy s a crook. He probably had it coming, but all the other people. Real sad.
But they caught the guy. I heard it all. Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco. Shooting anybody. Drugs, probably.
What?
You re right. Talking too much again.
What? You think I m running you up?
Get out. You think I m running you up? Get out.
No fucking way.
What s your name? We both know it s not Nicholai.
How long have you been freelance?
It s just a shoot out then. Sixty forty, at best. Not my odds.
Tachlinkov.
After those cops, you ll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
We go around once.
I knew the same way in ten years you re going to know.
I ain t scared of you.
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
That s right.
What?
Oh, yeah.
You would be.
Why don t you tell me.
Yes. This is the Hotel Paraiso.
I m sorry, sir. A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
He has to clean up. How many bodies were there?
What? How did you know I had a cat?
Who the fuck are you? Who do you work for?
Yeah.
What do you mean, that s all? What in the hell do you know?
Ten million
You re the computer hacker, you tell me.
' Them?
Until a minute ago.
Another contractor.
No. They hired Bain. The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
Because he is trying to retire me.
Yes.
The nature of the business. You remove your competition.
Yes.
Right.
It s simple. You need me. I need you. And we will both need money.
This is something that is never going to end. You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding. And that s going to take money, a lot of money.
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
Because he took a contract on you. He ll come for you and he ll find you.
No. It s the truth. I know what you are. Like me, like Bain, you re a ghost, you re not part of the real world. You don t have a social security number. You don t pay taxes. You ve probably used ten different names over the last ten years. A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy. You think you can do it again. But I m telling you, fading from the law is nothing. No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
Rath. Robert Rath.
Just Electra?
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
What do you want to know?
Why?
It s not the same, is it?
We played with a code using The New York Times obituaries. Over three years we played twelve matches. I never won.
Why?
Where you wanted to be?
How did you get into the business?
The C. I. A.?
How old were you?
Jesus why?
You were like a boy genius?
Why not?
You went from high school to the Agency?
They didn t give you a choice, did they?
But you knew what they were training you for?
Ahhhh...
The exotic women.
Why not?
Why?
Why did you leave the Agency?
They tried to kill you?
Then you went freelance?
Tell me about the first time.
Yes.
Because I want to know.
Are they usually like that?
After that?
Did it ever bother you?
That s fiction.
You said you didn t trust it.
Several.
Where is it?
Thinking.
I don t know.
What?
Why not?
Oh. What do you think about?
Yes.
No.
No.
I don t know... maybe I ll live on a boat, sail to all the places I ve never been.
Here?
Okay.
He won t be looking for you. Just be careful. Buy a book. Keep your sunglasses on.
Sorry.
Taiwan.
Thank you.
Transmits and receives.
They saw you coming a mile away. If I had known we d be using
Check.
But he won t shoot you right then?
Okay. Then what?
Aiiee. More waiting? I don t know if I like this plan.
Why won t he wait until the bank closes?
That means you won t have a gun.
And with the mikes, I ll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you ll tell me when he leaves the bank.
You ll have the money. How do I know that you won t
We split the money?
Sounds pretty well figured out.
Except
Except, if he doesn t come out of the hotel.
You can t know for sure, how can you? I mean, you re not him.
For Nicholai?
I don t know. It just happened. I was here ten years ago, I m here now. That s it.
It wasn t planned or premeditated. I swear. Things happened beyond my control. I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
Yes.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank. He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business. To disappear to some empty Greek island.
He said I couldn t win. That no one wins at this game.
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
No. I went back to the hotel. And waited.
No.
I hate bishops. They re useless. I like knights.
I didn t notice them.
How do you know they re not?
What?
Jesus, if someone had
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
Thank you.
No.
It s always been that way. The world has always functioned on two levels.
Why?
And you were drilling these holes...?
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Did he explain how this happened?
What?
Why?
I m sure you will.
Are you attracted to me?
Why?
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
I didn t want to complicate the situation.
It can be.
Yes.
Someone like me, like you. A pro.
She was taken.
No. I tried to stop it. I couldn t.
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It s dangerous to let things become complicated.
No.
Honestly?
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
Why?
I m not normal.
What?
Shit.
Right.
Okay.
What?
The point is, they are paying for information. Real information. Not tooth paste brands. Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper. And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone s time with this shit.
God damnit, Electra. This is not a game. This is business.
Jesus! Why didn t you tell me?
Electra
Everyone regrets something.
Sometimes.
All the time.
Do you believe that?
Sure.
Why not?
It s possible.
I hope not.
It s a common question.
A dime.
Average.
Taken.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
That s what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I d be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I m not. I m trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can t. It seems very funny to me.
I m thinking about Moonpies. Ain t that funny? I haven t had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I m thinking how much I d love one.
Go ahead.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying. It wouldn t go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it s okay. I feel good.
Anything.
You mean quit?
I used to think about it. I had Margaret. She wanted kids. I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe. I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn t see that next part. Then what? So I d stop thinking about it and go back to work. You understand?
That s correct.
American currency.
I m sorry, but I am waiting for an associate. Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
A coke, if they have it?
Naz dravi!..... What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don t know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
It s okay, they re training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
I don t know, I don t care. I see too much of him and he s changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he s been doing nothing for months, like he doesn t care about anything, including me.
It won t last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
Like you?
Son of the American ambassador and a banker good enough?
Yeah right!.... I don t know, something isn t right with this place, it s all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there s no Czechs here?
Yeah, but it s not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn t, then it s not radical and not worthy of a look in.
We re only joking..... It is your round though!
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
What s that? Free!
What did the beer cost?
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
An alternative literary venue!
No, it s the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin building.
Maybe, but someone s got to make a stand.
Care to elaborate?
Amazing, he didn t even say " if ".
Well, it s like I said, there s a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they re not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
I don t know man, I ll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
Alright I give in. But let s not end up in jail. Okay?
He was an electrician?
That makes you an expert I guess.
Scout around and see if there s something, check that other corridor. If there s nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
So?
Yeah, you re in luck there s two of them, the other s in there.
I thought that was part of the charm!
A locksmith too? Why d you ever bother with writing?
I ll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
And if the police stop by what do I tell them?
Thought of everything haven t you.
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that s all.
I ll try not to, I ll leave that to you. Anyway, there s still plenty more of it.
' cause you stink of booze.
Nope, not even close. I ve thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
No.... The Asylum!
None, it s mine you said it earlier, I m nuts.
Yeah, I m beginning to see that.
Can you do the lock on it?
But how did the wall get here?
Don t we have enough already?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
I don t know Doug, we haven t even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
I had a better idea, we ll burn them. There s a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
Have you ever stolen anything?
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
No, for the Asylum.
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
Jesus Doug, they ll execute us!
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
Look at it this way, it s their contribution. If we d explained it to them, they d probably have given it to us anyway.
Am I late?
You should have said it was Bring A Bottle.
No beer?
Why don t we go together?
No, not yet.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
I fell in love.
No, the boyfriend.
Didn t I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
Holly!
It just happened.
She s cool.
What are you on about?
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
What?
You might make Henry happy...... Sure, I ll do it.
You capitalist pig!
Tell me some bad news?
That bad?
So I hear.
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I m a stray soccer hooligan.
He got that one right.
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
What happened?
You re kidding.
WE gotta think of something.
So?
Lucky break!
Did you see anything in the files?
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
No point, it ll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I m right, they could be my ticket out of here.
Siberia.
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn t work. You d better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave s for my call tomorrow, if you don t hear from me by three o clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
Sure.... Anything else I can do for you?
Some deal you did there!
What?
What are you talking about?
No!
Do you know the way?
No, by road?
That one?
Okay, but I don t want to miss him.
Doug?
I m just here to record some details, standard stuff.
So am I.
Yes.
Yes.
That s my mum s.
No!
No!
They didn t look like medical files to me.
Doug, haven t seen you for a while.
Have you met Holly? Josh s friend.
Sure. Excellent.
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
Really?
Shhhhh, I m concentrating!
You used to read.
I ll get the drinks, but not here. Let s split. I can t stand this any more, it s murdering my respect for literature.
What?
What? You are crazy!
We should go to the Metro it s quicker.
So, we won t be going to London?
Everybody is at home, it s no good.
No way Doug, I can t.
No.
I m not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can t do that shit.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
I m no good for you Katka, besides I won t be able to stay in Prague.
There s nothing there for me.
No, it s not true, you re lying.
Sure, I ve done it easily.
Later. Jahn, I ve been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don t you?
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
It s not so much.
Can we charge admission?
Yep, it s all yours.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
Great.... How long will it go for?
Yeah, great.... Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
Ah, so what?
How?
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you re not crapping me?
What pay check? You ain t done nothing!
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
What for?
I don t know maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
No, it should be over soon.
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
Am I invited?
We don t need you.
Well, I ve failed at everything else I ve done and I can t hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
It s a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do gooders back in the States.
I moving more to Communism now it s dying out.
No, I m just running scared, same as everyone else.
No, just a coffee.
I had it coming from someone.
Uh huh!
Yeah, but it was okay.
Hmm, I still owe him.
It s Josh s.
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
That s right.
It was the biggest I could find.
A kind of freedom.
No!
Thanks, but I don t intend to stay.
I have the Director s word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs.... Now, where are the disks?
Yeah!
A drill, what are you up to?
Yeah.
You don t have fifty foot of apartment!
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
No problem, is it at your place?
But I have to finish this....
Just yesterday.
Later.
What for?
Go to hell!
You bastard!
Josh, I have to speak you, it s urgent.
Josh, I need your help. Doug s been arrested, he s in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
Yes, if you can get him free.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
I don t understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
All the more reason to eliminate him.
Very well.
With you.
I m sorry about how we
And I have no idea why.
Kelly wouldn t do that.
You don t need a car you can t drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
I don t want his money.
That s over. Way over.
We talked. He wanted to get a bite after. I said no.
He wants to show now.
You re fine like that, Mom.
Thanks.
Late night. You?
Yeah.
I could take after Dad, too.
I meant he s a doctor.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
Landon
He wants to talk to you.
You do
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that
This your idea of small talk?
Were?
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What s more to know?
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
I don t want to have any conversation.
' They won t. '
This play means a lot to me.
Your act only works with an audience.
Why?
Like me.
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
Go for it.
It s private.
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery
He s a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
The world of the dead?
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
The dirty snowball at its core.
In ten words or less?
My relationship with God is my own.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
I know there s a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don t understand what the message is or what the point is.
You don t believe in anything?
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
Yeah
Belinda s a very jealous person.
That s it! Exactly! You re reading my mind
It s not.
You don t know the first thing about being someone s friend
You don t know what you want
And why would that scare me?
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
What?
Why not?
I have to get you home by one.
No.
We re doing something?
You re sometimes not sure?
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
Loved?
Where?
What would you do up here?
Where s the one you re building?
Mars.
You planned this
What about your father?
I don t care.
That what you do?
No.
Pull over.
I m sick.
I should have told you sooner
Anything you want.
That I want you to take me home.
Lower. Same page.
Because you have hope that you ll get better?
Landon. I can t even do for myself.
I m no dummy.
I d do that
Please.
For pay?
I d work backstage or something?
When do I get time for me?
Where did you get?
You came here to give me my report card?
Thank you.
Yeah.
A similar triangle?
Scalene?
What do you want, Biff?
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What s the matter, Biff, they re not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don t they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
What do you want, Biff?
Yes, sir!
I beg your pardon?
Uh, yes, sir...
Marty. What s for breakfast?
Dick, what s with those guys out there in the gutter?
Fine.
Oh yeah.
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
How could I forget? Oh, sure, I remember you.
Nine o clock. Oh, I m late! Maybe I ll see you later.
But he didn t ask me.
Eileen, Chinese food again?
How are you?
What drill?
Learn anything?
Well... yeah...
Christ, it s a miracle I was even born!
It was Marty s turn to be confused. Huh?
You re not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
But I ve never picked a fight in my entire life!
I m going to be at the dance.
Why?
Oh. Uh... Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her! George paused. You really think I should swear?
Not a holocaust
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you ll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We ll see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to a lot to see.
You re the only Mr. Lewis in this class. If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don t have a dime all I got is a nickel but you gotta connect me
What?
Operator, what s today s date?
What year?
What?
Dick? Dick who?
I run this place!
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don t take after him.
No way!
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
Hi, Marty!
Well, he s gone.
He said not to tell.
What s going on?
Okay.
Yeah.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Okay.
Yeah.
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch em.
I used to throw trash for the City.
Wouldn t be here if I hadn t.
Thirty aught six.
Mmmmm.
They re okay.
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
Tom...
Thanks.
What d you come out here for?
Is that right?
Well, it s not good enough. Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
What re you doing?
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
Yeah? Why not?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
What s your friend s name?
You love him?
Yeah. I can imagine.
No.
Holly.
What for?
It s okay.
Nah, I got me a job.
What?
Sure.
He ll say that?
Now what s he know about garbage, huh?
There you go.
Well, stop the world.
Great.
Spanish.
Well, I got homework.
I know.
Yeah, but I don t like it.
Just don t... I ve got a headache.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
There s an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
I don t care.
Yeah.
What?
But it would hurt.
How bad off is he?
We better call the doctor... Listen. I ll say how it happened, part I saw.
You said that once already... Too late now.
I m fine. Kind of tired.
How s he doing?
I don t know.
Yeah.
I don t want a steak.
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Positive?
I don t blame him.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there s no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
It was going too fast.
Yeah, then we d be stuck here.
No.
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
Yeah.
I just don t want to go.
Yeah.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Really?
No, of course not. It s only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Well, I d like to leave a message, if that s okay.
Yes?
Just thinking.
Listen, ah... We re going to take the Cadillac for a while. How d that be?
Yes.
Maybe.
Well, matter of fact, I don t have any.
It s mine all right.
Just gimme a chance.
Hold it right there.
Wanta sue me?
How about you? Will you be alright?
Please, Barton.
... I know this must look... funny.
What?! He s a son of a bitch!
He ll wander back when he s sober and apologize. He always does.
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
Hello.
... Who is this?
Yes. Thank you. How s Bill?
It s alright, Barton. You don t have to write actual scenes?
What are they like? What are they about?
You wrote his scripts for him?
You wrote Bill s scripts! Jesus Christ, you wrote his  what about before that?
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
I want to know how many of Bill s books you wrote!
I want to know!
Hah!
That s hamburger grease, Bill.
... Who is this?
... Who?
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
What DID you mean?
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
What else?
W. P. Mayhew? The writer?
It s still a little early for me.
And what would that be, son?
No son, thisahere moonshine s got nothin to do with shuttin folks out. No, I m usin it to build somethin.
Ever act?
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
What!? Ted Okum doesn t know shit. They ve assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn t know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
Okay. I m just having trouble getting started. It s funny, I m blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what s expected 
Nothing. It s just a mosquito bite.
Well I...
Well, to tell you the truth, I m having some trouble getting started 
I m afraid I don t really understand that genre. maybe that s the prob
Well, I ve talked to Bill Mayhew
He s a great writer 
You don t understand. He s in pain, because he can t write
But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He s taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
Well he s taken an interest! That means he ll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he s gonna be all over me too! Fat assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it s going  don t worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line. He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can t read. You gotta TELL it to him tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
To do what?
I m not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
To see pap.
I don t know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I m on the brink of success
No, what did it say?
Yeah, I m fine, Garland  I have to talk to you. I m calling long distance.
I m fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
It s about what I m writing, Garland. It s really... I think it s really big.
Not big in the sense of large  although it s that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I ve done.
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
Yes... Isn t it?
That s all right, really, thank you.
That s okay, I assure you. It s just that I was trying to work 
Well, I m a writer, actually.
Can be. Not easy, but 
Doesn t surprise me at all.
Thanks, I ll keep it in mind.
No, I m actually writing for the pictures now 
That s okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies  though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Well, that s a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Hell, I could tell you some stories 
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
And I could tell you some stories 
Yeah, I guess that s tragedy right there.
Hell no! Jesus, I m the kind of guy, I ll let you know if I m bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I m the kind schmoe who s generally interested in the other guy s point of view.
Charlie. How are you.
Nope.
No... I guess it s something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don t know; I don t really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
Not at all. It s damned interesting.
Beery! You got no beef there! He s good. Hell of an actor  though, for my money, you can t beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don t get me wrong  Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
That s all right, really 
... Yeah, okay.
Hi, Charlie.
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
Well it s... it s a defense mechanism.
Well, it s been better. I can t seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started  I still haven t gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me  my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer. Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
Know about it? I can practically see how they re doin it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
In a few days. Out to your stompin grounds as a matter of fact  New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
I guess the heat s sweating off the wallpaper.
Well...
What do you mean?
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
Don t pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
No!... I m fine. Thank you.
No... Can I come in?
I ve gotta call the police  or you could call for me 
You gotta believe me 
I didn t do this, I did NOT do this 
We gotta call the police 
Yeah.
I don t know! Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don t know. Won t the police be able to 
But I didn t do it  don t you believe me?
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
Everything s okay, believe me. I know it s rough mentally, but everything s taken care of.
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on  just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don t talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we ll figure it out.
I m at the Earle.
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
That s okay, that s okay, that s okay  that s just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We re only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart? Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay. The point is, I run this dump and I don t know the technical mumbo jumbo. Why do I run it? I ve got horse sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don t mean my dick s bigger than yours, it s not a sexual thing  although, you re the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
Great! He s poor, this wrestler! He s had to struggle!
I apologize, Barton.
You don t have to cover for him. It s noble of you, but these things happen in business.
Mr. Lipnik.
Congratulations.
Yes sir, they 
With all due respect, sir, I think it s the best work I ve done.
You didn t let ME down. Or even Lou. We don t live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that s why he s gone. Fired. That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you re under contract and you re gonna stay that way. Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain t no writer, Fink  you re a goddamn write off.
Must be.
Excuse me?
I don t know... I mean, I ll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Well, I m going to be working here, mostly at night; I m a writer. Do you have room service?
What 
Excellent picture.
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won t insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don t wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul  well, all right, a little bit, for the critics  but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don t blame em. There s plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at " Hell Ten Feet Square ".
Did you find out about her parents?
I m fine. Come on, Beth! You know I m fine! How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
It s bullshit. You know it is.
It s been three months.
No.
It s fucked now will you please tell I. A. that I m just you average healthy totally fucked up cop and let me get out of here?
Yeah.
Baby sitting. Rookie cop.
Who?
No, Nick, please
Sometimes I really hate you.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
What was she like in school?
I don t need any help.
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates
What did she tell me, Beth?
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
She didn t hand you to me. She doesn t even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
About a year and a half.
Yes.
Yes.
No. We had a drink at the club. We left together. I came here. He went home.
Are you arresting me?
I don t smoke.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
No.
Why not?
You know all about me.
Four shootings in five years. All accidents.
There s a name from the past.
She wiped out her whole family.
Didn t you study it in school?
I have attorneys. They have friends. I have friends. Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
I wasn t talking about real friends. Why doesn t Gus like me.
Do you?
Don t get too cocky.
You can make a mistake.
Fine.
What if I call you Nicky?
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
There s Pepsi in the fridge.
What s it about?
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
No.
I ll risk it.
Fine. How s your back?
Did you like her to watch?
No.
For what... to set me up? She loved me she wouldn t frame me.
No?
When?
You paid  50, 000 for your character?
What about the other night. What about last night? Was that to get to know your character?
I don t know.
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
I found Lisa Henderson.
No.
I decided to give you one more chance. I missed you.
Did you miss me?
I m very good at research. I ll help you.
What are you researching?
Really. What are you writing about.
What happens to them?
It won t sell.
Somebody has to die.
How did it end?
What is this some kind of... Joke? Are we playing games again?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
He was murdered.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you
Yes I am.
How s that?
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
That s pretty cold, ain t it, lady?
What was the weapon?
Were there ever any suspects?
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Routine.
Do you remember his name?
Nilsen?
Nope. There was some talk; it never panned.
The usual a girlfriend.
Nope. She did. Like I say. It never panned.
I hope I helped you out.
Rock and roll, Gus. Johnny Boz.
Before your time, pop. Mid sixties. Five or six hits. He s got a club down in the Fillmore now.
I didn t know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
She misses me.
What are you doing here, Pop?
I got tired of being played with.
What is it you got between you?
She want to play? Fine. I can play.
I went over last night, too.
I m not gonna get AIDS, pop don t worry about it. I always use a rubber.
You oughta use a rubber, pop. You really should.
You don t like punk rockers?
Why the hell not?
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no. I ain t gettin no back pain disability retirement I m gettin me a full pension and a real gold plate Seiko watch.
I don t believe it.
Catherine told me what was in it.
Don t you get it, Gus? If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine she wouldn t want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley. It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
She s a writer it s part of what she does.
I know what happened. Catherine told me what happened.
I m going with you.
What do you want?
Did you check all four years?
Can there be some mistake?
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
How do you know?
That s the same guy who did this painting.
I didn t see you.
Really?
Out?
Still not here.
Why don t you try letting her in, Steve  I mean Shenge.
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic  writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
SAMO.
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I m doing?
I am... On Gina. Fuck  I didn t think we were actually gonna do this.
About what?
Who s John Henry?
So then what?
He s the best painter in the world. I m gonna give him one of these.
I ain t John Henry.
Good. What do you have?
I guess it was a long time ago.
Me fall? Let s get some drugs!
I guess you did.
Can I walk you home?
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
Party girls? Can I call you?
C mon, baby, I painted them for you. They re beautiful now.
What who s saying?
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
It s Monday morning.
You re blaming me? I had to go see my family.
I hadn t thought about it.
You mean babies with you?
Hi.
He s not. He s out of town and he calls me every day. What s weird about him?
How is he?
What s that about?
Me? Why?
That s great.
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Hi.
You like your dad s paintings?
Wanna Mac?
Have a Mac.
Oh. I didn t know. I ll take you to the best restaurant in town. You ll miss a great meal and I ll keep the scarf, anyway. What s your name?
Life doesn t... make... sense. This city s k killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
No, I don t. I m alone. We all are. Especially here. The world s unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
Can you put me in the ring with him?
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
I didn t know Tony Bennett painted.
Yes, Boss. If you re so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
So what?
What time is it?
Thanks... I ll take it tonight.
I ll make you another one.
A what?
I didn t know.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
I just don t think you re being fair.
It s vichyssoise, sir.
Which is why I hoped you d snub him.
I will relay the message.
" Affair "... yes, maybe... if she...
I m tempted, but... well... it is an occasion for celebration, and... umm... Selina will probably be there...
Hanging on every word.
Wow, a real response and you re not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me... If you re so down on " them " out there, why bust your bat buns to protect em?
I tried to grab you save you
Don t be naive. The law doesn t apply to people like him! Or us
Touring the riot scene. Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Better than you know, Bat boy.
Ah, the direct approach. I admire that in a man with a mask. But you don t really think you ll ever win, playing it your way..?
You mean mistook me?
No. And you don t seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Well, I could... free up some time...
I, ah... didn t catch your last name.
Scare me? No, actually, I was just scaring myself...
And it s not even accurate... I mean, " Batman Blows It "? The guy probably prevented millions in property damage.
I wouldn t be caught dead. No, it s probably how I would be caught. The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot s bait
I detest violence, but... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
" We "? You and...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I d suppose.
Had one. Didn t work.
Nope, I told her everything.
Well... How can I put this. There were two truths... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because I had trouble reconciling them. Vicki said.
Photojournalist.
Nor I, on the second.
' S okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
Y mean take off our costumes?
Same here. So why d you come tonight?
Jesus, Selina, you re not the judge or the jury... I mean, just who do you think you are?
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows
Max, I m gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here. So
Scared of Oswald, are you? Why, if his parents hadn t eighty sixed him you two might ve been roomies, at prep school!
Course you re feeling fine... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
It does to me.
Your blood, Max.
Sorry, Max. A die for a die.
He is Batman, you moron.
Down, Oswald. We have to talk. You see we ve got something in common.
Batman. The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Well, a plan is forming... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life...
I wouldn t touch you to scratch you.
She jumped. She d been depressed.
The Christmas Eve of Destruction!
Silent night, violent night...
But who could ve... no, don t say it.
My god... it s true. The Penguin Man of the sewers... Please, don t h
No, just give you a splitting headache.
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows I know. But someone s got to supplant our standing in the way of progress Mayor and don t deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you ve got the magic!
We need signatures. To overturn the ballot. I can supply those, Oswald.
Oswald: We need one more thing.
That s fine, Oswald. But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
Sidetracked? Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded...
Not Chip! Please! Penguin... If you have one iota of human feeling, you ll take me instead.
I m the one you want! Penguin, please! Ask yourself: Isn t it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you? Isn t it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
I m no cat. I m just an assistant. A secretary
That s my name, Maximillions. Don t wear it out, babe, or I ll make you buy me a new one.
I damn well better be. In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them
Uncle Alfred left for America. Much to my mother s dismay
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success. As one grows older, one yearns for family.
Too late for what, dear child?
What is it?
In spirit only, I m afraid.
Perhaps the truth is you don t really trust anyone.
Alfred, am I pigheaded? Is it always my way or the highway?
Alfred, I know you re sick I can get you the best doctors.
Attending to heroes? No sir. My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
What seems to be the problem?
That, sir, does not compute.
Specify, please.
Pheromones?
Oxbridge Academy?
Hey, I m the one who kicked Ivy s botanical butt. Personally. Me. I did.
Keep it.
Hey, what s your problem?
You d be surprised.
What are you talking about?
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Alfred s happy here.
Crimefighter s rule number one: never say that.
I m afraid to ask.
What exactly are you doing?
Damn? Damn is not good.
Nightwing. Scourge of darkest evil.
Mr. Freeze.
The new antiquities exhibit. The Second Sun of the Sudan.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
I know. The feeling just vanished.
Bad, yes. Guy, no. This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Me too. Great stems, though.
Can he save her?
What are you talking about?
She knows who we are.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
Actually, I already work for you. Or did. Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
I see you knew him.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat. No coolants to preserve food. Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
I can t. But perhaps tonight, over dinner... I ve just had an opening.
Umm. What I mean is... no plans at the moment...
What? I m sorry. You were saying...
I know you re a dedicated bachelor. That you ve had a your wild nights.
But there s nothing you ve done under the cover of darkness I couldn t learn to understand.
What?
Well... um... her.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re emerges as a psychotic super villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
Whoa, I made a mistake. I m sorry. Don t go all protective on me. It won t happen again.
But he s never said a word
Talk to him, Bruce. There s nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
Yes. But Alfred s condition is less severe. Freeze s research says he cured a case like Alfred s. It just doesn t say how.
I m late for the dedication. Then I go after Freeze and Ivy. Alone.
Dick, don t push me right now.
Yes! Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it. That s the whole point. Look at us. Orphans. Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family. We re perfect targets. She s done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
She s clouded your mind. You re not thinking straight.
Her name is Pamela Isley. I saw her talking to Gordon. She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal
She s infected us with some kind of pheromone extract
She wants to kill you.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70 s. But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing. So I m here to set you free.
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
Fine. While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair. She s frozen in
Where is my wife?
Can t we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
As a team, the duncely duo protect each other. But the Robin is young. Impetuous. If I could get him alone
The way to a boy s heart is through his ego. What strapping young hero could resist his very own... signal?
I want us to be together. But I need to know you re serious about turning over a new leaf. I need a sign.
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Tell me and I ll kiss you.
I ve got to stop him.
What do you mean?
Then you never loved me?
Our work?
I think they re getting worse.
Then you d have nothing to complain about.
A few hitches sir, but I m confident we ll have a prototype in no time.
She has an excellent mind.
I wonder if she d go out with me.
Your parents wake. Rain fell like tears.
I don t know, sir. Your dear parents. Suddenly gone. So much loss...
Ninety three, including the sauna.
What did you say?
No. You said I. I killed them.
Is he all right?
He ran away?
He boosted the Jag? Is that all?
The  Rolls ?
Which  they might that be, sir?
Why, indeed?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
Not that young. It s been a long time since you ve called me that.
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
Perhaps the fall...
What?
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
What?
But 1, 3, 1, 8,  5. What do they mean?
Recognition, of course.
Of course. 13 is M.... MRE.
Mystery.
Enigma.
Claw Island. Nygma s headquarters. I m sure that s where they re keeping Chase. Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
How ya doin, Al?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What s back there?
Just checking, young sir.
I m flattered. Not every girl makes a super hero s night table. You might have some interesting insights into Two Face.
Let s just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
What s wrong?
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
It s the car, right? Chicks love the car.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
My life s an open book. You read?
We could give it a try. I ll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
For  me ? Really? Tell me.
Oh please. You re blind as a bat.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
What? Ah yes. Of course. I m sorry. It s just that... you re my idol. And some people have been trying to keep us apart.
Wait. You can t go.
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party
Nostrovia.
Slanta.
Just ones this beautiful.
She s a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams. Need one?
Wacko? That a technical term?
So what you re saying, this guy s a total wacko, right?
So, this Riddler, he s dangerous?
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
You understand obsession better than you let on.
That s usually my line.
Would you? I m not so sure.
Excuse me.
I don t get you Bruce Wayne.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn t it?
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
Well, I met someone...
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang. I think he felt it too.
What?
And now....
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
I d say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
What?
I m not
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
So how goes your  scholarly pursuit of Batman?
I don t want to remember!
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren t responsible.
What?
What are you talking about?
Excuse me.
I got no place at the circus without my family. I m going to get a fix on Two Face. Then I m going to kill him.
Absolutely not.
You don t understand. It s an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain s back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice. I want better for you.
You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What s a good side kick name?
... I missed Two Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
Bruce, you can t.
Who is it?
How could I forget?
Can t tell if you don t say please.
Paranoid? The psychotic?
... Fired... your fired... your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
... You gonna kill me?
I got family.... Please.
Please. I swear I won t say noth
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr.. uh... Face.
You  are  Two Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi zonal, bi coastal needs...
A man with a death wish.
About what?
I d say about thirty feet, sir.
Which bathroom is that, sir?
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
Upstairs. He s quite docile.
Don t ever say that, sir. Don t ever believe it.
Take me. Let the boy go.
What are you talking about?
... Murderer...
I know. I called them.
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I m keeping those pictures.
How do I know you won t keep them all?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
Better. It s not on the market yet.
I loathe bats.
That can t be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We d all be dead.
I don t want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
You could ve killed him, you know. You could ve killed the Joker.
Bruce Wayne. I ve read your work. I quite like it.
What is it you want?
I can t do that. Not while the Joker s still at large.
Tell me, Knox. If you ve got the story, why haven t you printed it?
Yeah, a drink. Civilized, right?
As far as I know.
That s a tough one. Have you ever seen combat?
Neither had I. Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
Well. A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice. And at nights they had a band I danced on the hotel patio. Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn t look away.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
I ll take you home if you d like.
Maybe we should just kiss.
I said I d call you the minute I got free. And I did And here we are.
Yes, Bruce I m here
Well, Bruce I don t think that would be possible.
... I know it s you, Bruce. I m not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
No one would miss me.
You re one man. You can t save everybody.
Finding out where she is.
What now?
I m frightened of you, Bruce. I m frightened for you.
Ohhhh... You don t mean that.
He ll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
Then for God s sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
WHAT?
Sorry. We had another bat sighting.
What are you talking about?
What are you, scared of heights?
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right? No big loss.
Gimme a break, will you? Shut up.
Jack? Thank God. I can t believe it s you. I heard you d been
I ve considered that possibility.
Nobody wants a war, Carmine. If we can t do business, we shake hands and part friends.
I d like to read a prepared statement. While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace. '
Ten million dollars. Ten mi YOU CHEAPSKATES! I ve just wiped out the stock market. I ve cost you billions! I want ten million and one.
A girl could get killed so they tell me. What s new and hot in Gotham City?
Evildoers, huh? Big or small?
Our next D. A. I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser. Did you get your invitation yet?
All aver the world. They say he s spent half of his life overseas.
Likes to kill? KNOX Women find him magnetic.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
What were you thinking?
Oh, Bruce...
Yeah? According to this, he s in Geneva from 76 to 79. Well, I called Geneva. Nobody there s even heard of the guy Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
Everybody needs a hobby. You explain it, Vicki. He walks out on his own party. Half an hour later, who turns up? Batman. Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway. No place to change.
Right. And they know him. And that s why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for
Allie, he s not.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that And he let me keep.
Yeah. Deja vu.
You okay?
God yes, Allie. I ve gotta say that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Sounds great. Excellent. Though, Ahm... there s this guy who s coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
And they asked me if we d like to... you know... put him up for a while.
Yes, there are hotels. They just thought maybe it d be nice for him to stay with a real American family. Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
Ahm he s male. He s English. He s a doctor of er... at least 2 things. I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf. Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time. I think we re looking at someone moderately normal here.
Did you really ask?
David, I m serious!
Hi..... Roses.
Great. You said you d ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else. Did you?
Meaning?
Sorry, honey he just happened to tag along.
It was nothing. We re not... He just makes me laugh. When was the last time we laughed? Any of us?
Annie, it s me.
Right first time.
Ahm.....
Oh dear.
Yes. I 11 mention it to him. But... he s kind of his own guy, you know?
She s... well, she s good.
Yes, isn t he.
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this. I m sure we haven t been doing as badly as all that.
Yes. Ahm. I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Love to, sir, but no can do. No spare room. Period.
And that s where you introduce me to the Governor.
Thank you, sir. Although, I m afraid I don t quite see how we can...
I beg your pardon?
I m er... sorry if you ve been waiting a long time.
I thought perhaps as Vice President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance s for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS...
Very pleased you ve taken him in, David. At a time when no one s job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
Glad to hear it. Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
... you have to sack me. I understand, sir. I ll go quietly. In fact I ll go right now.
Ahm....
I m fired? Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
And a car.
A car sounds sensible.
What makes you say that?
Richard Burton was very good looking.
It s you and Mom that need to talk.
Sure did.
Well, Michael Bolton s pretty grisly.
That s one way of looking at it. You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain.
She was wearing a helmet. It could have been worse.
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint. Going on To my regiment / s reunion after.
Why thank you sir.
I am sorry you feel that way.
NO, seriously I know he s your boyfriend, but there s something about his upper lip that is so weird. What do you think it is, Dad? Jen says it s a moustache, I say it s a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
Nope.
Of course he is.
Yeah, but check it out. It s gone!
What?
No it wasn t!
What s your problem Beavis?
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We ll do your wife.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we re gonna get a big screen TV! Heh heh.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
And Boot Head.
Me first!
My butt s bothering me!
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Yeah, it s just the same thing over and over again.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Uh... I think you scared them off.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Huh? Huh huh.
C mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It ll work.
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You re too much of a butt monkey. Huh huh.
Butt dumpling...
Dill wad...
Butt snatch...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Uh... butt snatch...
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Yeah, we re gonna score.
Yeah, I m hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
You ll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I ve had two operations on my heart.
Oh, maybe you re lactose intolerant.
Why it s you two. How d ya do in Vegas?
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas room shortly before we arrived.
Ah, the witness?
I see it. I don t get it.
Cut the power!
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
That s better. Yes?
D. C., Chief.
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn t have...
Where are his pants?
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
Well, then you know what I m talking about. Anyway, here s the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Uh, ten uh...
No, Jane.
We re rich in what really matters.
So do I, Jane. I m on vacation.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it. You ve finished the streets?
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Oh, honey, I m so glad we re spending our vacation at home.
I know... I just wish she d leave us alone.
Don t forget the balls, Ernie.
Yeah it turned out okay. We applied for a National Historical plaque for it. That ll be the third one on Main Street.
Slow down there, honey... I don t want the vibration to weaken the model.
How s your arm?
I am sitting.
Two hours.
That s how long you were gone.
De ceased. I don t know where it came from.
This book isn t arranged that way. What do you want to know?
I can t clean anything. The vacuum is out in the garage. I can t leave the house. Why don t they tell us something? Where are all the other dead people in the world? Why is it just you and me?
In heaven there wouldn t be dust on the wallpaper.
Dishes? We haven t eaten in three weeks! Adam, I m not like you, I really need to be around people, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
What s she doing here?
Won t? Or can t?
Arrogant. That s Jane Butterfield all right...
They make gypsies look good.
I don t know if there s anything we can do.
You left me.
You can t say that for sure. It could be a transitional thing. Like a post life crisis. We just have to be tougher with them. Come on. Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
She couldn t have. We can t make them see us.
We re not going to wait here like cornered animals. I can tell you that. We need help. I m going to talk to that little girl.
We don t know who he is...... I m going to talk to that little girl.
I don t know... what are you looking up?
Look at this, everything is different down here. All our furniture is gone.
Where are your skulls and bones?
She s got photos, Barbara.
Of course I did.
I didn t do that one... Hmmm.
Three times. Powerful number.
Go? What d ya mean? We need help.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
The sushi? I did the wine. Didn t you do the sushi?
He might have hurt somebody.
Little black party dresses?
Let s see if she can get my model back.
3: 30 I guess.
I m not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are sheets. Are you gross under there? Are you Night of the Living Dead under there? Like all bloody veins and pus?
We were trying to scare your mother.
I certainly did. I d finish it too, but... I don t get out much.
We want to frighten you away. So that you ll move out.
Uh uh. Only if you got above a C on science.
We tried.
We have to start simpler, is that it?
Never trust the living! We cannot have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
Are you Juno, our case worker?
What do you mean? What s he do?
Our cemetery?
About what?
You re not gross. Why were you wearing a sheet?
No, Lydia, we re dead.
No you don t! No... Lydia... Why?
That s right, Jane. Complete vacation.
No! Jane, it is 6: 45 in the morning!
Jane, don t send photographs of our house around the country! We re not interested in selling.
And live in what, our station wagon?
He s a cloven hooved beast!
At least insofar as we have our first casualty. Me.
What s he going to do? Viciously rearrange their environment?
Let s hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I ve bought options on property all over town. I need Max s financing...
Why not?
Stepmother. She s out torturing the movers.
Stepmother.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Yes. Except when you creep around in your mother s
... sheets.
Lydia, I don t know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but
I cannot believe this.
I can t bring the ghosts. They re not here!
Then we own a whole town full of nowhere.
No listen... we ll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
Any particular kind?
I told them you were too mean to be afraid.
It wasn t a joke.
Shhhh. They didn t commit suicide.
The rest of the house is probably worse. When can you and I get started?
You read my mind! I love clients who can read my mind. I don t think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
Viridian?
That s Charles study. But you don t have to even look in there. He ll love whatever you do to it. He s such a sheep.
Attic space.
Maybe Charles does.
No! Do not encourage this little... person.
Yes, but I m going to live at home.
It s okay. How s the dirt business?
I understand. I ve seen it done before.
Yes. I think so, too.
Oh, fine.
... Straight out?
Claim...?... Oh, claim, that s what Thomas asked me.
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Yes.
There s no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
Thank you.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
It s fine today, Robert.
No, Robert.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o clock.
Hell yes walk. You re meeting the President, aren t you?
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
In a day or two, yes.
... You ve become quite a close friend of Eve s haven t you Mr...... Chance...?
I see...... And you are really a gardener, aren t you?
To everyone, I m afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
It s not good, Ben I m sure you can feel it.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Stay here? Is that necessary?
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
He s very intense, and internal, don t you think?
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
... But he s...?
I don t think so, he should be along soon...
You really care for him, don t you, Eve?
I have no idea...
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
I see. Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There s no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
No sir, I don t believe I do.
Yes, sir.
There s no need for a hospital.
Yes. I am.
Yes. He s a very careful driver.
It s feeling better, but it s still very sore.
Your family doctor?
I agree.
My name is Chance.
No. I m a gardener.
No, Eve. I m not related to Basil and Perdita.
Yes. I lost my remote control.
Yes.
No. It won t do that.
Thank you, Eve I like this house very much.
Ben is very ill, Eve I ve seen that before.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
Hello, Eve.
Yes. It s feeling much better now.
Fine. He s very nice.
Yes.
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
Yes. I was.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
Our greenhouse.
Hello, Eve.
Thank you, Eve.
How is Ben feeling?
That s good. I like to watch, too.
No, thank you.
I see.
No, Eve. I don t read the papers.
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
Yes, Eve. I m very glad that you didn t open.
Yes. That could be true.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
I like to watch.
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes. It s very good, Eve.
Hello, Sid.
No. I m not busy.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
I see.
Yes. It s a very good show.
I agree.
Ben is very ill.
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
Yes, I understand.
We are not far...... our chairs almost touch.
I certainly do.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Oh, good.
Yes, it is. Would you tell me your name again, please?
Yes. I like that name very much.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
I agree.
Yes. I am very hungry.
Oh. When you say Your house has been closed, you mean to say that your business was shut down?
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
But I don t have that any more...... All that s left for me now is the room upstairs.
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I m sure you ll have plenty to say in a few days.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
You re looking much better today, Ben.
I understand.
I see, Ben.
Yes, Ben he is.
No, Ben.
I understand.
Thank you, Ben.
Senator Rowley s widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it s rather obvious that Robert won t allow me to attend, so would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
Oh, I see.
A flower...
Yes. I would like to do that.
I like to watch.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
I want to tell Eve.
Yes.
Hello, Ronald.
I can t write.
I can t read.
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Yes.
Yes. Of men and women.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
I agree.
I ve never ridden in an automobile.
... Yes. You can take me.
No but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
Yes sir, I guess that s true smallest room in the house.
I see.
He s dead, Chance! The Old Man s dead!
Must of happened durin the night, I don t know... Lord, he wasn t breathin and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance that s doin more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn t any too alert. He just said, Yeah, he s been expectin it and said he d send somebody over... Lord, what a mornin!
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
Yes, I m very hungry.
Yes.
Yes.
You re welcome.
Yes. That is surprising.
I hope so.
No. I don t object.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Yes.
Yes. I m waiting for my lunch.
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
I see...
I live here.
Yes. It s very cold outside today, isn t it, Thomas?
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
No.
Compensated...?
No, I do not have any of those.
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
I m fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
But you won t sign, correct?
Very well, Mr. Chance if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
Yes, I will.
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won t you?
... Nothing.
Try again.
Try again.
Tired... And I m getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I m doing very well.
No, it s been a good day better than yours, from what I ve been told.
I may be a shut in, but I do not lack for news. I m sorry you had to go through all that.
Reasonable? Good, I d like to meet a reasonable man. Why don t you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
... Yes, I am, Ben.
Good evening, Wilson.
Yes, ma am.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
I really don t know, Tom he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he s quite charming...
... It s very bizarre I don t know what to think...
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
Sally Hayes is not a bitch she s a damn fine attorney! I ve got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
Look, Johanna...
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F. B. I. nor the C. I. A. has met with success.
Clearly, yes comrade.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
Yes, sir we are aware of all that, but still, we haven t been able to...
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
No, sir.
Right, Chief.
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand s home... and, uh...
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt s sources, Chief but it isn t pertinent.
Well, sir it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh... don t quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we ll keep on top of it, Mr. President we ll come up with the answer.
Oh? What?
Good. Anything else?
That could be possible...
A coup d etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
Thank you, Colonel.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
I m not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
Yes, I did.
Overall pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it s very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
It s that serious, huh?
I m sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Take care of yourself, Ben.
Okay.
Oh yeah, he s good.
Yeah.
The one where you re that jewel thief.
Who am I thinking of?
I m pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It s for.... oh, what the hell, it s for me! I m your biggest fan!
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else s body for fifteen minutes.
Tell your friends.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Craig, listen, honey, I ve been thinking... maybe you d feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Craig, everyone can t be Derek Mantini. Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
The monkey.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
We have to make it an early night.
Hmmm.
She s very beautiful.
Hi.
Nah. I m not hungry. I m sorry I didn t call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
I m sorry. How was your evening?
The ferret?
Right.
Yeah. You want a beer?
All right. I ll be in my workshop for a little while. I ll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little. I ll be in soon. A little while.
Brain. soul, I m telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We re going to be rich.
What?
Well, you know we re going to be very busy tomorrow. I ll tell you what. Let s do it tonight. Right now.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
You weren t you. You were John Malkovich.
I ve been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing. I ve decided I m a transsexual. Isn t that the craziest thing?
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I m going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You re right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
I m moving. Remember? What s with the hooded cloak?
You should feed your animals. They re looking peaked.
What?
No they re not.
You ve always loved the animals.
What s that?
Fuck Maxine.
Yes.
We love her, Craig. I m sorry.
Me and John.
Life is confusing, isn t it?
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
It ll never happen, fuckface.
What s that?
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
Yeah but I didn t do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
That s true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
Perhaps you re right. I can t let you go though. Too much has happened. You re my ace in the hole.
I m sorry. Oh God, I m sorry. I m some kind of monster. I m the guy you read about in the paper and go, " he s some kind of monster. "
I m so glad you re safe. You look really wonderful.
He s a lucky man. Do I know him?
The iguana?
Oh, right. As long as you re happy. I m sure he s a better lover than I ever was.
I m sorry for everything.
You came up here looking for the portal?
And yourself too in the process. God, you re so beautiful. Why couldn t I see that before?
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it s all over, I guess.
You ll have me, after all I ve done to you?
I m through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
I d like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
Holy shit, yes!
Simulates?
Let me try.
That... was... no... simulation.
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Schwartz.
Schwartz.
My name is Schwartz.
Yes?
I said " yes. "
I am a trained performer.
No, it s okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
Well, sir, I m an excellent filer.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I m afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you ve read her memoirs, " I can t understand a word any of you are saying. "
Pity, it tells it like it is. That s why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won t touch it. That s a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think. I apologize if you can t understan a word I m saying, Dr. Schwartz.
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I ve been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You re hired. Any questions?
I wasn t toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
I ll keep that in mind, sir.
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
Dr. Lester, it s been really fascinating, but I m afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
Yessir.
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see. Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
Ah. yes, the little door. There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you ll just make it.
More beet spinach juice, my friend?
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
And what sort of business will this be? If you don t mind my asking.
Dr. Lester, I don t know what you re talking about.
You re insane.
Yes. Unfortunately it s bullshit. The real story of 7 1 / 2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Well, truth is for suckers, isn t it?.
How dreary to be Somebody / How public like a Frog / To tell one s name the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
You know, I ve been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover up. I think you re on to something.
No, really.
I just wanted to say  hi.  Did you know I still don t know your name or where you work?
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
Great. Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn..... Muhhhahhhhh..... ahhhnnnaaa.. nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll... tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa... nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa..... Mahhhhhkkkkk... sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
I m right?
That s incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It s kismet. Maxine! It s a beautiful name. There s a psychic connection. Don t you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
Just.
You married?
The usual, Barry.
My tits?
You re a fag or a liar.
You re not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Yikes.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
What s he been in?
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Good. We ll sell tickets.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
Fine. I ll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it s more money for me.
Sure. It d be fun.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
I don t think so. I ve fallen in love. This is what people who ve fallen in love look like.
You re evil, Maxine.
Hello. Wendy.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it s against floor policy. and I discovered that there s a little tiny door in here. Isn t it cute? It s almost like a little dolly s door. I wonder what it  s for.
I m glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I m tired of your nagging. I m tired of this conversation. I m tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
Yes. I m the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
Can I be anyone I want?
Well that s perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I m a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I ve tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
And as I said, sir, we can t very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Didn t mean to imply that you were, sir.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
The kid s got talent. You ve never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can t kill him.
A scary dream?
No, for God s sake, I just watered it yesterday. It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
Maxine says she ll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he s been challenged to a puppet duel by Mantini.
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
But I think I have another plan.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini s performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Fine. Let s drop it.
Fine. I m not mad. Let s just drop it.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Fork ah did?
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Think, Jew florist?
Do we get to wear a crown?
Count me in.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
No you mustn t, my child.
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
No, you don t understand. I ve been inside Malkovich when I m with Maxine...
No, I didn t know that.
No.
It s Craig in there, I can tell.
Why not? I need to get in there!
That bastard! I ll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
I love you, Lotte.
I have to see you.
Really? Well, you know, he s quite good. I m surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I ll speak with you soon.
Did you see the reviews?
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Say... " Equus "? It s got everything.
Broadway s finest three hours. It s about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy boy.
Great then.
No.
Mr. Malkovich?
You don t know me, but I m a great admirer of yours.
Do you mind?
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Lotte called me.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
I ll say you are. Let s do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
Yeah. I ve figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it s all in the wrists.
You mean with Malkovich?
You see, Maxine, it isn t just playing with dolls.
No! But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn t have access to our product?
No! Please! Shut up, will you? We re trying to think here. It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world s most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We d wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
Oh, darling. It s a dream come true. We re going to ride this straight to the top.
I ve got to leave Malkovich.
Beloved.. She s mine I am Beloved
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YES.
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
Baby, don t be like that.
Don t talk like that. Your mama loves you.
Don t say those things. You forget about those dreams..
Mama told you I d give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby... My children my best thing. You my best thing!
We don t have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Don t pay to complain.
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn t gotten out of bed since that day.
Yes?
Haven t seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but.. I don t think so. Mama thinks she s gone for good. Says she can feel it.
I don t. I have my own.
Yes sir
May I come in?
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Oh.
I m looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
Yes ma am.
Yes ma am..
Yes ma am.
I miss her.
Ya think?
Fine. But what would I do at night?
In case of what?
OOh, yeah... Don t know if it s the floor or the skating.
No, let her rest.
I ll make sure she does. But first I m going make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Hold back Denver I m fine.. You.. you go on upstairs. I ll do the cleaning up.
Mama... Mama she s asleep. Why don t you eat something.
Yeah. Look bad?
Devil s confusion. What s this I hear about you not getting out of bed? I saw Denver. She tell you?
You got to get up from here, girl.
Don t you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
She left me. She s gone again.
Don t talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don t say nothing to me this morning.
Make it the way I always do.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Wasn t this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
What do you think?
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Why me, man?
So he thinks it s the carpet pissers, huh?
Uh huh.
Oh, man, don t say that..
Shit.
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs. Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
You don t know shit, Lebowski.
What are you, some kind of sad assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
I m not a ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
She s not my special lady, she s my fucking lady friend. I m just helping her conceive, man!
Who re you working for? Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
The? Who the fff
Yeah, it sucks.
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
Come and get it.
Come and get it. Fucking nihilist.
Nothing.
Hey man, don t you have something else you could put it in?
That is for the urn.
Yes, so we were informed. However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
I m going home, Donny.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
Were you listening to the Dude s story?
Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
What the fuck is he talking about?
Donny, shut the f when do we play?
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don t roll on shabbas.
I m shomer shabbas.
Walter, if you can t ride in a car, how d you get around on Shammas
They were Nazis, Dude?
Uh huh.
No
We ll be near the In and Out Burger.
Fuck you man! You don t like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
Yes, uh, very impressive.
I m not really, uh.
Uh huh.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Lebowski on the right?
He s handicapped, huh?
Far out.
Nancy s pretty good.
Are these.
Different mothers, huh?
I guess he s pretty, uh, racially pretty cool
I see.
Jeez. Think he s got room for one more?
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings
Smoking thai stick, breaking into the ROTC
What s your drink, Dude?
I wouldn t know, Dude. I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and
Uh huh. Well, I still jerk off manually.
I thought you might know, man.
Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties. If I can find your money, man what s in it for the Dude?
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Relax, man! No physical harm intended!
Irish m What the fuck are you talking about? My name s Da Fino! I m a private snoop! Like you, man!
Yeah man.
In a sense, yes. Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal. Which bothers some men. The word itself makes some men uncomfortable. Vagina.
Yes, they don t like hearing it and find it difficult to say. Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his " dick " or his " rod " or his " Johnson ".
Yes, I know about it. And I know that you acted as courier. And let me tell you something: the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Sex. The physical act of love. Coitus. Do you like it?
You re not interested in sex?
I like it too. It s a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word. Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
He fixes the cable?
I m getting to your rug. My father and I don t get along; he doesn t approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don t approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father s embezzlement a police matter, so I m proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1  of the recovered sum.
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
Here s the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you. You will receive no bill. He s a good man, and thorough.
No it s fine, really, uh
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
Hey man, why don t you fucking listen occasionally? You might learn something. Now I got
Now I got
I m telling you, I got definitive evidence
The main guy, Dieter
Well yeah, I guess
Beaver? You mean vagina? I mean, you know him?
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Look, Jeffrey, you don t really kidnap someone that you re acquainted with. You can t get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
So Dieter has the money?
Do you still have that doctor s number?
Delayed after eff
Uh huh.
Oh?
Uh huh.
What do you do for fun?
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder s fee.
He thought I had your father s money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
It s a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs. Fortunately I ve been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber. I m real fucking close to your father s money, real fucking close. It s just
Huh? He s fucking loaded.
But your father he runs stuff, he
But he s
Well yes, what did you think this was all about? Fun and games?
I want a child.
Look, Jeffrey, I don t want a partner. In fact I don t want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who ll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
Yeah man, it really tied the room together
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can t go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my
Jeff Lebowski. Come on. This other Jeffrey Lebowski. The millionaire. He s gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two... And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug. Am I wrong?
Am I wrong!
You re fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Huh?
What the fuck re you talking about? The carrier. What s in the fucking carrier?
What the fuck are you
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
First of all, Dude, you don t have an ex, secondly, it s a fucking show dog with fucking papers. You can t board it. It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Hey Walter
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point. Not in Nam, of course
You mean beyond pacifism?
No, you re not wrong
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
Well, just take t easy, man.
Yeah? Wavin a gun around?!
Huh?
Twenty grand. And of course I still keep the rug.
What if it s during a game?
I don t see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
Walter, face it, there isn t any connection. It s your roll.
It s your roll
My dirty undies. Laundry, Dude. The whites.
Thaaaat s right, Dude. The weight. The ringer can t look empty.
Well you re right, Dude, I got to thinking. I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million. Am I wrong?
What the fuck is going on there?
Easy, Dude.
Shutup, Walter! Don t fucking say peep when I m doing business here.
Terrific, Walter. But you haven t told me how we get her back. Where is she?
Yeah. That s a great plan, Walter. That s fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly. That s a Swiss fucking watch.
What d he say? Where s the hand off?
Huh?
Well call them up and explain it to em, Walter! Your plan is so fucking simple, I m sure they d fucking understand it! That s the beauty of it Walter!
I m throwing the money, Walter! We re not fucking around!
Fuck that! I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you re gonna have to face the fact that you re a goddamn moron.
Your wheel, Dude! I m rolling out!
Your wheel! At fifteen em pee aitch I roll out! I double back, grab one of em and beat it out of him! The uzi!
What the fuck is that supposed to mean? What the fuck re we gonna tell Lebowski?
What the fuck re you talking about? That poor woman that poor slut kidnapped herself, Dude. You said so yourself
I told that fuck down at the league office who s in charge of scheduling?
Who s got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
Hmm. Well, we were in a handicapped spot. It, uh, it was probably towed.
Well, certainly that s a possibility, Dude
Whose toe was it, Walter?
The nail polish, Walter.
Someone else s where the fuck are they gonna
But Walter
They re gonna kill her, Walter, and then they re gonna kill me
What about the toe?
All right, I m leaving. I m sorry ma am.
Now that is ridiculous, Dude. No one is going to cut your dick off.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Dude
Now Dude
Huh?
And let s also not forget let s not forget, Dude that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city that isn t legal either.
No, I m
We re sympathizing here, Dude
The In and Out Burger is on Camrose.
Huh?
Who the f have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
All but one man died? There at Bitter Creek?
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
The bulk of the series.
Not exactly a lightweight.
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
Look, man, did you
Is the car out front yours?
Oh, for Christ s sake, Walter!
And the fucking money!
Dude?
I can t drive, Dude, it s erev shabbas.
Erev shabbas. I can t drive. I m not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it s an emergency.
I understand. That s why I picked up the phone.
Dude, I m not supposed to make calls
Well it s, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
What s your point, Dude?
Yeah?
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
I m saying, I see what you re getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it s shabbas, the sabbath, which I m allowed to break only if it s a matter of life and death
What the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
You know this!
Yeah? What do you think happens when you get divorced? You turn in your library card? Get a new driver s license? Stop being Jewish?
I m as Jewish as fucking Tevye
WALTER, FOR CHRIST S SAKE! HE S CRIPPLED! PUT HIM DOWN!
He can t walk, Walter!
Shit, Dude, I didn t know. I wouldn t ve done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
Uh huh.
Yeah.
No Dude.
Then what s...
Wha.
Wha... Donny
Walter
Dude, I m sorry
Shit!
Who is this?
Yeah?
Okay, vee proceed. But only if there is no funny stuff.
So no funny stuff. Okay?
Right, Dude.
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me. So where do I fit in?
I ll say it again, all right? You told Brandt. He told me. I know what happened. Yes? Yes?
Did I urinate on your rug?
Hello! Do you speak English? Parla usted Inglese? I ll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Hello! Hello! So every time I just want to understand this, sir every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the
You re just looking for a handout like every other are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Are you employed, sir?
You don t go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
But I do work, so if you don t mind
Dude.
I don t know, sir.
Bunny Lebowski... She is the light of my life. Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
Well we I don t
WHAT?!
What in God s holy name are you blathering about?
Well... yeah.
I said out. Now.
Over the line, Smokey! I m sorry. That s a foul.
Excuse me! Mark it zero. Next frame.
Am I wrong!?
YOU THINK I M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
Impressive.
We ll take em in the morning.
He s half yours, partner.
Then they weren t created to go after your " patient zero ".
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
I ll heal.
He escaped. You didn t tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank. He was one of the guard s Nomak attacked.
Right. So why is he dying? He doesn t appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind what s killing him?
If that s true, what about Nomak? He s been alive longer than the others.
Like cancer with a purpose.
You don t have to hunt to do it.
What?
For what?
Why?
It doesn t have to be like that. We don t have to be enemies.
I am a hunter. A weapon. It s what I do. It s in my blood.
Did you think I wouldn t?
Sounds like a plan.
I don t like it.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
Where the hell have you been?
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
So?
Thought you were dead.
He was here. Watching us.
Getting your attention, Paco.
Not that I m in contact with.
No Does that mean I can t be a donor?
Scud.
The pimp mobile? Just made a few after market modifications. Nitrous oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Fuck yeah. Whole package ll crank this betty up another three hundred horsepower.
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
Yeah, but you didn t have the Scudster working on it, did you?
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Blade doesn t talk about the old days much.
You little shit. When did they get to you?
You should ve killed her, then.
Maybe not. I did some checking, she s a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
Listen. You have to finish me off. You don t want me coming back.
How can you be out here?
I don t buy it.
Maybe I don t see it that way.
You re wrong.
Pass.
You re wrong a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won t be able to affect me then.
You re blind
I didn t come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
Who is LaMagra?
" The Blood Tide ".
But I just got here
Because you re tainted. The venom s still inside you. You could still turn on us.
I don t care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don t plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you ll be out of the city by nightfall. If you re stupid enough to stay, that s your business.
Do it. You ll be dead before you can file the complaint.
Figured they d send someone after you. Thought I d wait around and see who showed up.
It worked, didn t it?
Why in God s name would anyone want to work for them?
And that s a good thing?
There is no cure.
What do you see here?
How can you tell?
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Some kind of archive
Those aren t real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
Some. It s been slow
I ve been better
I m not leaving without you.
I know. Take some of my blood.
You re a week early.
I was afraid that might happen.
Deacon brought me back.
These are my people now. I m one of them.
I don t believe that.
Then what is it?
It s not a joke. I ve got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that s all I ask.
What?
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we ve had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won t be necessary after tonight.
The Blood Tide. Our long prophesied holy war against the humans. There s a force, you see a spirit that exists in our blood. I ve discovered a way to invoke it.
You.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that s what the Thirst is really about.
So that s it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
You ve been listening in the whole time?
What happens if he doesn t take the serum?
No offense, Whistler, but you re not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
He killed them?
Their own blood can t sustain hemoglobin.
How?
I don t... I don t understand them myself.
Bad boys, mean boys, cowardly boys just like Domini.
A coward too. That s why she had to go.
Don t know just that she was afraid
Bullshit! Talk!
Yes.
Trying to find the energy.
Any number of reasons pick one, it s as good as the other.
Doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best it meant something was wrong.
Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let s keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow up tomorrow.
Mrs. Leavitt
Let s talk to your husband
Down or off you re giving me a migraine.
Christ almighty
It s called " morning sickness, " asshole
Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
She e mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
Oh, sorry, right.
That s a joke?
What?
Doesn t just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there was a Blair Witch
You sure?
It s a sketch, Anna it s not to scale cartography; the tree was not the kids focus
Whoever they built an entire house around a tree. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
Oh, c mon even you have to admit this is weird.
It was free I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
You know, Nick, you ve been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Like how weirded out you are with this pregnancy thing.
You don t want it though.
Why is there no " our " here?
You feel no need to get married or anything.
You said the name " James. "
I don t know. Nightmare.
I want to see the tapes.
We re leaving case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we re going to graduate with no thesis.
You should get back into bed.
What?
No.
I get dreams. I don t like em.
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
I can t.
Whatever you want.
Why?
I know, I know.
Before 5: 00
Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend
Yeah.
The, uh, blur there.
You have to go.
I can t.
Hunch. Just sort ve saw em there.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
What? That made her lose the baby?
Turn the tapes back on.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
If I could do that, I d be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
Go!
Which d be about ten bucks
That s what Josh and Mike said.
Hadn t even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
What?
Yeah?
No.
No sense at all. I m a little stressed.
Cotter: shut up.
Too busy eating us?
Su casa y shit o hole o.
I got the tape enhanced and I managed to sleaze a photo blow up. Jesus, he s gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he s always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over
Fucking owl!
How s she going to know where to
I saw what I saw.
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with
Hell, I don t think I m ever leaving this place again
For " James? "
I don t trust anybody, not even me, anymore
Who?
What?
Turn the camera off
Graduate Thesis
A Wiccan
I m not finished.
This isn t about us.
No problem, just give us til dawn and we re gone.
Asleep
Spite.
I dunno it s safe to even get out of the car.
Sorry, I didn t think we were making that much noise.
Enough to keep sane.
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
What re you nuts
We re doing dusk till dawn taping of all the places where there ve been alleged Blair Witch " sightings " the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
Ah, Domini?
You planning on sleeping out there?
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
He ll never know.
Still working on it.
What?
That s why she kills children.
Sure. I m sorry.
Get some more beer.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn doctor.
She s off her fucking rocker
I m sorry.
A lot.
Yeah.
Shoot.
Domini.
Or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what else we could have picked up in the woods.
Check the monitor, she s fine.
Anna
I thought all witches were benign and good.
Does she have marks, Nick like the ones we have, that Domini had?
Does she, goddamnit??
There are other explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that s insane!

Meurice
Yeah.
You can stay at my place, I ll drop you there.
See a guy.
What?
I don t know, he didn t say anything.
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
You wouldn t be putting me out.
... Huh?
Yeah? What happened?
... I don t know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
I said, Marty, how come you re anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
Thanks.
... Mm hmm.
... You ever get tired?
Abby... you all right?
I didn t think I could sleep. I m surprised you could. Are you all right?
Ray
What do you want to know?
Remy.
Thanks.
We don t seem to be communicating
I own the place.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
See, Wednesday s the special on RC Cola. I don t know if I explained about the TV option. If there s a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
What?

Uh huh.
Well, I m only an employee, I ain t married to him.
I ll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
See, I never knew that.

Abby, I like you, but it s no point starting anything now.

Well... if you re not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine
You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
How long did you watch her?
Got a job for you.
It s, uh... it s in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
I didn t say that. Well?
What do you think?
For the money.
I want you to go fishing.
Ya catch any fish?
Ya catch any fish?

It s taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
Of course.
Has Ray come in yet?
How would I know?
You said the usual
Right. Sorry.

Jack Daniels. Don t worry, I m paying for it.
What s the point?
No. I think I ll stay right here in hell.

Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Shit. let s drink to something else. let s drink to fuckin. Say here s to your fuck Frank.
Shut up. It s daddy. shithead.

He s a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
Hey. Tits. I m taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
You want to see him too, right?
Those are my breasts.
Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
Nope. it s new stuff. no smell.
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey nothing.
I wanted to see you.
Nobody.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn t mean to do anything but see you.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
Well.
Then you got undressed.
Never before this.
No. Come on.
Look. I m sorry. Just let me leave.
I. I don t know.
No.
Nothing. Are you alright?
No.
Yes.
See my nipples?
Yes, I like you.
Do you know?
No. What is happening?
Please don t talk like that. You re upset. I m not helping you. I m sorry for what I did. I better go.
Then don t talk about killing.
Don t say that.
I looked for you in my closet tonight. It s crazy, I don t know where you came from but. I like you.
Frank?. can you stand up?
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
No.
Don?. Are you in with them?
Who are you? Maybe I ll need to. you like me, huh?
. or do you just want me? I m going to let you enter me now.
I m sorry. maybe I better go Dorothy.
Frank is coming?
I sure don t hate you.
I m doing it.
Whatiya mean?
What do you want?
Yes.
Frank would open you.
Does that scare you?
Beeeee careful.
Do you love me?
Sometimes I think I do.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You put your disease in me. your semen. it s hot and full of disease.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren t so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.. it s burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
There s so much I want to tell you. I m in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It s kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It s opening me to a death.
If I die, then they ll be free. It s getting late, isn t it? I can tell. it s a cold feeling when it s late. It s warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
I did. are you?
Why are you here? Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
I want you to stay with me.
Okay. soon? Do you think I m too fat?
I m getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
It s okay. it s okay.
They hurt his head.
Don?. Where is he?
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
No thanks. what does that mean?
Go where?
Here s to Ben.
What?
Nothing.
Yes.
Okay Frank.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
There ya go.
You were pretty popular. Didn t you run for some office?
Am I bothering you?
Yes.
Terrible. boring.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
That s too bad.
Didn t my father tell you not to talk about it?
I don t really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father s office. The ear. there s no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That s direct from the Coroner s Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There s also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
No. this has been going on for some time. several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
Maybe so.
Yeah. It s close by. that s what s creepy. They ve had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don t know what they ve found out because my father isn t in charge of her.
Where are they?
I don t know. like I said, she s not my father s case.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he s been murdered.
Yeah, I guess so. What are you going to do now that you re home?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
I don t know.
I m here, aren t I?
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it s necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I ll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman s apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help.. Aren t you curious about my plan?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
You will be a Jehovah s Witness. I have a few " Awake " magazines for you. You don t have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I ll need. Whatiya think?
Let s just try the first part. If that goes well, we ll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Alright.
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
I didn t get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn t have time to get a window, but I found this key. Pretty nifty, huh?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
You didn t goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It s Friday. do you have a date tonight?
First of all, we ll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Great. I ll pick you up around eight o clock. Is that good?
First of all, we re going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We ll watch her for awhile. I d like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we ll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Then we ll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
That sounds good.
Why not?
It ll be okay. I don t think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
I m going in, Sandy. I ll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Oh, okay. can I call?
Look. it can wait till Sunday.
Yeah.
Are you sure?
I don t know if you re a detective or a pervert.
Well. I ve found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
He got a little jealous.
. OK. It s a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don s ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the " yellow man ". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don t know what he does but I think he s on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
I don t see how I can. and I can t prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
. Actually. I ve been in twice.
Yes.
Yeah. I mean. a little,. you know.
That doesn t bother you, does it?
That s what I thought.
Yeah I guess so. You re a neat girl.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Goodnight.
I m really sorry.
You want to go talk to him?
That s what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank s building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Oh yeah?
Jeffrey!!
I can t believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Jeffrey?. Why?
You like mysteries that much?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
What is it?
Nothing. really! It s good to see you.
Where to?
I d rather not talk about it. I ll tell you about it sometime.
... You look beautiful.
I can t dance fast.
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
Let s wait for some slow one.
No.
Dorothy Vallens?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
OK. Let s get her over to your father s.
Go ahead.
No Jeffrey!!
Looks like you d make a good runner.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
You can change it if you want to.
Motherfucker works fast.
He what?
No. I have the space. I figured it out. This is what I want to do.
Five thousand per kilo.
Thanks. I am. Where s Martha?
Mama, vos sos bien antigua. Como lo va a matar con un picahielo. Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
What is?
You happy, baby?
What is?
You happy, baby?
Are you kidding?
Yeah, I don t feel so well.
I feel like shit. Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Would you be bummed out if I didn t go to Chicago with you?
Nice first impression. A nose bleed in front of your parents.
Oh, they weren t that bad. I mean, they were kind of cute.
Baby, you didn t have to come.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years. I ll serve two.
What? You re not going to wait for me?
I know it s not the greatest. It s commercial.
Man. Fuck you guys. I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
I know it s not the greatest. It s commercial.
Man. Fuck you guys. I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Yes, I am.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
Excuse me?
I m doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole. Even if they cut my sentence in half I ll be seventy three years old. That s some fucking deal. I don t know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here. I have a really bad record, I m not sure what s going to happen.
What details? I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
What? Yeah, sure.
My clothes, your clothes. What does it matter?
What are we doing here, Diego? This guy s a clown. He s talking about clothes.
It s a lousy fifteen kilos. I piss fifteen kilos.
Excuse me?
I see. How much?
We want some grass.
No.
We re not cops. We re from Massachusettes. I mean, does he look like a cop?
We want some grass.
No.
We re not cops. We re from Massachusettes. I mean, does he look like a cop?
You re kidding, right? That s a hundred pounds a week.
Here s the best part. We can charge five hundred a pound.
Goodness is right. If you do the math, that s over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek. Fifty fifty. That s fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend. In your pocket, free and clear.
It s great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
Nice doing business with you, George.
Yeah. She told me.
I heard.
It s in the past. I m out of the business now, so forget about it. No hard feelings. We need to move on. And besides, I m sorry, too.
For calling you a homo.
What?
I don t want to talk about it.
Not really, no.
I don t like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Murder.
Nothing. Just a little project.
Never mind. Not for you to worry.
You have your intrigues. I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne. In nine months, I am free. How much time do you have?
Twenty six months? For murder? I must be your lawyer.
Only two ways I know to leave here early. One is to escape.
I m tired, Diego. Go to bed.
Good night.
I would if I could get some sleep.
Because I got caught.
Because they caught me?
I don t know, Diego. I ve got a good thing going already. Everybody smokes pot. It s easy. Cocaine is a rich man s drug. It s too expensive.
And that s wholesale. Cut it a few times and retail, you re looking at two, three hundred thousand.
Yes. And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Now do you see what I am saying?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
I don t know. A hundred, hundred and fifty. How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
We ll refuel in the Bahamas. I know someone there.
Allo?
George, hallo! Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
Congratulations, brother. I ve been waiting for you.
Perfect, George. Perfect. Everything is fine down here. Everything is all set up.
I can t go anywhere, Diego. I m on parole. I can t leave the state.
I just got released five minutes ago.
What s the matter? We re moving three hundred fucking kilos and we re making dogshit.
It is bad. It s chump change. We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border. We re getting screwed.
And what happens when these guys stop paying? Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out. Then where are we?
What is it, George? Because I have to get home. I ve got a parole officer waiting for me.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It s been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
I think it s fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
What the fuck is going on? When did you get out of jail?
Yeah. Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Just a friend.
We re half a million off.
Weight it. If it s sixty pounds, it s three. If it s fifty, it s two point five.
George, we ve got sixty one million dollars. It s either here or someplace else. We ve got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
You re a lucky man, Diego.
Shut up, Diego. They re going to be here any minute. I m trying to concentrate.
What do you need my connection for, Diego? What are you going to do with it?
Everything is not alright. I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
What?
No more brothers, Diego.
You fucked me, Diego.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
Coke.
I don t know. Maybe eighteen grams.
Today.
Take your boots off. You re tan.
Yeah. We heard all about it. I want you to know I m deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
Yes, Barbara. She was very pretty.
I ve seen those in magazines. They re not cheap.
I m just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
That s right. Layaway. Something you wouldn t know anything about, you cheapskate.
Actually, it was three.
It would be my pleasure.
Un sapo?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Yes, sir. As much as you can give me.
It s beautiful.
Yes. I do not know, either. What do you want, George?
Yes. Money. Which is what, George?
Power?
Family.
Beautiful girls?
Keep them coming? Ah, yes. Ha ha. You are right. But money.
And Diego?
Yeah, well...
Yeah.
I didn t come here to drink scotch.
You know why I m here. You know what I have to do. I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo. This is bullshit, he s making me look like a punk.
You re saying life will take care of Diego?
I get it. I m really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman s Cay. For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that s fucked up!
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do? You and me, Pablo? Are we good?
That s too bad. You would have been the first one in the family.
Alright. You want me to get your old job back? Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
That s too bad. You would have been the first one in the family.
Alright. You want me to get your old job back? Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
You loved her, didn t you? You really loved her.
Not mad.
I just don t know what you re thinking. I don t understand your choices. You know, the police are looking for you.
Dad.
Yeah. Listen. I m going to be going away for awhile.
No.
Money. You and your mother. All the time chasing it. I never understood it.
That was a beautiful message.
What do you guys want?
Figured what out?
Figured what out?
Hello.
I don t think so.
Why are you smiling?
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Oh, don t be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn t I?
Shhh, honey, never mind. It s alright. It s over. I quit the business. I m out.
She did that before.
Yeah. I know. She did that before.
I said, I ve seen it before.
Can you lift the furnace. I need money.
Please, Mirtha. I ll start working for Augusto. I ll talk to him tonight. I ll do something.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
My problem? We re broke, that s my fucking problem. And you re a fucking spy.
What do you want me to say? I m in prison. You should know. You put me here.
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah, so I ve been thinking. I love her, y know? I kind of want to have her. I ve been away for so long. Make up for the missed time, you know?
Yeah, well. I m working on that. I ve got something going.
Yeah.
Kristina s fine.
Is she here? George, Kristina hates you. You fucked her over one too many times. And I m not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Well, I got a call from Pablo. He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He s giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down. His exact words were " Fuck Diego. "
Are we gonna split up?
Nothing. I just wanted you to know I was out. I just wanted to see you.
How are you doing?
Dad.
You can call me Dad if you want.
Kristina, c mon, I m sorry. I m going to make this right. I ve got a few things going on...
Just to walk with you. I want to be your dad again.
You mean, like a trip?
Yeah.
No. I just kind of like the sound of it.
Where are you going?
You swear?
You know I can t. Mom will never let me go.
But I ve got school.
You swear?
I don t believe you.
Swear on my life.
It s alright, Dad.
Shhhh.
I know, Dad. I love you too.
Not today, George. Time to go back.
Okay, George.
Who s the co pilot?
Sounds fine. I ll need to meet everybody.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent. That s an extra two hundred large.
Very nice. I ll take it.
All of it. As much as you ve got. A couples thousand pounds. I ll be back in a week with a plane.
I don t need a little. I need a lot.
What if I brought you, let s say, fifty thousand dollars? Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
This calls for a joint. You want to do the honors?
G d, I m stoned. I m stoned. I m really...
I wish there was shit like this back home.
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
Sid Ahmed.
Sail.
Second district...
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
Third group.
Don t move, Hacene.
It s true.
They re not paying me anything. They ve already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
Sure. By shooting at me.
I don t even know your name yet...
You weren t able to. But what s important is that you tried.
C mon... you re exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Then don t complain.
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me...
It s too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It s impossible.
It s ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
A name?
Yes, I believe there won t be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
Of course I am.
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
How can I give you this statement?
It could ve happened to anyone.
So where do we start?
You ve got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
You got something on the coke?
So, what good is it to us if it s been erased?
Why?
Joe Koehler. I know him. He s an estate attorney and he s very expensive.
What good does that do it s the old will?
You think the D. A. s gonna file on Joanne?
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
For starters I d like to know why she left the house and didn t report the death?
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
Had to. I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh. There s no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
Cause?
What d he die of?
The official cause?
We know Marsh had a head cold. We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand. The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time. He d keep using more and more never knowing what he was taking.
A massive cardiac arrest.
Very poor. He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
No.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
I don t think so. The membrane in his nasal passage didn t show any sign of long time usage.
Yes.
Yes those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson s.
Increase his heart rate.
It would be an added stress to his heart.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Yes.
Like cats and dogs.
You name it they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
Well he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
Sex.
No never.
Sit down, Frank.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will. That s motive. She admits to being there the night of his death. That s opportunity and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
Take your pole out of the water, Frank. The fish ain t biting today.
She planned this. She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
Because she s clever. Because she knows that even if we didn t find it we d have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh s condition would use cocaine.
The M. E. s report stated that Marsh s nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use. Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning. We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
We re going all the way on this one, Frank. Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two fifteen to twenty five.
Aren t they all?
I m just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
Hey the bell s sounded. It s between rounds.
I m talking to you as a friend now. Don t ruin your life, your career for her. She ll spit you out when this is over.
Really? What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o clock in the morning?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months. I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
I ll rephrase the question. Mr. Roston isn t it true you are bisexual?
I have.
No.
A little after eleven.
I had some papers to pick up.
Rebecca Lawson.
No but I can get it for you.
Six years.
No never.
Yes.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Yes.
Horrible. He was tired and pale.
Yes.
His Secretary. Joanne Braslow.
No. She stopped by to pick up some papers.
We were lovers.
For about one year.
Intense.
It was wild. She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up kinky things. I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
I had bypass surgery.
Fine. The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
It didn t.
She didn t. She just left.
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could. She called it opening new doors.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her. My doctor had warned me about exerting myself but you really don t think of those things at a moment like that. You just think about how beautiful this woman is how much you want her. How deeply you want to please her. At first it started off slowly but the rhythm built and built. Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop. Eventually I started to have trouble breathing. Rebecca just kept going faster and faster. No matter what I said she wouldn t stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
I couldn t help myself. You get lost inside a women like her. It was like a drug. It was the best sex I ever had.
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Who was your primary beneficiary?
At a dinner party about eight months ago.
Yes several times.
We stopped seeing each other.
Yes Insulin and others.
She said that those weren t any good because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned. She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
No.
No.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
And after that didn t you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
I was angry.
No she asked me about cocaine.
That s enough.
Oriental medicine.
Yes. I ve been seeing her for over a year.
Yes.
Chinese peony root.
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
One last question, Doctor. If someone didn t know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
No.
Then those are not your own words?
What changed?
I don t know. It s incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
I really don t know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
I wasn t lookin through the keyhole if that s what you re thinking. I d come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew. I d find their little toys all over the place.
No.
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Yes It was on a Friday. I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday. It would be October twenty eighth.
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him. That his heart couldn t take it.
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving. That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights. Incredible stress.
Well, think about it. Isn t it possible?
He video taped you.
It must have been horrible. Having to go there seeing them together knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
You don t like Miss Lawson much do you?
You don t like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along. Isn t that true?
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh s house?
Yes.
Yes.
She talked him into it. She wanted everything.
Well I m a little confused. This is a charge receipt from Rosen s Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account. It s dated the day of the murder. Is this your signature?
There s an item you picked up that s marked. Will you read it?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
A. M or P. M.?
You see that s what bothers me. No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house. The police looked. There was only the one bottle. But you say you didn t arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death. How do you think it got there?
No.
No! Why would I want to kill him?
Then you would have gotten your money?
Why d you come here?
You didn t know about it before that?
Frank what are you doing here?
You know I can t talk about that.
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
And didn t Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
Yes.
I don t know. That s why I m asking you.
Andrew hardly needed leading. He was a very passionate man. He was eager to explore. I gave him what he wanted. We fulfilled each others needs.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
No pain, no gain?
I thought the subject was sex?
Yes.
I don t know if it s something I can explain to you.
Because it s beyond intellect. It s emotion. It s passion. It has to be experienced it can t be imagined.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
We started talking. In fact, we talked until four in the morning. We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests. After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back. Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I ve never left.
Because, I m your attorney. I shouldn t be going to your house.
I think the photographer s probably a voyeur.
Oh Well, they re different.
It s not my taste.
Hi. It s Frank.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Great. I ll see you at the office at nine.
I hardly know him. He wanted me and he couldn t have me.
No I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Yeah.
I broke my ankle skating. That ended that dream.
What would?
Is that what you think I was thinking?
What?
She s mistaken.
It isn t true. You have to believe me.
I don t use cocaine anymore. If she says she saw me doing it she s lying.
I m glad you have such confidence in me.
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
Fuck him! He tried to shatter mine.
I knew you were thinking that. I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom. You re wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
You re a monster.
That wasn t the deal.
I m not leaving without that tape.
How s it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you but then he s given himself away as your accomplice now he has to kill me. After that I figure she ll tell the Police that you broke in. That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
We ve already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn t even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten. I d like you to go with her.
Why?
Raymond, I m the only criminal attorney you have.
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
Yeah.
Why?
But it s Sunday.
I am relaxing.
Really?
And I suppose you re going to show me how to relax?
We re supposed to go to the lake.
He must have something or he wouldn t be pressing so hard.
I don t know yet. I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Yes.
I ll talk to him later.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I ve got a lot of preparing to do.
We have to talk.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you. You were with her, weren t you?
Why did you lie to me?
I m not.
No.
We can t pretend this isn t happening.
Why didn t you come to me?
You used to like to touch me to make love to me.
It was a place to start.
That s too bad.
Michael, you shouldn t be happy when someone else isn t feeling well.
What time did you leave?
No never.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
We were here two Christmases ago.
It s not that long.
SO!
Oh Jesus.
We re not doing it! I m not even sure it s Christian.
Well, there s a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama s relatives addresses in Italy stuff like that.
No treasure maps, huh?
Mom s orders.
Well, there s a problem.
Michael.
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is... I love you... Robert.
That would be some trick. He s already dead. That s what this other letter is. From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested...
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
' 82.
I don t know. I m completely in the dark here. That s what I get for moving away.
Don t talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a!
Well, what am I supposed to think?
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
"... It s all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don t want to, I suppose that s okay too. But in that case I want you to know something I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It s just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience... "
This is crazy. She waits till she s dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That s enough for me. I don t have to know who she was.
No. We re going to lock this up and
Oh, he did not. He s such a nice guy.
Oh, don t feel sorry for me. Please. No one s forcing me to stay.
Have you called Betty? Maybe you should.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
You mean she didn t like sex?
Boy. All these years I ve resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could ve moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
I never knew that.
Was this during Betty?
Did we want to?
What gets me is I m 46 years old. I ve been in this crummy fucking marriage
For over twenty years because that s what I was taught you stick with it! Normal people don t get divorced. I can t remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ s sake quite frankly, I don t think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
I d kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I d laugh.
Oh, yes.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
They got heat in Michigan.
Heat is heat.
Well, I didn t know they was a secret club.
You want me to call the doctor?
No, of course not. I ll just clean up.
That s it.
No.
Maybe it s because I live here.
Uh huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
After the divorce.
How long you been married?
You don t look like a native, if you don t mind my saying so.
Well, from Italy to Iowa that s a story! Whereabouts in Italy?
Oh yeah, Bari. I ve been there.
Long. You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
No, not at all except those are poisonous.
Want another cigarette?
Francesca.
I m so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
A little place with cabins. The something Motor Inn. I haven t checked in yet.
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don t think. Where s your family?
Oh. How old?
No, your kids.
I guess. Except I m one of the people it frightens.
Why?
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn t know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
Clean?
And clean.
Much.
I feel so embarrassed.
But I... We don t even know each other.
Sure. Men cook. We don t all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
She starts sniffing me.
It s still a very sensitive memory for me.
We got engaged.
Nah. I ve tried. My writing s too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
I m kind of obsessed by it, actually.
I don t know if obsessions have reasons. I think that s why they re obsessions.
No. I wouldn t say that. National Geographic isn t exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don t mind really. I m not artist. I d faced that a long time ago. It s the course of being well adjusted. I m too normal.
I d like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
My children. And Richard didn t like my working.
I don t know. I ve never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you ve ever been to? Unless you re tired of talking about it.
No. It s all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
You get used to it.
You want to go back in?
What?
Umm, I don t know. I can look it up.
No. I ll do them later.
What?
Yes.
What?
Not at all. I wasn t around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
I never got lost. For some reason, I m more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I ll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I m kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it s kind of hard to break.
Never touch the stuff. I ve got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying " This is mine. " or " She s mine. " Too many lines have been drawn. World s breaking apart because of man s weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
I embrace Mystery. I don t know what s coming. And I don t mind.
No.
Not everybody s supposed to have a family.
I told you, I love other people.
No. But I love them just the same.
That s not what you re saying. I know it s not the same. What you re saying is, it s not as good. Or it s not as normal or proper.
I m a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I m just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self cleaning oven and home movie.
What made you ask such a question?
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
Yes! Hi.
No. I was just... No.
The light was fading. Huh huh.
Wonderful. Uh...
Oh, sure. Great.
No. I ll drive myself. I have a few errands. I ll meet you there.
Oh, hi. Look, I m running a little late, but I ll still...
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with " that Redfield woman. " I apologize. I thought you were half joking about that.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage. Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it s just I mean, it s nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or...
Oh, how is he?
Actually, no. I ve got everything under control. I d like to clean up myself a bit. I m going to take a bath. Dinner ll be ready in about a half hour.
Sure.
Are you hungry?
What?
How about Italy?
How about Bari?
Have you ever been to that station?
Why?
Nobody s asking you to.
I sat outside and had coffee.
Near the church.
He s a genius. They re not photographs they re stories, entire histories captured in moments.
No. I couldn t.
Trouble. Why?
I had a temper.
What?
Just that it s been a perfect day and that I d like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
Long day. Go to sleep.
Yes, thanks.
What?
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don t want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Well, what is this?
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
Gee, I don t know. I guess I m not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn t " need " meaning " Who goes with the Mystery " who pretends he isn t scared to death.
You have no idea what you ve done to me, do you? And after you leave, I m going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I ll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife s kitchen in Romania if you ll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
No one s asking you to!
You won t be made to feel! Period. You ve carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you ve touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn t human not to feel lonely it isn t human not to afraid! You re a hypocrite and you re a phony!
WHY?
For who?
Then he can move! People move!
The kids are grown! They don t need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
What about us? What about me?
Yeah. It could get better.
Francesca, listen to me. You think what s happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We re not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone most people don t even think it exists and you re going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don t feel apart of anymore you re telling me that s the right thing to do!?
But now that you have it
I m going to be here a few more days. I ll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let s not say any more now.
I CAN T SAY GOODBYE YET! We ll leave it for now. We re not saying goodbye. We re not making any decision. Maybe you ll change your mind. Maybe we ll accidentally run into each other and... and you ll change your mind.
Yes. And I ve accepted.
I said to him Cary you re being ridiculous. You re more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Later. Go back to sleep.
I m not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn s skirt.
I can t sleep.
I m going to miss you.
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
Hmm?
What s her name?
What s she like?
Well, what s nice about her? Tell us!
What happened?
They re not going to find her!
Apparently just before her death.
I don t care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn t know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
You people really don t like dogs.
Why don t you hang on and I ll see if she s here.
Well, close the fucking door by all means. But don t expect me to go down there and do it.
He yours, sir?
Then what do you care?
Yeah. He lived there. And died there, too.
Yeah?
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye d are king.
The man said just to use my imagination. Let s see... yeah, I get it. Potential. I can see it now. The first major urban theme park. Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials. Totally E ticket.
Just some flies.
What the hell you talking about?
I believe in you guys. You are the real shit. And you know it. Now I m putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too. Now all I " m asking is that everybody do their part. We ll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Climb out to where?
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years. I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
That s some terrible shit.
But that s your old hood, Pops.
Unh unh, little brother. I got a natural high. A supernatural high.
Wh wh whooo?
I do alright. Everybody s happy.
It ain t the money it s the high. The big fat floating what if? And it s way more profitable. Nobody ever wins. So you never have to pay out.
Yeah, but I ain t talking horse. I m talking about a five dollar kick in the head that s a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
Just try it.
Don t need luck tonight. I m just letting em have their say before I say no.
All that shinin and " reader and adviser " mess. That was your mama s bag. I don t know about the readin but you both can sure nuff advise.
Must be my clothes line. No? How bout my phone line?
Where we ll always be...
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Nothing but net? Could be a swish. Or a muthafucking air ball.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
How did you get in here?
I didn t want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
Aw that s easy. I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
I have to finish this for class.
I don t want you meeting around that house. You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
Nothing but a wide world o pain locked in there.
Maybe once upon a time. But that was long ago. Back before... before it became what it is.
You said the vision, the images. They re just that. Just pictures. They can t hurt you. That s what you always said.
All the more reason I should be here.
Who was he, Momma? He tried to kill us.
Who? Who is he? What is he?
But if it s him. If he s really come back, won t he know us? Love us?
Who?
Aren t you gonna do something about it?
I don t. Patrick doesn t. And his brother and sister don t. And they re in the house with him.
No we won t, Momma. I ll just have them call and tell Patrick it s us.
Naw. But they will be. They re the best.
That place is already bad luck.
No. It goes way back. Or so my Momma says.
Nothing. You d think she was crazy. And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma s not.
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets. There s a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one. The city of the dead.
Maybe. But there s an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Yeah. But when something bad happens, something really bad the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
Or the living fall in. Who knows.
Believe me, my old man d rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here. All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this hood as possible.
It s alright. If you want to go home...
Bill! Bill?!
I can t find you.
You got the shit?
Let me see it.
I thought you d be psyched. Just trying to do what you did. Take nothing and make something out of it.
You ll take care of it? Not this time. No way. I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
Sure, son. I went down there and torched the place myself.
I wouldn t have risked killing you to get you out. I was trying to protect you.
It s... it s a bad neighborhood. As you can see now.
You were just a kid.
That s the past. It s dead.
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay bird.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
And you? Still a pig. Just a much fatter one.
Or you didn t know what to do with it.
What building?
I didn t sell it.
That s a Bozo no no. Jay bird.
I ain t killed nobody. Shall I rack em? Play a game, Lupe?
You was just doing your job.
Shit, that was fast.
I m on my way home. Can you handle it yourself?
We got a gift for you, Eddie. Fresh new BMW.
But
You gon tell me you didn t ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
No, Eddie. It s just that, I dunno. He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur. All I remember is the voice. It was smooth and low and it didn t seem to be comin out of his mouth.
It was just like in my head.
Sqweeep. We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin " Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop... "
Yeah, you heard of him?
Not that I remember.
" This is Patrick... " "... And this is Patrick on crack. " Imagination, my butt. Even the space cowboy can t...
The Gangster of Love don t eat no fried chicken.
I am the future. I am all colors. All races. All creeds. I am the melting pot. I am the tossed salad. I am post racial.
That building?
I was born near here. But after my mother died, my dad moved. I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
But the place burned to the ground.
How could that be? The box was packed!
Evidence of what?
You hear that, bitch? Be quiet!
You want to get into this now?
What s that, Johnnie?
Just admit it, Caesar.
Know what?
All right! Where s the key?
The same way you did before.
I think you re fucking crazy!
Where s what?
You re a dead man! A fucking dead man!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
No!
I can t. I can t.
All part of the business.
Caesar, this is Corky. Corky, Caesar.
Jesus, Caesar!
That s none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
What are you going to do with it?
There s no time.
What are you talking about?
No! They re still on their way.
Why?
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
It was him. I m positive.
But you know he did it.
Caesar, maybe we should run
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let s just go now, before it s too late
The money? The money s gone.
But it could be anywhere.
No.
The hell I can t!
Bullshit! You don t need me! You ve never needed me! I can t help you! Understand?! I have to get out.
Caesar, this is crazy.
You don t, you can t believe that...
Caesar...
Caesar, what are you going to do?
What?
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
What happened to them?
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Where, then?
We re going to need some time.
Don t tell him
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think
You need the money just like we do.
You betrayed me!
I had to. You made me.
They were in a car accident.
They re all fine. Just bruises and shit.
Yes, I understand.
I should have let him kill you.
What are you going to do, V? Shoot me? Kill me in cold blood? I don t think so. I ll tell you why. If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago. If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home. But you didn t and I know why, because you don t want to kill me. Do you, V? Do you? No, I know you don t.
I should be going.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes. Thanks, though.
Lick me.
No.
Why?
Are you okay, Violet?
What? They ain t there?
Okay. Let me call around. I ll see what I can do. Don t go anywhere, okay?
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Yeah, it was Violet s idea. I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
Me? Why?
Oh Christ, the phone... That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn t it?
Yeah.
The key, yeah, the key s in my pants in the bathroom.
I m sorry, it s just you hear stories.
Yeah, sure. I m Corky.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
My pleasure... but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here. I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
Yeah, see, I m kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn t a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
No, it isn t your fault. The walls here are just so thin.
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it s like you re in the same room. But if it s too much trouble, I understand...
You re doing everything yourself?
Truck. Of course.
I knew it.
I don t, really. I was referred to him.
No, but Caesar does. He likes him. Says he s a good Italian.
Thanks.
Not exactly.
He said you lost something.
What do you want?
Maybe.
Why?
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
Look, I don t think this is a good idea.
You have to ask?
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it " The  Business. "
They took over a club I was working at. Caesar started managing it.
Basically.
Almost five years.
What?
The redistribution of wealth?
I m already in your bed.
I guess I wanted to.
Shit, here we go.
If there is one thing I can t stand about sleeping with women, it s all the fucking mind reading.
I m not afraid of anything.
I know! You can t understand, because we re different, Violet. We re different.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Let me guess. This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside. That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
Is that what her daddy tells her?
What are you saying? That you don t have sex with men?
For Christ s sake, Violet! I heard you! Thin walls, remember?
What the fuck was it?
What was it then?
What about that guy this morning?
Don t tell me, you re a workaholic.
Even though he knew about you?
He was in love with you, right?
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
Mickey?
For what?
What choice?
How much money?
That s why I need your help. You said you were good.
You think I m lying?
Is that what you think?
Do you think you know me like that?
Yeah.
He hung it up.
Johnnie?
Like each other? They hate each other.
It started way before I was around. I think basically it s because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Marzzone? As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, twice.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
He does it right in front of him.
Gino doesn t know English, or at least he pretends he doesn t, so he doesn t talk much. He gets right to the point. Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
The plane is in at seven, so I d say about eight.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy. Caesar calls him the driver.
An accident.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won t take off?
Not Caesar.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Thank you.
I won t.
That s okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
It s all right, Violet. It s working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Listen, if he doesn t run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can t do it. You re sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
I m still here.
Hey.
No.
Pop?
Caesar wants me to stay.
Violet, it s Gino and Johnnie. They were in a car accident.
I told you, the family doesn t want the police around. We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I ll find him. I swear I will.
Sure you re going to be okay? I mean, if you re having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
I don t know what we re talking about.
You re asking me a direct question?
You d want to make that go away. You d want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization. That it s all theoretical. You d want to sign off on that.
I m assuming we re exploring that possibility.
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
I want a second opinion.
What if he is working for someone else? What if he turned?
Our last sighting was forty eight hours ago. Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge. This is it. He s trained conditioned they re built to disappear. You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
If we can get a clean shot
That s what they re trained for just a surgical strike.
What do you want to do?
No you re not. You re not going anywhere. I m shutting this down.
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over. Call it off.
I work alone. Like you...... we always work alone.
Who are you? Rome? Paris? Treadstone... both of us... I was warned but...
... headaches... you have that... I get such bad headaches...
... or in a car... when it s dark... something with the headlights...... pills, right? Treadstone had those pills...
... what did you do?... you must ve really fucked up...
... someone said caffeine for a headache... doesn t seem...
... they won t let you go...
What did I do? I spent thirty million dollars on you. I spent three years finding you four years training you What did I do? What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
They re right about you, aren t they? You re fried. You really don t know what s going on, do you?
Of course. We had to try. We didn t know what was wrong. We didn t know you were in trouble.
So it s time to go home.
We ll make you better. We can put the pieces back. We can do that.
We have to go home, Jason.
There never was a Jason Bourne. You have to come with me. It s the only way. We can give it back to you...
Jason... They can t let you go...
MPG Capital.
I don t know.
Really.
Did you?
Yes.
Excuse me?

Oh, Jesus...
It s a little late for that.
Get the fuck away from my car.
Great. You know what? I ll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
I want to go home.
You have blood on your pants.
No. No, that was too easy
You swear? That s great. I feel so much better now.
I don t want to go alone. I want you to drive me to Paris. Like we re a couple. Like we re a couple and we re travelling together. That s all we re doing.
I won t hurt you.
I m sorry. Really. What do you want me to do?
I don t know.
Listen to what you want.
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
What? Like amnesia?
Amnesia? You re saying you don t remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
No.
Nothing. It s just not there.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could
Which was okay for a while, I was okay with it... But then there s all these other things all these other things I know how to do and this this stuff from the bank and... I think something bad happened.
I don t know.
I was shot twice in the back.
There was a gun. Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty foot wall I went out the window and I was doing it I just did it. I knew how to do it.
Why do I? I come in here instinctively first thing I do I m looking for the exit I m catching the sightlines I know I can t sit with my back to the door
Where are we?
I can t believe I slept.
Looks familiar?
I don t remember any of this.
Thanks for the ride.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
Nah... With you, I mean, you d probably just forget about me, right?
All this stuff it s all about boats. I think I m in the shipping business.
Please Jason omigod
... this is my picture... he s got my picture this is me this is Zurich this... this... this is yesterday
Where does this come from? How do you have my picture?
He s got my picture! this is yesterday! this is me! where did you get my picture?
Marie look at me there s no time for this
We can t stay here I can t stay here it s not safe here
We can go I can get us out of here but we have to go now
No.
You re wrong. I didn t know.
I didn t know this would happen.
And where is he now? You believe what you want, but I m telling you the truth I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
You stay if you want, you stay it s okay it s better maybe it s better I don t know But I can t stay here. I can t.
There s no time
How?
Forget it
Who paid the bill?
Nykwana Wombosi.
It s a name. Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht. He s the proud owner of an Alliance Security package. He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane.
I don t know.
You could do that?
Xxxxxx
Xxxxxx
I can t protect you anymore.
This your store?
Think I could rent a scooter?
My husband s out looking for him.
What?
You re in danger. All of you. I have no time to explain.
All the papers all the papers they asked for I brought all the papers
You only know that because I told you! Ask the case officer find his name it s on the papers I told him all this myself!
I paid this fucking guy I paid him four thousand dollars my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? I told this to the case officer last week...... here Mr. Thomas. I told Mr. Thomas I didn t know this guy was already married I admitted this!
I m the one that got ripped off! not you not the United States government me I m the one being ripped off!
Abbott wants to talk.
He accessed the account
Maybe it s a game. Maybe he s trying to send us a message.
Abbott. He knows about the embassy. He s coming down for a show and tell.
Where am I?
Where am I?
How did I get here?
... elephoned sir.
Machines don t fix themselves.
He s tampered with it, Dowser.
Mumble... Tuttle...
... Yer nostril?
You re putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry yes, odd use to pit wits against Central Services
... yer ducts.
... new washer.
What? How do you know my name?
Then perhaps you can help me. I ve lost someone who...
What? You mean you ve got...
What do I have to do.
It s reply paid.
You don t have to sing it.
Yes, I know. It s the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Mr Helpmann. I ve changed my mind. I d like to accept the transfer am I too late?
Where s Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Yes, you ve got to get me out of here. I ve got to find her.
I assure you, Sam, I m doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them even me.
Yes, well, from the Department s point of view you re certainly a bit of an own goal, but...
Sam, if you ve been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you ve got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Jack!
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval... I don t expect to see you slumming in Records what s the problem?
You sound worried.
Sorry. Nothing. See you I m going to be late.
Even later.
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful remember me to Alison and the er twins.
Er, I knew you looked different.
Quite, absolutely I always thought they were false.
SAM! What a surprise!
Thanks. Are you officer 412 / L?
Yes, thanks.
Ah...
I don t want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It s a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
I ve got numbers all over these I m not sure which is the one you want.
What is it?
Am I?
How do you mean?
Not much.
B58 / 732, that s A. Buttle isn t it?
No, no, I don t. I m just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
You got the wrong man.
You killed him?
I m sure you have
So how...?
What has Tuttle done?
He s a freelance subversive?
You didn t know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Very smart.
Yes. I m impressed.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest the Buttle arrest and since then she s been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation she s working for somebody, and she s not working for us.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Barbara s a perfectly good name, isn t it?
Why?
 baffled  I don t follow you.
Kindness? What s the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
Get her out of circulation I ve put her on the detention list.
Well, I... Good point. What do you suggest?
What does that mean? I don t want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Of course. We went to school together. You re my oldest friend.
You re the only person I can trust.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
But, I ve already put her on the search and detain list.
There s no procedure for that until she s been arrested.
We don t make mistakes.
Do you know what you re doing.
I m sorry, Sam, I m afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we ve also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems as a matter of fact, in your block. I d keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
Sam we ve always been close, haven t we?
Shut up!
Bastard!!!
What?
Help me, Jack! I m frightened!
Jack...
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
Is it stamped?
No, there s no stamp on it. You see! I can t give you the form until it s stamped.
If you say so.
Ah.
Oh.
It s you... it s you...
Don t look back! Act naturally!
No.
Them?
I don t want to hear about your fucking dreams!
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
It s my fucking life.
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn t I?
I didn t run away. I left the flat.
I didn t like it.
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
What?
Ah... Er... It looks as if you re taking me.
Looking for you.
Really.
Suit me?
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
Well, no system is.
Well, all wars do
Well, terrorists of course.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Every day?
What?
Who will?
You re joking.
I thought you arrested me.
Cut it out, Sam.
Get away!
Let go! We ve got to stop!
Oh God! What have we done?
It wasn t supposed to happen like this.
" And your children all gone. "
" Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone "... Do you think anyone s hurt?
Are you still following me?
Go away.
Leave me alone!
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
I saved you from the lorry and you re not very special.
Yes.
Your face... are you hurt?
Are you sure?
Where are you going?
Don t do anything silly.
It s not the machine. There s a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That s a B58 / 732 when it should be a T47 / 215... Tuttle... he should have  31. 06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
It s not our mistake!
Information Retrieval.
Don t worry.
I ve told you before. I d turn it down.
Really.
The refund for Tuttle!
I mean, Buttle! It s been confusion from the word go! He s been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
We ve got to get rid of it! There s been a balls up somewhere, and when the music stops they ll jump on whoever s holding the cheque!
I ve tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
Dead! Oh no! That s terrible! We ll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
What?
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
You are good to me Sam.
I delivered it.
What s the matter?
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
Yes. NO! You can t! You ve only just turned it down!
I did it for you.
It s what you wanted isn t it?
Sam Lowry.
Ah. Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
I ll bring it back in ten minutes.
Yes.
A woman eh? I see.
This is your dream girl, is it?
You haven t switched it on.
She didn t say anything about it to me.
I won t be held responsible.
I m sorry but...
 suddenly unctious  Oh, but of course...
What is it?
This isn t rare!
I m sorry. I don t want dessert. I don t want promotion. I don t want anything.
Of course. Isn t it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody s here.
Yes he is he wants to talk to you.
Mother?... What... what s... you ve got to help me...
Thirtieth floor, sir. You re expected.
No, sir.
No need, sir
I m afraid I can t, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
I m glad to see the Ministry s continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
Monsieur. Quel numero.
Have you got one or haven t you?
It s all right, Terry, it s all right, everything s all right.
What is it?
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
But... I called Central Services.
... but, with all the new rules and regulations... unncgh, c mon, c mon... they can t get decent staff any more... so... they tend to turn a blind eye... as long as I m careful.... Mind you, if ever they could prove I d been working on their equipment... well, that s a different matter... up a bit with the torch, sir.
Couldn t stand the pa ah we re getting warm
The paperwork, couldn t stand the paperwork. Over to the left please, if you don t mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there s more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe read this, fill in that, hand in the other listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn t even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B / 6.... Bloody paperwork.
Why? I came into this game for adventure go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there s trouble, a man alone. Now they ve got the whole country sectioned of and you can t move without a form. I m the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it! There s your problem.
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
Pregnant.
She say she in great pain.
She s having a baby. Twins.
You can trust me on this one.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
He looks like a cop.
Mary said you might be coming.
Sleeping in the back.
I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn t it?
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
I should be going. I just quit.
You re going to live.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
Dead.
No.
He s going to be all right, right?
No way, man.
What s his name?
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There s some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
Oh man, do you mean that? Thank you man, thank you. How?
What did you say?
No, I d better not.
Oh man, Bucky.
What?
I know him. That s Noel.
The first is always the best.
You never know.
At least he s got people around him.
Even when you say the things, there s always more things.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
It s okay. They re prescription. Works better with a little whiskey.
Yes.
Yes.
Our Lady of Misery.
No.
He s working a double shift.
She should go home.
Hello, I m Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
Well, the doctor says he s showing some movement. It s still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you d want to know.
You look so different.
I think it looks good.
How is she?
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
He s better, though, right?
It s best not to... It s good pizza, huh?
You remember that pizza place, Joe s on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago? When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
We moved out after that. Upstate.
They re fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse I was sort of born to it, I guess.
How long you been doing this?
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What s the worst thing you ever seen?
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we re done with all this.
I m all right. I just can t stand to see people tied up. I m in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he s screaming is cause he s tied up.
Don t say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he s better and I go in. It s killing me seeing him fighting like that. Look, since you re here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who s sick.
Maybe I should come up with you.
Nothing s going to happen. I ll come with you.
You asked me not to come.
Fifteen minutes.
We can still go back. I ll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
I need to sit down a minute.
He ll be all right.
It ll be a while before he s up and running again.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I ve had in months. I used some of your soap.
Can I bring you something back to eat a falafal, some pizza?
Frank.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I m on my way out. Anytime now.
The ghosts
I think the worst is over.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date? She hit you with a bottle?
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
She s the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we d give her a ride back to Misery. Her father s showing signs of improving.
I m hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
What about rule number three: Don t get involved with dispatchers named Love.
She s no whore, Marcus.
What s that, Frank?
That s too many.
What look?
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
Here s to the greatest job in the world.
I quit! I m through!
Burke. You won t believe it. He s showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he s fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He s in a CAT scan. I m giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
Who knows? It s all lower brain stem activity. The heart refuses to stabilize he s coded eleven times since he got here. This guy s a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp! Anybody else hurt?
How can that be? He was getting better.
He was tough. You did all you could.
Yeah. Great, isn t it?
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood s gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I m driving out of myself.
I ve taken that into consideration.
It s early for him.
Well, he s the steakhead of the night, then.
How s he doing?
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We ll wait for a real call.
Who with?
What do you want to break?
Why?
You need a reason, Frank. You don t just go around breaking people s windows. That s anarchy.
He s crazy. He can t help it.
Okay, whatta I do?
That s ridiculous.
Frank!
Frank!
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we ll get a job.
What?
I m not hungry.
I eat. I just haven t had coffee yet.
What?
That s what we re here for. Come on, Frank.
It s not our job to taxi drunks around.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we re cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We ve got a good job here.
Great. Network news, Washington... I love it. What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
I m not buying into any of that. I have a load to learn. I m not going to act as if...
Okay. Pretty petty party, isn t it, pal?
And the rule was...
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
Yes, Aaron. I know the names of the Cabinet.
I m starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
What s wrong with it?
We sure do. I don t mean it as a knock either. Go ahead. I ll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
What?
Sit on it! Now look.
It s not loaded.
No?
Oh, God, no!
Yeah well, I m sorry I m tying up Jane, I didn t realize you two would be going this late. Sorry.
They booted me out of Washington.
Yes. And I m sorry that they re sending you down for a while, but you ll make it back... Where they sending you?
London. That s a promotion!
It is. Yes that s where they had Rorish, for God s sake, before they made him anchor. I can t stand it they re grooming you for it all and you don t even know it.
I thought she d be here. I ll go with you.
Congratulations on history s longest winning streak.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
I don t like the word gay.
Ravenous homosexual.
At six o clock on the wake up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
A half hour in the lobby.
Why do you say that?
Sure.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Good night.
Eleven and a half.
If we don t get to their camp soon, we won t be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Did you shoot their boots?
We can cut back at the end.
I ll tell you later where you going to watch from?
Right and we have the 81 pilot on the way in Nobody else will have him.
I figured out exactly why it is I m so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor... It s because if I do that well, they ll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better. That s why.
Absolutely... You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
I didn t know you were going with him.
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you me showing up while you re getting ready for a date.
As good as humanly possible.
Well, the line of the jacket No really.... just very nice... just right. I wish I could be there.
I m not sure I ll be able to... I...
You didn t see it or speak to anybody?
Then it went well.
Define your terms.
No.
No.
I lost six pounds...
It was great... writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they ll never let me another again. Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads how was your evening anyway?
People phoned in.
I m not kidding.
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
I don t know. At a certain point it was so off the chart bad it got funny. My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane sweat running down my face makeup falling into my eyes people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway. And I m chipper because you finally showed up. I thought I d cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
Call him I mean it can wait, right?
This is important to me.
Yes, I guess. Yes.
Yeah being a basket case.
This isn t friendship.
No. You know that I m not.
Speaking.
Stop. Ernie thought I was good too he couldn t help. My agent has a hot prospect the number two station in Portland. The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks. Personally, I think he should aim higher.
Ernie told this story. How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried. He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits. He says you re lucky if you can get out while you could still cry. I should have quit this place three years ago.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful why s that?
Okay, that s very easy. Five, six years from now I ll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
I ll be walking with my wife and two children we ll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I ll tell him...... it s not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
Really?
Your hair s a little funny.
In front of a little it s a bit... You want a mirror?
I ll put him in the low corner of the frame good.
Stop it.
Outside?
Just tell me what s really going on. I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
Just blunt talk, okay? I d really appreciate bluntness.
Wait. Bullshit me a little... I m beginning to appreciate it.
Ah, damn the fucking jerks My, God. They want to fire me.
Do one thing to me? Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News they ve never seen me do it. I think it could turn them around.
Please prepare carefully. This couldn t come at a better time.
I understand. I ll go with you.
They told me they d keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
Move away from me.
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuckes. Snot... Fuckee. You want to use that?
What is she shooting?
Take care, Paul. It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
No. I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Almost immediately.
Bill... This is hard on all of us and it s no time for compliments. But I think it s extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
Yes.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
And Bobbie says...
We could...
He said something about...
Should I...
No stop where he s all besieged.
No, I don t think so.
Follow me.
Bad manners.
I know... I mean you didn t do anything special for me tonight. You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing. Honestly. Because I don t know if you ve homosexual or not and you re not, are you?
Okay. At least let me show my appreciation. The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
Yes, it s true. They re going to make it public Wednesday but isn t it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
Not impressed exactly but a break in the clouds.
Nobody else had it.
That s okay.
No. Really... don t worry about it.
Yes. You didn t have to come here. It s just that I m going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Yes, stop! I wondered if you could find out anything about what s happening. What s wrong?
Oh.
Hey, okay. Look Buddy I ve got to go to work.
I ll speak to you.
Tell me I m on the way in.
No. They re firing even more people than they said. Some will want to talk. It could help.
I just have two more pen pals and then I m done.
Nooo. This way the rotation stays the same.
No. Not even you.
I don t know.
No, nothing. I ve got a problem, I guess.
Proud? I m just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
Oh my. I see you studying so hard, Tom. What do you think the problem is?
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
Okay, that s your opinion. I don t agree.
I just wanted to tell you how great you were. My name s Tom Grunick.
I like " godsend. "
Totally understood. Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you ve had. Totally sorry.
That actually goes on...
So great right?
I trust you.
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things. Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
Well, come on it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track. Did you go to college?
Uh huh.
Hey?
You weren t. Thanks. How does it feel being here?
No. Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday so I m cramming.
' Really a lot appreciate it... '
How s it going?
I just got back I don t know which end is up.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
Billion.
What do you mean clean?
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
Yeah. It was an unusual place to be.
Yeah?
Well, I thought I d check if all of you were still here. I ll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Well, I ll go in and have a bite.
I m not sure I d be good company tonight.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Okay. You didn t like the party, huh?
Eventually. Does it have to be right now?
What?
Well, what is it?
Jane, yes. Tom? Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me... I m sorry... Hey, you called me.
Says who? Not important ha ha ha. I was dreaming Oh, no can t tell how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Nooo. Is it your story?
Why, you need me for the story?
Uh huh.
Oh, good.
It moved me. I did relate to it I really did. It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up and that might not have been my choice... but it s real and it got me... and I think a lot of the time I m too conservative about that kind of stuff. Okay?
Who?
You just can t stop editing me. Huh?
Because you re nuts.
Oh let s see wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
Three... I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don t have to do it.
I d like to know. I ll go along.
Don t run off like everything s settled the minute you make up your mind.
It s not that it s hard. I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
Where are you?
Well, when?
I know. I taped it.
No. That sounds more important. Let s forget about tonight.
I ve got my father coming through tomorrow anyway. I should get some sleep.
Yes.
Good night??!
He uh said he liked you because you looked like you had fire and honesty.
Yes. Then he said a really weird thing...
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
How can you say that to me?
That s yes?
Of course it s the reason. It s terrible what you did.
Jesus, if you re glib about this I m going to lose it. I was up all night and...
It made me ill. You could get fired for things like that.
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway... You totally crossed the line between...
It just proves that the difference we have are...
It s amazing. You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I m nitpicking. Try and get this. When you edited that...
Well, let s do a special report on that... I mean that s news.
Yes, I am. Thanks. I mean it.
You want to come?
Then you should stay here.
A picnic?
Well, there s a guy, but he says he ll fly up a lot.
I m sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I m going back in a few hours.
Go ahead what?
God Almighty Whew. Do I mind? Why do I mind? I do mind. What a shock I don t have a right to... I don t think I like him. I know I don t respect him... So what am I talking about what am I saying to you?
How come you re not chasing it down yourself?
Boy, that s nice... I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I ll check it. Anything I can do for you?
I just might.
I didn t finish talking to you!
Yes. Fifty dollars an hour, right?
What, right now?
Oh it s enough...
I already told you I m not.
Um...
What!
Whaddya mean?
Anything new?
Is the manager cooperating?
Alright I got you, man. It s my turn for freak patrol.
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
It s a... full length life size figure!
It s not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Uh, well, I m a little nervous, I never did a person before.
I came over to see you. I brought something... I wanted to show you.
Walter! Jeez!
Yes Walter.
Tell us what you re going to make next, Walter.
Thank you.
Ready? We ve got plenty of time.
Well... w what kind of people do you like, Carla?
You think I m creative?
Walter, I m sorry...
No! I want to talk about it now!
Why not?!
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Forget it.
Just about anything, Walter.
What?
I hope this was made with egg whites!
What s this sauce! I m lactose intolerant.
Nothing... nothing at all.
Don t ask.
Why not?
Well, I ve been thinking... I didn t realize how much... talent Walter actually had. It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time. Dead wrong.
That s the idea, Walter. It s the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
Abstract? With his talent for realism?
I know.
I know, man.
I know, man.
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Didn t you hear him?
No man, he ain t the type. He don t get enough vitamin E.
I was just looking at Carla s picture.
Well I was uh, just looking...
What is it, your laundry?
Dead Cat?
I didn t mean to.
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you re here why don t you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Yes they are, aren t they? Look, why don t you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
Well...
I don t have another cat!
OK... good night Mr. De Santis!
Now why shouldn t you, Walter? Things are different now...
I don t know, it just happened, I guess. I didn t mean to.
Yeah, why?
Well Why not? I gotta make statues Leonard. You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them. I can t go back to being a busboy!
Well, w what did you do?
Yeah?
I m trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
I can t talk right now.
No... look I m busy...
I m holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Hi. I know you! I ve seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
Hm.
Chasing the dragon? Whaddya mean? You sure you don t want a pancake?
You re like an undercover guy!
Huh?!!!
C connection?
Telling you what?
Smack?
Alaska! What the heck s wrong with it!
Is that what that is? I never seen any before. I always thought that stuff was expensive!
You are?
You re coming downtown with me, Walter. You re gonna come clean with me, you re gonna name names or I swear to God I ll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
I got you cold, pal. Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
Yeah yeah yeah look! I ve heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you re coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back
Don t give me a hard time Walter! You don t want to get me mad! You re coming with me!
NO! NO DON T SHOOT ME I DON T WANT TO GET SHOT!
Walter shut up and relax!
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
I know that I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end to be uncreative you might as well be dead... a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Did you like it Mister Brock?
No thanks. Sounds good though.
Why not?
I thought you didn t respect money!
What do you get?
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
T turned on?
That s really nice of you Mayolia.
I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do something!
Gee. Thanks.
My arm! He took my fucking arm!
I had him in my grasp.
The other two the new ones. Where are they?
I don t know. Coach said I had to work on my ab s. '
Let s move out!
Jeffrey, I don t mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
Suck!
That s it, man. That s the whole story.
You didn t like them.
Would you sleep with them?
Well, there it is, isn t it? You don t even like them, and you d sleep with them. What s that all about?
You think? Split?
Let me in.
Wait a minute. What s wrong with you, man?
No offense, man, but I think you re on something nasty. Why don t you just go and cool out and I ll see you in the morning or something.
Get away from here.
You don t mean, like, a cheerleader?
Yeah, I saw her. Bitch took my wheels.
My bike! She s a lesbian, too. She told me.
Yeah, I guess.
Real quality timers, Hugh.
It s the news, Buffy.
I just want to see the basketball scores. It s important.
Nothing.
I do? I guess I do.
I thought we were meeting here.
Oh, come on, Buffy. You know what s going on. It s not working out at all. I ve got to move on. I mean, I ve got needs, too. I told you about all this.
Didn t you get my message?
You weren t home. Like always.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
Hi there.
Oh, I m good. I m good. Kind of miss my knees, though.
Not exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah, I was bailing. I have a friend, and he s really... well, he s really vampire, I guess. Bad scene.
Thanks. Tomorrow morning, I m on a bus. I m gone.
I ll back that up.
I know. My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. Prison came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
I think I ll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Oh, I ll be fine. Got my chair, got my window, I m great.
Yeah?
I know.
I don t know. I kind of thought I ought to be here. You know, this isn t exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
Oh, God. It s him. I think it s him.
I m going shopping. Don t try to stop me.
A dress.
For the dance.
I m going to the senior dance.
What for?
I don t believe this. The world s under attack by the legions of the undead and you re going to a mixer?
You got that right. I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
Listen, I know you re bummed about your friend, and I m really sorry...
But, Buffy, you re the guy, the chosen guy.
Pretty shallow of you.
I m glad you came.
Are you nuts, Buffy? There s a hundred of them out there. They ll rip us apart.
Don t be such a fraidy cat.
We ve come all this way. We just have to check it out. I got a hunch.
Bogutude. Blow it off.
You re weird and I m afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there s a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
 What do you think?
Why don t we see a movie?
Where?
Buffy, I m gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man s Hebrew National.
I forgot.
Look, a lot s been going on. That s what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you. You see... a while ago, I met this guy
This isn t important? The earth is our home.
Yeah, whoops I came.
I m looking for you, actually.
Not at all. My name is Merrick. I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were... complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
I ve searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
To bring you... your birthright.
You must come with me. It s much too late already. You must come with me to the graveyard.
Wait!
You don t understand. You have been chosen.
You must believe me. You must come with me while there s still time.
To stop the killing. To stop the vampires.
Yes.
In Virginia.
China.
Why didn t you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
Cramps?
Just for protection. You won t have to do anything. I just need you to watch.
I have cheerleading squad.
There s a great deal I have to show you, I m not even sure where to start There s so little time.
Do you know what a Vampire King is?
Oh, yes. And the man from your dreams. Lothos.
Yes. They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork. The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own. You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I d anticipated. Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy. But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
We ll cover it later.
In a way, yes. Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you. What your strengths are, your likes... Everything. What s your best subject?
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped. Why?
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Cheerleading. For... sporting events, yes?
All right. Why don t you show me a cheer?
Yes, yes. It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Who we gonna beat?
Oh. I thought... you lead me
I had to test you.
And you caught it! Only the chosen one could have done that.
Last night. You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn t you?
Don t you see what s happening? You re changing. You ve got powers you ve only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you ve never dreamed of. God, this hurts. I ve administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working. I m sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me? Let alone so powerfully?
No. No bats, no flying. They... float, occasionally. Not really flying.
Oh, several. Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
Good Lord. What do you study in history?
They were vampires?
Fine.
Does the world Duhh mean anything to you?
It s natural. A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it. It s part of how you are able to track them.
You ll get used to it. I m more worried about your tactical mistakes.
A what?
Don t start with me again.
Buffy...
What do you want? Encouragement? Gosh, Buffy, you re so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I m just having a warm fuzzy. '
I...
Five.
Not if you re careful.
It s what I was raised to do. There aren t many of us left, the Watchers.
There s a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...... near a bunch of big rocks. That s where I was born. My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs. There s a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we re just a bunch of harmless old loonies. I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger... I m sorry. I m not supposed to... I shouldn t go on like this.
It isn t important.
Buffy, don t... don t start thinking of me as your friend. It interferes with the work, and it...
As for example, what?
Vampires of the world, beware.
I can t work this.
But it s in the back. Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
Make time, okay? You re the one who told me to act normal. I ve missed three practices already. If I m not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone s gonna talk.
Why because it s not my fate? It s not in the Book of All Knowledgefullness that I m gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
I m pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore. Come on, Merrick. Football. Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
Toasty. You should come; it s gonna be a great game.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
You got a C plus? I can t believe I cheated off you.
That s the plan.
I was just scared is all.
Thank you very much.
Cassandra s really smart.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let s go, guys.
Thanks.
Nicole...
Hi.
What s happening? What do you want?
My parents have money...
Really?
You know you must. There is only one. Now you are that one. It is time.
I don t understand.
I m just a girl.
Hi, Grueller.
Could be.
Got that.
Oh, baby!
No
Well, I hope so.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
Snapped. Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room. Perm over heels.
Wit tay.
Pike isn t a name. It s a fish.
Can t they make exceptions? Maryanne Heinel? She s such a scud. Can t we have a Maryanne clause?
Oh, please! When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out of it thing ever, or did I blink?
Like you ve got a grip.
You know, just because you re having full on wiggans doesn t mean you have to drag us into it. This isn t just any dance. It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
I m leaving, man. I m bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
I don t think so.
I am.
I didn t say " Crash ". I said Nuke.
Honey, don t ever listen to a woman when she s making love. They ll say the strangest things.
You can learn to like it.
Y know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever. Baseball s a good stepping stone for things like that.
What?
Jesus, Annie, I don t know
Big League pitchers don t use these.
What is this " I, I, I " stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren t you glad to see me? Don t I look nice?
Good. Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous. Let s play catch.
Just do what I say. Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
My right nostril?
I m really beat. I need some serious " z s "
Switch nostrils?
If I throw too hard I ll hurt the kid.
A little better.
Y know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it ll work for a whole buncha games.
Not that. I mean the re channeling of my sexual energy. Maybe we shouldn t make love for awhile.
Nuke?!
Get over here.
No, no, it was great.
No, that s okay. All I need s a little nap.
You can t seduce me.
I know what it is.
Yes I do...
What a nasty thing to say.
I m trying to play with your body!
Of course I m seducing you for Godsakes, and I m doing a damn poor job of it Aren t I pretty?
Cute?! I hate cute! Baby ducks are cute! I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
I did.
He said if I gave in to you I d start losing again.
You don t have to...
But you re father s in there!
That s great!
I think I m ready for the Show.
I got lured.
" I didn t get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions ".
Annie Savoy. Wanta dance?
Crash, I didn t think you
Why do you get to choose? Why don t I get to choose?
Oh my... Don t leave...
I m not interested in a woman who s interested in that boy.
Yep.
When you re hitting you shouldn t think about anything but hitting. But you shouldn t think about it too much. The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
What you see in that guy he s dim, pretty boy. a young, wild,
You re pulling your hips out.
Why not? If you hit twenty homers this year you ll be the all time minor league champ! The record s
Oh no, I think it d be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
You got me all confused.
Nuke won t go to bed with you, eh?
Aren t we all?
I want to be had.
He won t make love to me anymore.
I teach part time at the Junior College. What if I told you I was through with Nuke? He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
I don t imagine there s much I could teach you.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I m ready for a complicated man.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
Who?
What s so great about baseball?
It s true, It s true! Least it used to be true. It ain t possible that baseball s not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
No.
Well... I used to think that wasn t the worst thing in the world to look forward to. Lately I m not so sure.
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous? How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
There might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
Yeah... you a witch?
You d be great, just great... Cause you understand non linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game cause of the lines and the box scores an all but the fact is that there s a spacious " non time kind of time " to it...
What?
Jose Galindo. He hit. 314 at Lynchburg last year.
What s it say?
You need a nickname.
Which one of us?
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
The socks? It s cold in here.
Who s he play for?
We gonna fuck or what?
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
Yes. A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
If you believe in Voodoo.
You missed him!
It was a cocksucking call!
No! I said It was a cock sucking call and you can t run me for that!
You spit on me!
You re in the wrong business, Jack you re Sears Roebuck material!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
Beg me!
Beg me again!
You re a cocksucker!
I thought I was
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
But he ain t seen my heat
Well, I held it like an egg.
I m having a blast. God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
How?
' Cause you don t respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don t respect the game and that s my problem. You got a gift.
I ain t pissing nothing away I got a Porsche already. A 944 with A. C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
You been in the Majors?
Naw...
By the dozen. Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies I m through with one night stands.
Go for it.
What?
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging in the Show they woulda ripped you.
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
It ll keep the fear of God in the hitters. Trust me.
It s time you started working on your interviews.
Boring.
Jesus.
C mon!
You fuck!
Why are you a fuck? Cause you got talent. I got brains. But you got talent! You re God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year. All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound and that s for science and dog meat.
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
What?
Forget it.
No.
Fear and ignorance.
I don t need a crazy woman in my life.
And where can I go?
Pussy.
I ain t hitting a man first.
From what I hear you couldn t hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
Throw it. C mon, right in the chest.
Shut up I like this song... April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you help you get comfortable.
We ll be praying for you.
We ll pray anyway.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
Can I give you my testimony?
Ain t he warning up?
It s a league record.
We had the gun on him tonight the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97. He s got the best young arm I ve seen in 30 years.
We re eight and sixteen.
Eight and twenty four! How d we ever win 8 games?
I heard he s wearing women s underwear and he s breathing through his pingala nostril.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
It s a damn convention.
Some kid hittin. 300 in Lynchburg... probably a bust.
Jim looking for somebody.
Looking for Crash Davis.
I m Nuke LaLoosh. With the Bulls.
Where does he go?
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
But you can t just fire him. Webb s his brother in law. He s County Commissioner.
This is his state. His uncle s Chief Judge. His brother in law runs the County Commission. I don t know how many other relatives he s got in town. There s gotta be a way to work him back in.
What?
What are you talking about?
You were never my guest?!
I never comped you?! I don t comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
Liar.
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me
Was I at that dinner?
Was I at that dinner?
Was I at that dinner?
This is a very auspicious occasion.
On behalf of the Teamsters Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you...
But what happens when they do find out?
It s a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I d have to run it my way.
I m serious. No interference.
These guys back home don t give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from
The old man said, Maybe your friend should give in. And when the old man says maybe, that s like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
What do you propose?
They ain t sendin Nicky nowhere.
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Excuse me.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
No, it s it ll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He ll hurry her up. How s everything else besides this?
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife s pregnant again.
Yeah.
Wait, hold on a second.
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
You fuckin piece of shit.
Hello.
... Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
Lester...
I know she s there. Don t fuck around with me.
Sam, I I don t know where she is, okay?
702 472 1862.
Right away.
Right back.
So, once she signs those papers, she ll be the only person to have total access to the box? No one else, including myself?
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
I can t! I m tied!
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
I m gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I ll
I don t know.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal?
They payin?
Eight.
You find any cash in there, we ll whack it up with you.
Somethin, huh?
What do you think about me movin out here? What s the matter? You got a problem with that?
You mean, I have your permission?
I don t care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I m tired of that shit back there. Look at this place. It s made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody s gonna know what we re doin! There s nobody here to see us! Everybody s back home.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
... and he tells me to go fuck myself.
Then he called me a faggot.
I m sorry about this. Really.
Okay.
Why, somebody s complaining?
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
What am I doin out here? I m tryin to make a livin, that s all.
Nope, there s no way.
Forget it. You can t even set foot in the parking lot. That s how serious it is.
In so many words, yes.
It s impossible. It s booked up, and you gotta make a reservation. It s...
What re you doin? He s a square guy, for chrissakes. You can t treat him like that. He s gonna run to the FBI.
I m not tryin to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What re you doin? Where s your head?
Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I m responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin through the place. It s all over, I m gonna tell you, it s all over, if I don t get that license. And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it s gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
No, I don t wanna come
I don t wanna come along with you.
I ll be honest with you.
I don t wanna be involved in anything you re talkin about...
You mean, quiet like this: I m the boss. That s quiet?
Yeah, that s out of context. Okay.
Well, back home they don t know about fuckin control. That looks bad.
Yeah?
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
Yeah.
I lost control?
Look at you. You re fuckin walkin around like John Barrymore.
A fuckin pink robe and a fuckin...
... uh, uh, cigarette holder. I m I lost control?!
You know, I didn t want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
Yeah.
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin Diamond that Lester Diamond incident.
No, I didn t. What good would that do? That s not the fuckin point.
The point is that she s upset. She s and you got a fuckin problem.
Hey, she came to talk...
... to me.
She came to talk to me...
And I what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
It s none of my business?
A week ago it was my business, now it s none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin for you, then you need me.
Your fuckin head is getting bigger than your casino. That s your problem, pal.
Fuckin walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
I see you, you motherfuckers.
Practice enough this week, you prick?
Meet me at three.
No, a...
Why?
What people?
I don t even know what you re talkin about, Nick.
I didn t do anything. I mean, I didn t order you or anybody... I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
Yeah, I said I let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it s my ass. It s not yours, it s my ass.
I
What are you
I m only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I m known. People see me. They know they can t fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That s right.
Me?! I wouldn t even be in this situation if it wasn t for you. You brought down so much fuckin heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
No, it it Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
... you? Do you remember what I told you?
You never?
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
Just give me the money. Fuckin give me the fuckin money, Sammy.
Yeah.
And what d she want?
I don t know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don t know... She s drivin me fuckin crazy.
She s driving me fuckin crazy.
Sammy.
It s me.
No, I m not okay.
Well...
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger s over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
Yeah, she s here.
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin bitch.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
I m sorry, but he knew about our gettin hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin here.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
I think you re way out of line talkin to me like that. What you re sayin is libelous, and you re in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He s weak, he s incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There s not much more I can do for him.
I can t do that. And I appreciate the fact that he s your brother in law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You re all just our guests. But you act like you re at home. Let me tell you somethin, partner... you ain t home. But that s where we re gonna send you if it harelips the Governor. Thank you for your time.
Well, that s why they paid so well.
Well, it s a little too early. I d say Thursday would be good. I ll know by then. Is that all right?
I ll come by.
... as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
... And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
We can t get rid of him?
Nice to see you, Senator.
Certainly. Senator.
L chaim.  Yiddish for to life 
What is it?
No, just just give him, give him ten. That s it. Ten. I ll be right down.
Who s this?
Right away. Okay?
Ginger s mission in life was money.
She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
Hey, Mitch.
Thank you.
We re not getting any younger. Don t you think it s time? Aren t you gettin tired of all this shit? Bangin around, hustlin around?
I m gonna do you one better. I m trying to marry you. You want to marry me? I m serious. I mean, I I want to settle down. I want a family.
I know I d be a good father. I know you d be a good mother.
I m forty three years old. I don t want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much. And I can t think of anybody better to be with. And I don t feel like waiting anymore.
Yeah, I know all that.
I I I...
No, I I... mean... that can grow as I as long as there s a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I m realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway? It s a... it s a mutual respect. It s it s a devotion. It s a... it s a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation... based on that mutual respect... I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
You know I m doin well now. And I m gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn t work out between us, I m gonna make sure you re okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I ll take care of you better than you d ever imagine.
Yeah.
I m okay. I just You just have to understand. I ve been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I I just... I don t... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh huh.
It s chinchilla.
It s nice isn t it?
The only thing is... you shouldn t keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
Now look, pay attention to me. What I m gonna tell you is very important.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
But as much as they loved her...
What do you need?
Well, why don t you take it out of your account? There s a lot there.
Yeah.
Well, what s the difference? I just need it.
I m aware of that. We don t have to turn this into a big deal. Okay? We don t have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
No.
Look Sam, I ve been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you re making me beg you for this.
Okay? And you re embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
You can trust me.
No, he didn t.
Isn t it bad enough you re drinkin too much, you re takin all my pills too?
Look for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that s when I have extreme pain. I had a three month supply. What d you do with em?
Yeah, how do I know?
What? What?!
Okay.
Okay, okay.
I don t need one.
That s all you care about. You don t care about me at all.
No, you don t.
... on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
We had a deal. Remember that? He said if it didn t work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
Hi, it s me. Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
... please. That s all I m askin you.
What do you mean?
Uh, I don t know. I gotta tell you, I don t know.
I under understand that. I I know I fucked up.
I gotta tell ya...
What s it...
Pretty serious.
It s, uh, it s under twenty five.
... twenty five thousand?
And...
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
Okay?
With what?
He needed some clothes.
He wanted a watch, too.
Mm hm.
First of all, he s not gonna wear f thousand dollar suits. But let s say he did, which he won t. How you gonna get fitted for twenty five suits in three days? I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can t get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
Yeah.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice and he doesn t know what the fuck a good watch is so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
Would you knock it off, Sam?
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
You ll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
You re not takin Amy.
I threw it away.
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it s just You know, I m driving down the freeway and the fuckin thing s beep beep beep beep. You know, I m in a restaurant and it s it s embarrassing. I don t want to do it anymore. Where s Amy?
So, who d you go to lunch with?
And where d you go?
What d you have?
What did Jennifer have?
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I m gonna listen in on the other line.
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Who were you with?
What if he won t stop?
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin door? Are...
... you out of your mind? That s our child. Are you out of your fuckin mind?
I ought to fuckin have you committed. You fuckin do that again, I ll f, I ll f
I should have
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me. Listen, you fuckin cunt.
Listen to me.
Let me tell you something. Listen to me.
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I ll fuckin kill you. Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin simple, I ll fuckin kill you, you bitch.
You fuckin whore!
You understand? What? Let you go?
You want your jewelry?
I wou I wouldn t do that if I were you.
I wouldn t do that...
So what? So who fuckin blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
You get down here!
Will you stop it? You re drunk, you re on drugs. You re gonna
You re gonna be sorry if you don t stop that.
You ll wake the whole neighborhood!
Not gonna let me in?
Oh, you are...
I am calm!
But it was just mine.
What are they doin way back there? Bring em up here where they belong. You can t even see em over there.
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring em up front.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
Don t thank me, just do it. You re the Slots Manager. I shouldn t have to tell you this.
Shoot, it s gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn t have a chance to call you.
Well, there s no way to determine that, Sam.
Well, it s a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
I really think you re
I really think you re overreacting in this whole
You re firin me?
I ll regret it even more if I keep you on.
A record of the arrests...
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
You ve been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that that s gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
I m just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
Can t do it with both hands?
Can you do it with your left hand?
So, you re a righty?
What?
Yeah, that s my pen. Why?
And don t forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
You re fuckin right, you made a bad mistake. Cause if you come back here we catch either one of you we re gonna break your fuckin heads and you won t walk out of here. You see that fuckin saw? We re gonna use it. You don t fuck around in this place. You got it?
Get out of here.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah?
I didn t give em the m
Thanks, Nick.
I don t want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
You shut up.
Your cumma? What are you doin with your cumma?
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
Well, I m goin all over, layin money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell s goin on?
Well, then, from now on, I m gonna start keepin records.
Well, I keep layin out my own fuckin dough for these trips and nothin ever comes back. I mean, what hell s goin on? What are we doin over here?
Oh, listen, I understand that there s always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
Hey.
Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I m sorry. We ve got some complaints about about the noise.
I understand.
That s not a problem, that s not a p
Go get a bag, man.
Pitch black?! It
You You fuckin moron, I ll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
Nicky, I did
I did I didn t
We re waiting on Carmine.
He s gone?
Carmine left?
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh?
How are you?
I ll take care of it, Remo.
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
I know.
What re you gonna do?
I know.
It s private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn t be fuckin the Jew s wife, would he? Because if he is... it s a problem.
Because there s one thing about these old timers: They don t like any fuckin around with the other guy s wives. It s bad for business.
No. I ain t see anything like that.
I m positive. Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
Hm.
He s good. He s fine.
No problem.
I understand.
I ll be right out.
Mm.
Mm.
All right.
Yeah.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
Pleasure. Very nice to meet you.
I know it wasn t a nice thing to do but
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin surprise.
Yeah. He s just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I m a working girl, right? You don t think I m gonna go into a situation like this if I don t think I m gonna get covered on the back end.
Am I right?
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
Mm, you want to steal it?
I m told it s worth about a million dollars, maybe more.
I should have never married him. He s a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality. Gemini s the snake. You know you can t trust the snake. I mean it.
I do.
Well, I guess it s cause he loves you so much. He s jealous and worried.
Look, I ll try to find out what the hell s goin on. When I see him I ll talk to him.
All right?
Oh, come on.
You re so nice.
No, I really do. I think he s gonna kill me.
I ll be there.
Oh, you re right, I know. It s... well, I was just
Nothin.
I don t
Yeah?
Well, I was thinkin, maybe... you know somebody at the bank... could help me get my jewelry out? There s a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I d be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Okay.
Mm hm.
Yeah. Cause, you know, He s never gonna give me my jewelry.
He holds that key so tight, he s probably got it stuck up his ass.
No, he wouldn t. I would have. And he d ve been right, too. I mean, seriously. Well, there s one thing you don t do. You don t take a guy s kid and then take off.
You did. You re right.
I did what you told me to.
' Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Sure did.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I ll tell you that.
Come on, come on, you re a toughie. You can take this. Don t cry.
Yes, you are.
Come on. Don t be scared.
Is that what you want?
A sponsor.
Mm... okay. Don t worry about it. Nobody ll fuck with ya anymore. I ll take care of ya.
Yes, I will. It s what you want, isn t it? Huh?
It s what you want?
Me? I said... nothin. I said, I said, No, no, no. Everything he said, I just kept sayin no.
If it s so fuckin dangerous, then why don t you kill him?
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
What about my money?
I don t need you! I have my own fuckin money!
All right. Be careful.
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
You know, I ve got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
Okay?
Where are you goin? Where are you? You re in that place. Where are you?
No, you re not. Where are you? Where are you?
You are.
No, Lester.
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
Promise?
You do?
Okay, then.
It means I got the money.
Lester he called you here.
Here.
He called you right here.
So, he knows where you are. That means he s sending some guys over here probably right now.
That s Yeah, he s sitting by the phone like a dumb bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That s what he s
What do you think we re gonna do? He s probably got guys outside the fuckin house!
It s this bullshit. It s just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin problem, you know.
You re done yakkin, okay? You re done yakkin now?
No, I m gonna drive.
I think that s it.
God, I m telling you, they re out!
Boy, look at this place, huh?
You call this guy and tell him I m comin?
Get up.
Get up.
What s takin so long over there?
She asleep?
I took care of everybody.
Hey. This is Shelly.
Stacy.
But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin money back.
It s up to you.
Fuckin Jews stick together, don t they?
Let s get out of here.
Walk, walk, walk. What d you say?
Yeah, what d you tell him?
You think he s goin home, makin a beef behind my back?
Yeah, what s to stop him?
I don t trust him anymore. But they d never okay anything, you know?
Well, now, sure they re askin. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin he s gonna start a fuckin war or somethin. I m not sure yet, you know. But I w You know, but you know what I want you to do?
Oh, he ain t nobody.
Angelo and Buster.
They ll do it.
Yeah.
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I m talkin about?
Dominick said they re in the motel?
Get out. Get out! Get out!
Why d I get involved with this fuckin nut in the first place? Get out!
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
No, no, no, no!
Fuck you!
Ch Charlie M!
Charlie M.
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
Hey.
How you doin?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin.
You sure?
Well, I m a little confused here.
Yeah.
No, I want to have this marked, Mr.
Denying?
Yeah.
You ll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don t need...
In women?
I ll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don t think dogs are supposed to like me.
Guilty. I am.
Nothing, just a jolt of deja vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler can t remember how it turned out..
You re probably right.
Kincaid got a little frisky last night... So, meet here at eight and go from there? By the way, I m Brock Leviathan.
There s a nice cafe down the street... unless you re afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
What did you think?
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank s Fun Palace?
Stop. We are not having a " duality " conversation. " Ooh, he has a secret side. Ooh, she has a dark side. " Please. Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me? You get one life. One shot. I m so tired of women saying " I have an inner strength " or " Deep down, I m really ambitious. " " One day I ll design my own line of clothing and write children s stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night. " If you are something, then you better be out there doing something. You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right the reality... and the lie. We are not having a " duality " conversation.
What little boy doesn t... My God... it s, it s... Catwoman.
What s the matter? What are you saying?
Your warehouse? Go on ahead to your " warehouse. " I ll be okay...
I got home fine. How s the " warehouse. "
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
It would be honor, Brock. Now let s go get this guy...
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
They do take their time. So.. Selina Kyle...
She has a real spirit.
She has reason to be suspicious.. Doesn t she?
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I m not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is The Man will pay. My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I ve tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
I ve been looking for you. Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time. Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Boss, we better roll if we re going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Wha at?
Winning.
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
I ve been thinking. I ve been thinking about us. I m sorry I ve been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it s because you re the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn t handle it! I ve never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let s blow this town together. We ll run a bed and breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we ll dress up and kill anything that...
You were right all along the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie. I was making good money as a top architect but that s not who I am. I m not an architect, I m a..
You might be right, but Fun is overrated. I need something real.
Even the skylight?
Cactus, sometimes you don t deserve to wear our logo.
I don t want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet. After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won t stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don t tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
For when the.. Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of... gold. Uh...
The Mission is happening tonight.. It s up to you to... to save the City...
You know, my name s not Spooky. It s, it s Rachel.
" Pre bicentennial babe? "
Stop.
Oh Frank, I m not anti male, I m anti you. Believe me, there s a difference. Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning. There s something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
What if I were to say " Your Wife " as in does she know of your touching mentor student relationship with the post Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don t get me wrong this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It s just, I like her a lot.
I actually got some memory back last night.
Enough.
But of course you are.
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
Ah! You scared me! How did you know to come here! Have you been spying..
What did?
Yes, you shouted the words " Captain God " at me for no reason...
What?
About the same. Thanks for asking... Damn blender. Okay, I can t stand it anymore, I m dying to know Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7 11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it a Catwoman for a night?
I m having a hard time picking up your signal this morning What did you say?
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn t become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with " Brock Leviathan, architect. " I can t believe he ordered white wine. You do know white wine is not real wine...
Go together? Sure, why not? Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath.. Say in a deep voice, " A superhero s job is to protect... "
You can t figure me out. You re the strange one..
Not too cool...
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you re on a diet... The fact you re still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your " accident " have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
It s funny, I ve heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I ve heard of foregoing a career to start a family but I think you re onto something new, Selina. " Absolutely nothing " Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on... How s that for sarcasm?
Uh, it s just that woman out there that horrible Hag. She s the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter And now she s built a hut in the back.. Why did you...
What kind of name is " Brock Leviathan? "
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that... you have such pretty eyes...
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Do you always listen to what your mother says? Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you. Save the day..
I m sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
I m not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It s just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that s too complicated. It s a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don t care what s a crime and what s not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
Don t you have children?
Taking messages.
I m sure he ll be heartbroken.
This is my conversation. I ll say what I fucking please.
Oh. Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
You could ve made me lose my call.
I didn t hurt you.
Me, he won t stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
He s at it again. Like that night at the Emerald. This piece of Euro trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker s head into the wall. Meantime " Wifey " recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero s eye out. It took six stitches.
I m not finished. Under other circumstances I d gladly go out of my way. I don t understand why you just don t phone some other person.
Theo wants to talk again.
Then whose is it?
I got to get going. An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
You got it wrong. I m the one that s on your side.
Or relieve me of it later.
Can you make him stop!
Look, I ve got a wife. I don t care if either of you ever get caught.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn t suffocate.
Put those away. We can t have marks on his wrists.
It s taken care of.
Bullshit.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
Shit. There s the hotel. You overshot the driveway.
Make a " U " and go back.
Go ahead then. I m covering the receiver. She can t hear.
I improved on the fucking original.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
I m still in my cab jammed up in traffic. Are you there yet?
I was worried about you. Both of you.
I ve been trying to get someone anyone. For hours...
You don t understand.
Will you let me explain!
You may be our only chance. I don t know if I can do this again.
They smashed the phone. I ve been clicking the loose wires together hoping it d make a connection.
They re holding my husband downstairs.
They gave me pills to make me sleep. They didn t realize how much Seconal I m used to that I d have so much tolerance
I m sorry. I m so sorry to do this to you.
I don t believe you.
My name is
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
I realize you don t want to be involved.
You won t disconnect.
Because you know you ll be killing us.
They tortured my husband. Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts. Once they get what s in the safe deposit box they ll kill us.
I have no idea. They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows. The shutters up here are nailed shut.
No! No police. They ll know right away the authorities are looking for us. They ll kill us. We ve seen their faces.
One of them is a cop.
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club. Claimed we d run a stop sign. And when Elliot was reaching for his license
Elliot our driver. The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot s head and fired. It was so quick.
Then they took the Mercedes away with his body in it.
I m in traffic. There s no place to turn.
I hear them coming upstairs. I won t be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep. So don t talk. Don t say a word or they ll hear it.
They just walked out. The smaller man he must be Dominican or Haitian he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound. It s starting to hurt now real bad. A throbbing. I can t even take a deep breath.
Rachel! They re going after Rachel now and I can t stop them.
Rachel, my daughter. She s an honor student at Parker. My God, she s only nine.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Let me call the school tell them not to let her go.
Forget who I am. Where s this school located?
Even if I got there first she wouldn t go with me.
What about the others?
What are you doing now?
Forget about us. Just save Rachel.
They say she resembles me dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform. Please. Be careful. The man driving the car must have a gun.
How much time do you have left on it?
Why didn t you do what your friends wanted and just get rid of me?
A woman?
I didn t mean to open up any old wounds.
And that was the end of it?
I m sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
Sometimes I paint.
Pictures.
Lady, you don t have to keep up a running commentary.
Shit, stop with the money! I never asked for a nickel. I was just doing this. And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
A price on everything.
I m about ten blocks from the school.
That makes two of us.
I can hear you again, clearly.
No.
She s gone
It s not your fault, Theo. You tried.
The one in Brentwood.
What do you mean?
I heard someone pulling in behind the house. I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden. I don t know what they did to her.
Even if you found us what then?
Jack will negotiate with them. He ll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they ll let Rachel go.
Don t say that.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
It s not hard to do. I do it all the time.
Oh my God. I heard her scream again. What are they doing to her? Why can t I do anything to stop them?
To hide it from the I. R. S.
Don t talk. Don t talk!
The front door slammed. Someone went out. There s a different car starting.
If it s the tall man he had one of those hair transplants. Tufts, you know. It still hasn t grown fully in. The other one is from the islands. Braided hair very dark.
Theo, I want you to know, you re probably the most decent man I ve ever met.
But I guess we haven t really met have we?
Jack hasn t loved me for years. And now I m afraid she s turning out to be like him. So cold and distant. I ve let him make her like that.
Because you re probably the last person I ll ever talk to.
No.
Yes I think so. Another crossed line?
Downstairs. There must be an extension. Oh my God
Hi Lenore. It s me. I got you back. Courtesy of Star 69. Are you hurt?
Lucky for them they didn t.
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
I m in possession of the bag he was carrying. And I m in a position to negotiate. What about your husband and your child?
Are you okay?
That s coming off. How about the girl?
Your husband?
You re all three of you in that van?
Now you re going to do just what I tell you to. No discussion. No hesitation.
I m not leaving my daughter behind. Not with them.
I can t do it.
Yes.
Yes. But I want Rachel to come with me.
Why can t it be her?
All right. Now that you explain it I see that you re right.
She ll be with you soon. They re pulling up. They ll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
Why didn t you just shoot them?
You re going to let them get away with this?
They tortured us. And you re going to let them have all that money?
They put their hands all over me.
Why are you telling him that. Are you crazy?
There isn t any such person.
It belongs to the man you took it from. Or should I saw stole it from?
Jack Oberfeld in person. Did you kill him?
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I ll bet there were enough witnesses.
Plus they ll remember you going after his daughter at school.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
As they say no good deed goes unpunished.
I thought it was inspired.
Why pick me to be your " mark? "
L. A. P. D.
There s no way out for you. You have to deal with us.
He seems to think he s entitled to it all.
You won t shoot me. That s not your style.
Do you have to point that?
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
The one thing you don t want is to attract the police.
I don t hear him moving around anymore.
A typical fuck up.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
Naturally you didn t learn your lesson.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you. And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could ve seen your face.
You could ve hit me.
You wouldn t
Stop talking like that!
Inform him the fee is seventy five large for your return. All parts intact.
Plus names, addresses and I. D. for the lot of you. We re in this together and I need to know who my partners are. In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
No, there s a police car way back there. See it, in the distance coming around the turn? The van is blocking it now.
259 7881.
That s why we re turning off onto a fire road.
I can t hear. Now there s a siren. They must be in an ambulance. What about the money? Nels?
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen. We cleared some of these same roads.
That s where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas. I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
Why are we stopping?
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked. That angelic little face wasn t me at all. I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough but I wasn t beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously. I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was. That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
Sooner or later you ll learn to trust me.
The cop in the trunk he could still be alive.
He might ve heard everything we said in the car.
We can t leave him to repeat anything.
You re the man with the gun.
Naturally.
That s not good enough.
Took preparation.
You won t live to see it.
Turns out you did me a favor. You re looking at a rich man.
I don t want it.
Sure, like I m gonna take advice from you.
Call me " Nels. "
If you re looking for a quickie all you ve got to do is ask.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
The fuck I will!
There s two police cars now.
You want us to get ourselves killed?
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Nels! Guess who? A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
I thought you d know me by now.
I suppose you re in your taxi?
Intelligent question, Nels. I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
You could always disappear with what s already in your backpack.
Five minutes.
Take the Getty Center exit make a right onto Cisco. It ll be a narrow winding road. You can t miss the house. It s a mansion built back in 29 Spanish boarded up since the quake.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
How do you know?
I ve got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
None of your business, but it s in the cab. That s all mine. When we take from them, we divide, eighty twenty.
In your dreams.
Them. They won t be expecting us.
Who are you?
There s no lady here.
Hold on.
You ve got a phone?
Government business?
Undercover.
Is that good or bad?
So who s he?
Then why doesn t she?
How?
She s not a girl, Col
See what, Dil?
Yeah?
What would you call it?
What do you think his name is?
Persistent.
An excellent quality.
Hi.
Stop it, Dil
Saw it, Dil.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Did I?
Who the fuck is he?
It s him, isn t it?
Don t throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off, Dave.
She s not a tart.
What?
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Not in my experience.
In a way.
Guy I work with.
What s it to you?
No.
Scottish?
The accent, I suppose.
Who s she?
Not me.
Yes, thank you.
He wants me to perform for him.
You know.
No, I didn t
Where?
What look?
They re jealous.
Like what?
How special?
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Yes, please.
Must be in love to manage that.
How different?
Tell me about him.
Shouldn t I go?
Yes...
Maybe.
What do you think?
You say that like a gentleman.
Didn t think I could.
Is this an obsession of yours?
He did sometimes.
Want to look after you.
What is this?
Aha.
Depends what it is.
I m thinking of your man.
I m wondering why you keep his things.
No...
Dil
What you doing here?
Don t call me that.
Give it over, Dil
Must be.
Do you care, Jimmy?
You mean that?
Shut up.
I said stop it.
You think that s wise?
That s a start.
Make it up to me, then.
Ask to meet me again.
When?
Know what, honey?
Can t help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
So they do know.
Sorry.
Probably.
You can always pretend.
Absolutely.
Are you pretending yet?
A little.
Please, Jimmy.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Don t be cruel.
He d bring me carnations.
Not at all, honey.
Why, honey
You gonna tell me why?
What s her?
Kind of.
Yes.
You could say that.
I m not sure.
Anything.
Afraid so.
A girl has to draw the line somewhere
It s a secret.
Yes.
No.
What?
For me.
I m going home!
I was trying to get out of something.
You mean that?
Prescription. For my condition.
Jimmy?
You knew which man?
You knew my Jody?
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
In a manner of speaking.
No.
I suppose I tried.
Stop it, Dil
Got to be somewhere.
I like you, Dil
I like you, DIl
Yes.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Love you, Dil.
Yeah.
Never.
It s my name, Dil
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn t she?
Tell me what she wore.
Do I?
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Will I see you again?
I promise.
The Metro.
Stop it, Dil
Thirty five.
Fergus.
Please, Dil
As the man said, it s in my nature.
You know her, Jimmy?
Ever so nice. Aren t you, Jimmy?
Well, maybe you ll get lucky. Someday.
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
That s wise, Tommy.
Need to go across the water.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Horny bastard.
There are certain things I wouldn t do for my country.
Can t.
He s all right.
He s hot.
Leave me alone, Jude.
I heard.
I know.
He ran. I couldn t shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
Yes.
No, what is the thing?
What do you mean?
No way, Jude. I m out.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Was I?
And what happens then?
And what if you don t?
You may be right.
Yes?
I take pride in my work.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
The poor whore s suffocating in the heat.
And anyway, he s seen our faces.
Thanks.
It s nothing. He s just got a sense of humor, that s all.
I told him.
You ll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
And do you know why?
I m a volunteer, am n t I?
Peter.
Would make me feel better about it.
I m sure.
Who d you think it was?
And who s Dave when he s at home?
Should blow you away, you know that?
I understand.
Definitely unusual.
Just a girl.
Aye, I do, Peter.
A hotel?
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Good. So what do you think?
Right.
Right.
Can t.
How is it a farce?
So, what do I look like?
Am I?
No fucking way.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you re no pinup.
Nope. Not handsome at all.
No. It s the truth.
Could you?
What is it now?
Do what?
They re going to let that guy die. And you re going to kill me.
You want to bet?
And even if he doesn t die you can t just let me loose.
Not in your nature.
I m talking about your people, not you.
Only that you re all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it s not in your nature to let me go.
And you know the funny thing?
No.
What?
Don t you think of it, fucker.
She s mine. Anyway, she wouldn t suit you.
Absolutely not.
Don t I know it.
You fuckers set me up. That bitch
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I m saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I m looking at her saying I don t like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I ll get to understand.
What the fuck were you doing here?
You could have said no.
Why did you sign up?
Shouldn t take it personally.
And you play cricket?.
Ever see hurling?
Best game in the world.
How different?
Hurry up, would you?
Shut up, would you?
Yeah?
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Don t be so sure.
Doesn t matter where.
Having a pint in the Rock.
Like what?
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil s having a margarita.
My special friend.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we re finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
I ve often wondered how you do it.
What do you believe in?
It s as simple as that?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Dil wasn t trouble. No trouble at all.
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I m thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
Want you to do something, Fergus.
If they kill me
I don t know her.
I told you not to talk that way
How can I?
I don t want to sleep. Tell me something.
A story.
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
Yeah?
Why?
Stop that talk now
The fastest.
Cricket s in the halfpenny place.
You won t run.
What you say, faster?
Hurling
You didn t?
Who gives a fuck.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
You re crazy
Where are you, ol buddy?
The letter? The letter ain t worth nuthin.
You greenhorn you half witted, thick skulled, hare brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
There has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
I think that s what you ordered.
How was I leading you on?
That s right.
What would you like me to say that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
It s a toss up, I can tell you that.
What about it?
Why do you think I brought you here?
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
You re going to look for him now?
Adam
Why?
I ve looked, Adam you know I have
Lord, you re stubborn.
Let s look anyway.
To the apartment it matches mine perfectly.
Well, I guess that s it dead end.
I love you, Adam.
No, it s all right. What s wrong, Adam?
Can you remember anything at all?
With whom? Where?
Think, Reggie, you ve got to think it may be what we re looking for.
Nonsense. We didn t steal it. There s no law against stealing stolen money.
There is? Well, I can t say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie please think what was written in Charles notebook?
Five o clock Thursday the Garden it s got to be something around here.
I know, but this is all we ve got left.
It s all right I don t think Tex does, either.
Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I ve seen him! He said Dyle did it!
But Tex didn t he still thought!
You lied to me so many times
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
And that s all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
I heard you, I heard you.
Reggie listen to me
I ll give you a chance, Dyle which is more than you d give me. Where s the money?
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle where is it?
Then who does?
Me?
Reggie?
No cat and mouse you ve got me. What do you want to know?
I had to for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
But you know my name it s Dyle.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it Tex, Gideon and Scobie and your husband because he wouldn t go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I m trying to prove it. They think I m working with them. But I m not, and that s the truth. I m on your side, Reggie please believe that.
I met a man with sharp nails.
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Would you like to see my passport?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Okay, I ll drive you around there some day. Ouch!
Alexander.
Yes, but we re divorced.
I m no easier to live with than he was.
Alex how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
There must be some way.
Why couldn t you just look at his feet?
Oh. Well, then he s a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Which one are you?
Reggie listen to me
So was Juliet at fifteen.
Well, there s your trouble right there you re too old for me.
There, you said it.
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that s the last word he ever wants to hear. I don t want to be serious and I especially don t want you to be.
Okay.
Cutting it out.
You did.
That sounds like their problem.
Tuesday.
Scobie he s the one that objected.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Why?
Do women think it s feminine to be so illogical or can t they help it?
A  It s always the person you don t suspect; B  that means you think it s Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C  if you think it s Tex, it has to be someone else Gideon.
Who?
What like Scobie?
Alex
I m scared.
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex that means we re in his way, too.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie we ve got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Shut the door!
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie and the one who s going to be next me?
How can I believe it when you don t even know who the killer is? I ve got that right, haven t I? You don t know who did it.
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn t it? Whoever s left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn t you say so?
It s a start, anyway.
I can t very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Fiction or non fiction?
Well!
Go on.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
What do you mean?
You mean, you re a thief?
I don t believe it.
But I do believe it that s what I don t believe. So it s goodbye Alexander Dyle Welcome home Peter Joshua.
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you ve had three names in the past two days? I don t even know who I m talking to any more.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
I m I m sorry I don t know anything about stamps.
How much is it worth?
I m afraid it is important.
Do you mind if I sit down? What about the blue one?
What s its value today?
In money.
Do you have anything to eat? And the orange one what about the orange one?
And the last one?
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur F  lix are they for sale now?
And if it is?
Not unless we re blind.
Meaning what?
You know I d tell you if I had it.
What do you want?
Tell me what?
I don t know anything.
Leave me alone!
But his mother
It s hers. Where d you find him, robbing a bank?
Why, do you think we re going to?
I m afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn t possibly meet anyone else.
Quitter.
I m afraid you re blocking my view.
The one you re blocking. This is the last chance I have I m flying back to Paris this afternoon. What s your name?
I m Regina Lampert.
Yes.
No, it isn t. I m getting a divorce.
No, you see, I don t really love him.
Yes, I am I m compulsive about it dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste the small size and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size that the large size is the smallest size there is.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
That wasn t a proposal I was just curious.
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms now we re trying it with cities. What do people call you Pete?
Now you re angry.
Oh. Well, wasn t it Shakespeare who said: " When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again "?
How do you know?
Well, the idea s right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Charles is.
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am and to find out if there was anything I could do.
It s in all the afternoon papers. I m very sorry.
Charles sold it all at auction.
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
I m a simultaneous translator like Sylvie, only she s English to French I m French to English. That s what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Something like that. But I m sorry it ended like this tossed off a train like a sack of third class mail.
I don t know where to go.
Not too expensive I m not a lady of leisure anymore.
You telephoned me to meet you. I ve been standing on the corner back there waiting for you.
Don t you understand French?
Fun and games. Evidently we re the floorshow.
I I m not sure if I m supposed to tell you or not.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
That s what I m not supposed to say.
Stop bullying me. Everybody s bullying me.
How do you shave in there?
What was what?
Look, I know it s asking you to stretch your imagination, but can t you pretend for a moment that I m a woman and that you re a
Where?
How would you like a spanking?
Then stop acting like one. If you re really in some kind of trouble, I d like to hear about it. Otherwise, it s late, I m tired and I m going home to bed.
What?
I think I sprained my pride. Where d he go?
Be careful, Peter.
There are three men he s one of them they think I have something that belongs to them.
That s all.
I don t know. Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
Please help me, Peter you re the only one I can trust.
That s all right it s a drip dry.
Usually it s because they want something and they re afraid the truth won t get it for them.
He he said if I didn t give the money, he ll kill me.
I believe what he said.
How do you know what they re doing?
What are you talking about?
Words can hurt very much.
Don t put yourself out.
Yes, I ll remember. Good night.
Yes?
No no, I m don t.
Please stop please!
 a alors! From Charles?
But what?
Because I don t love him.
Didn t Charles have any friends?
I ve never seen him before.
How can you tell?
Don t be silly he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
Hello, Reggie I am waiting for Jean Louis.
He was so excited when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
The stamp market, of course it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean Louis trades his
What s the matter, ch  rie?
What?
Don t be un neighborly like, Herman don t forget he done us a little ol favor.
I m Lisa Sherman. Dylan s aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
I never fucked Rod.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
Not my imports.
That s an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
I get the imports.
No.
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn t you ask Jody that?
So?
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don t feel guilty about?
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let s figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we re going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
That s impossible.
Daddy you scared me!
It won t happen again.
Dad! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
I want you to head right home after school.
What s wrong?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
I m not criticizing.  Did you two get any further?
How much further?
I wouldn t ask if I didn t have to.
Daddy, are you upset that I m still a virgin?!
You are upset.
I thought you d be pleased.
Are you sure?
It can t be.
No I wasn t.
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn t say goodbye.
There s a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I m going.
No?
Are you sure?
She s still a virgin.
This will relax her.
I m looking for Lisa Sherman.
You know where I can find her?
She works at a church?
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
I never met the woman. I m just taking care of the place until they sell it.
I can.
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
Couldn t tell she going to off herself, huh?
I ve been in a lot of people s houses and this one s the creepiest.
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Daddy....
You re not?
Who s?
Jesus. Any word from Brent?
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I ll head over to the school.
What?
I m sure you should have failed.
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don t you come on over and clean those cuts up.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
Of course I m scared.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
Really?
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
Who?
Why?
I don t watch him eat everyday.
You eventually have to talk to him.
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
You are sp fucking wrong.
Does she fuck?
I was desperate. It was gross.
He says he loves me.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
You re the one always saying Just do it.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S  M chat room...
You watch. There s going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I ll finally talk to Mark Shale.
FINE. Are you?
What?
What party?
Ok.
I won t.
You re thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Didn t you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
Stag?
I can t right now.
Why?
What?
I m fine.
I did.
Yeah. I think it s really sick.
Three of our classmates are dead. That s not really the occasion for a party.
Did Sharon say no?
I m so flattered but I can t. I m grounded.
I m not using him as an excuse.
I do not.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
I ll think about it.
My dad acts like he s Johnny Fucking Perfect and he s really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
I can t believe I listened to one word of his shit.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
That s not why we broke up.
Sharon s far from a slut.
What?
Hi princess.
Yes?
You can ask me anything.
Yeah. Who is she?
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she s the killer.
That s what he said.
No but he got really weird. Like I ve never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Who is she?
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
What?
Attacked how?
You didn t believe her?
Why not?
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them queers?
And the police did nothing?
How could you?
The word is Mob.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
The principal?
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
I m Kenny s Aunt Lisa.
His mother s side.
Just thinking about something.
There s going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn t caught.
I got to go.
Did you want one?
So are you.
Ok.
No.
What?
Yeah. I m extremely worried about that. It s right up there with global warming.
If sheep don t count.
I know. I m kidding you. Chill out.
You re being unfair.
Okay, okay.

Oh...

You re fucked, man.

And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...

So you took his...
So I took his truck, yeah.
We were nationally ranked.
Started every game my senior year. Not all American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback. Got taken in the first round.
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar. I was drivin.
... hospital.
Couldn t deal with it. So I split.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin for Darlene.
We got two paddles.
... for whatever it s worth, I m sorry I dragged you into this...
To tell you the truth, you didn t.
I mean, if that gun was...
... er. It was your friend...
... shit.
... split.
... miles.
That is loud! I m
Hey. Mason.
I think you oughta cut a...
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
... or my conscience.
... man.

Are you all right?

Huh?
We re gonna die!
We re gonna die!

What?
We re gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
Reach into my pocket.
Come on!
Okay.
Okay.
Okay. All right, man. Okay.
Okay.





Go, go, go!

That s why I didn t give it...

Sometimes the prey bites back.

What the?
What s it say?
What?


It s working.

We got...
Vitelli! Vitelli!
There s gotta be...
Hold this.

Let s go!
Arlo, I m gonna get Elvis. You go.
Okay. Come on, big guy!
Look out.
Why d you stay behind?!



They aren t exactly gonna publicize this, Arlo.

Excuse me. I got a bullet in my leg.
Who drove the ice cream...
Who had to put a gun to your head?
... that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
Hello.
Right. You damn skippy. And now that I am both jobless...
... I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
I think so too.
Thank you.
What about all that " no need to get in the man s...
I was not in the man s face. I was nego...
Look. That s negotiating? He threatened to kill...
But he didn t. See, that s negotiation.
That s bullshit.
Oh, oh!
Yeah.
Yeah.

Yeah.
Big balls.
Hey, be cool.
That was quick.
To tell you the truth, we re looking for a scientist who s gone missing from the Tech Center. Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
... about him.
... within five minutes.
Listen, shithead!
... frozen! So if you don t mind!
This country trained me to kill...
Well, well, well.
And it won t be pleasant.
... such is the price... of patriotism.
Mason, you have to take this...
Wait. This town is full of trucks. Nice new trucks. You don t need to go...
I had no idea how powerful it was.
... onds... with just a fraction of what s in...

You You can t let him...
... lem too?

He s the dude...
... Mason. I can barely hear you.
... on ice! We ve got Elvis on ice!
Thank you.
... owe you.
... and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
However, you are also non en...
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
... including the permanently extreme.
... tor Long.
... to be off the island tonight.
I don t work for you, Captain Brynner.
You know, captain, if you hadn t spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might ve found yourself with more gold leaf on your col...
This isn t some kind of pissing contest, Long. You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi...
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
... sittin here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar! And let me tell you something else. I didn t join the service to let people like you turn...
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
Now, I know. You have moral objections to what we re doing here, but believe...
You have my word on that.
... destroyer of worlds. "
No!
You ll kill us all!
... I wish they would ve let me say something...
Is this stool taken?
You look good, Richard.
... not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo...
Is that why you re here? To blame...
I know where the blame belongs. But I didn t put you in prison, Andrew. The government did...
Oh, I m well aware of what the government did, I assure you. Actually, I ve just come to say how grateful I am to you...
Grateful?
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
... you were right, of course. But after...
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you ve...
Do you think I haven t seen the bodies of those...
Went away?
Almost quaint.
... I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
So far, ye yes.
... happen if I drop this?
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
Pleasant surprise.
And I certainly can t say it s pleasant.
I checked your release date. I never liked coincidences.
... ians. But I assure you, Leo...
... enworth. I ll have no compunction at all about using this.
Or I may be wrong. The breeze could be gusting south. That d be Billings...
... Destry, Fair Oaks....
... here!
I ll do it.
Closin down, sir.
All right. Let s clear the mess and move out.
Radio the bikes.
And so Missoula s prodigal son returns.
Check the immediate area.
... quick in and out.
... ther orders?
You can t fire on them. You re gonna detonate the crystals.
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn. Take these two behind the van.
Get your links set up!
... here!
We re gonna use them for demonstration footage.
Get em in the middle of the dam.
... in Missoula. All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
Officer Pappas, I m glad you re here.
I m Colonel Brynner, U. S. Special Operations Com...
We were called in by the Jerome base...
... ty.
You know the suspect?
... general store.
That s right.
... fall.
But...
... screwup?
... noon.
... scientists.
Where s their protective...
It s a hundred degrees...
Mornin.
Yeah, they call me Dar...
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
I assume you want that to go.
... dangerous.
... deer.
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it s cool with me. But mostly, well, they just take a six...
... look like you re after something more dangerous.
I assume you have one.
... Long.
... time to time, yeah.
... though.
Odd, then, that his car...
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
... and ask a simple question Are you actually prepared...
... never done a thing for you?
... on this miserable road to nowhere.
You try anything, it goes in...
It s a little late for matinee heroics, Mason. Just give me the con...
Where s Arlo?
Your fellow hero, untouched...
... spite the mouth.





Where s Elvis?!
... checked.



You d never understand!

Goddamn it, Ma...
... and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
Darlene, it s five thirty. Now, I worked late for you this mornin, and you didn t wanna spring for over...
Oh. Well, I have got to get to the dentist be...
I can handle it.
Be sure you feed Bosco.
... like April. It gives him gas. And make sure there s two pots of coffee...
... ready before the morning crowd blows in.
Story of my life. Well, one thing you won t lose is that friend of yours back there, I ll tell you that.
Oh, you re two of a kind, doc. Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...
... he s smart enough to get you...
There s something else too.
Secrets.
His I know. Yours I don t have a clue. But if it wasn t for you, I think he d have drifted right on through this town.
You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.
You got thirty minutes.
Go.
Kabula s out.
... now!
... we re gonna seal that tunnel! I want it air...
Sir, we can t just let him get away with this!
What s going on, colonel?
... son.
It must ve happened right after we left.
Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer. Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?

Uh huh.
... colonel?
One of our units is pursuing a suspect up the thirty...
Who s your suspect?
... son.
Couldn t sleep, Pumper. Is everything, uh, all right tonight?

... try this one out some...
Excellent.
Been trying to figure out your secret.
Yeah. Ten months we ve been fishin this river together. We use the same equipment, more or less...
And I m good at this. Been doing it since I was a kid. But you, I don t know. Somehow you think...
No, that s not possible, Mason. The trout...
He s brains without ambition...
... the master of his realm.
There s only one way you can do it, Mason.
Tie a fly...
... forcing him to strike. And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey... can bite...
... and that power...
... is death.
... to a simple thing like...
Shit! Oh, shit.
... or it ll ignite.
Never let it reach fifty degre degrees.
The only one who understands what this me...
Tryin to remember somethin somebody once told me about tyin a fly.
... that the prey can bite back.
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
How much longer for the range and power projections?
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
... son.
We ve got the real thing!
... Mason?
Forty seven.
... tunnel!
... uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin?
Do you recognize this young man?
... lem?
... badge someday, then you can ask the questions. Until then...
Got that?
... selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
... seriously.
Mason, you wouldn t know the truth if it bit you. We ve got your whole record. We know about the the conviction for vagrancy...
I didn t sell the boy any...
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
You know, I gotta tell you. That really bothers me, somebody calls me " son. "
... hands!
You redneck idiot, do you have...
Yeah, asshole. I m puttin a murder suspect and a guy who...

... there s a colonel...
His name s Vitelli. Talk to him. He s right out...
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
... we re all gonna die in this...
Just go check the temperature.
The Army, sealin us in.
I ll lead em out.
You sure?
All right, go.
The usual. Doc.


... damn phone.

He must ve had a damn arsenal in there.
Take it easy, Jake.
' Course you do, Jake.
That s right.
If that s what it says.
Sir, this is not a lending library, it s the Hall of Records.
A ruler?
I said horseshit. Horseshit.
Thanks.
It doesn t hurt.
Probably.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Who s the investigating officer?
Do you know him?
Where from?
Would you call him a capable man?
Honest?
Of course, but you ve got no reason to think he s bungled the case?
That s too bad.
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you re taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
Mr. Gittes! You re dealing with a disturbed woman who s lost her husband. I don t want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
It s what the D. A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
Mainly that you re rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
His girlfriend?
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Yeah.
No. She s probably scared to death.
Maybe.
You didn t see Mulwray much, did you?
My daughter.
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I d like to help her if I can.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
How did you find out?
Okay. My secretary ll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
I ll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
I ve got her.
She s fine.
What is it?
Hollie was always fond of tide pools. You know what he used to say about them?
That s where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide pools... he was fascinated by them... you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You d lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
No, Mr. Gittes. That s what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There ll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I m doing it.
That s all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L. A. or you bring L. A. to the water.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
Oh, my, yes.
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where s the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
What can I tell you, Kid? You re right. When you re right, you re right, and you re right.
You know, you re okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it s your job, but you re okay.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
Oh they don t?
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
No thanks.
Curly, where s your car?
Where s that?
Could you drive me somewhere?
Right now, Curly. It can t wait.
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we re going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie s sick.
I don t know...
Plus what I owe you?
You sure this is okay?
Jake, listen.
Okay.
I said okay, Jake.
I ve been wanting to meet you.
Did you know that you re a very wealthy woman?
Well you own a lot of land.
The apple core club.
No. The albacore. It s a fish. My grandson s a member and they take very nice care of us.
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but 
How are you, Lou?
Summer colds are the worst.
How d you get past the guards?
I get by.
Since when?
Uh huh. So what are you doing here?
Who?
Oh yes.
No.
No?
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
Didn t you call?
I don t.
Is it? I forget. I don t call myself that often.
I don t think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I ll get back to you. Now I d like to go home.
What pictures?
Yeah?
I heard it was an accident.
You accusing me of extortion?
I don t think I need a day or two. You re even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I d never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that s where I draw the line, Escobar.
And why s that?
Too late for what?
Matter of fact I do.
Her maid s house. I think she knows something s up.
She lives in Pedro. I ll write it down for you.
What for?
Gee, Lou, I m doing the best I can.
Yeah.
I guess not.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don t know what s going on. Let her go. I ll explain it later.
Let her go. She didn t kill anybody.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don t know.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
Of course.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Do you know where she might be?
He... we did... he wouldn t tell me her name. We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
Yes.
A private investigator?
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we ve never met, you must also agree that I haven t hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you re going to get it.
What are you having?
Actually he s not. And he s moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
Mr. Gittes, you ve talked me into it. I ll drop the lawsuit.
Mrs. Mulwray?
Why?... What on earth for? Look, Hollis seems to think you re an innocent man.
What do you mean?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
It s very personal. It couldn t be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Looks like you went quite a distance.
I ll stop by.
... Just a minute...
Well, how much would you like?
I have?
It wasn t much of a lie.
How did you find out?
Why?
Did you have affairs?
Did he know?
Where you were when your husband died.
You mean you don t know where you were?
That your maiden name?
No. I m just a snoop.
No, not for that one.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Wait a minute, sonny. I think you better come with me.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don t know.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no. Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don t think my father felt that way. Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven t spoken to this day.
Of course I m sure.
What dam?
The Valley?
No.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
No, I think I d remember.
And Hollis knew about it?
What? What is it?
Is that unusual?
They can t be.
Why?
I gave everybody the night off.
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
What s that, Mrs. Mulwray?
Actually this hasn t happened to me in some time.
Why?
What were you doing there?
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
Yeah.
You can t always tell what s going on there.
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
Your eye.
There s something black in the green part of your eye.
... A flaw...
Just... I have to.
Please don t be angry... believe me, it s got nothing to do with you.
Please!... Trust me this much... I ll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
It has to do with my father.
He owns it. You know?
You saw my fa... father? When?
You didn t tell me.
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
Give me an example.
That s what your father said. You re telling me he s in back of this whole thing?
Including the death of your husband?
You bastard.
The police?
She s not tied up!
I am not!
What about?
You mean she just found out?
That s not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
Like she knows about Hollis death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
You won t go to the police if I tell you?
Aren t you coming back with me?
Sure.
Where s the girl?
I want to see her.
What are you doing? What s wrong? I told you we ve got a 4: 30.
What did you do that for?
No...
I don t know. I mean yes, probably.
What are you saying?
... no...
Katherine.
Back to Mexico.
How about a plane?
I have to go home and get my things.
Where can we go?
With us.
I m all right.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
Of course.
Oh, good.
I don t think so. Be happy to show you.
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It s nearly bedtime.
J. J. Gittes. And it s not a departmental matter.
And Mulwray isn t?
I m sorry, I
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
I cut myself shaving.
Only when I breathe.
I never was.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton. Mulwray didn t want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
That s like saying they re in Arizona.
Yes...
Yes...
Si.
What about the water?
When it comes? What d you tell him?
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
It s not completely dry.
Yeah. Do you have any references?
That s swell. But how about here? Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Yeah.
He s not in, Mr.?
May I ask what this is regarding?
Since lunch.
He was expecting you?
Well I m on my lunch hour. I ll wait.
Yes. No.
Yes.
Yes.
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you ll just read the display.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig n Whistle.
I don t know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing  apple core.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
Yeah. What s wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find em, sue em. We ll make a killing. We ll have dinner at Chasen s twice a week, we ll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Jake, it s Chinatown. They re all over the place. You oughta know better.
I m going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
I m working for his daughter.
She ain t exactly long in the tooth now.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
She ran away?
Well, you never know, do you?
Why d she run away?
You don t say?
So I can have these?
Fifty lire...
But you don t have any kids!!!
Then why don t you want to teach it to me too? Now that there s no more cranking, and it s easier?
Then why don t you change jobs?
No...
But don t you like anything about what you do?
Who knows?... It s like an adventure. Hope springs eternal...
OK. OK. But now that I ve got a job, I 11 probably stop going...
Why? What do you mean?
That s right, Modern Times.
Yes.
Nothing, there s nothing. It s all out of focus.
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
Heeey! Totooooo! Don t get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don t know where the fuck I have to go. And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
I want to make you happy, Toto! I m going to tell you a story. Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king s daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king s daughter?!... One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn t live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I ll be yours. Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty... Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn t hold them back. He didn t even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch... And on the ninety ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
Just so, Alfredo. There isn t any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
I m here! Take it easy! Take it easy! Sit down, sit down... Did she come?
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That s right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And... that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him...
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh?
Oh yes, father. Now everything s clear.
Hi. Why are you running?
Yes, nice day.... I ve got to go now. Bye bye.
We ll talk about that later.
For what?
Good, this way we can finally talk. I ll convince him this time.
Who?
Don t be silly... I m old. Don t look at me like that, please. Why d you come back?
One or two. Bur there re not all that many Salvatores. I ve got a son, too... he s older. And you, do you have children?
Sure, sure! Boccia... What s he do?
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
No...
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush... Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
Go on!
I didn t see that.
I can t take shorthand.
Re figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
Ready for dinner, Brad?
I can t take shorthand, Mr. Kane
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see every floor guaranteed let s hope it bothers them it cost us enough.
You re right, Mr. Bernstein.
We certainly do. Vacation s over starting right after dinner. But right now that lady over there that s the new society editor, I take it? You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
You don t really think so?
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning
We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word as he was dying
Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed
I m calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I m calling on you.
Well, I went down to Atlantic City
You know why? She was so
I m going back there.
Nobody else, but I ve been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher s. That journal of his
He made an awful lot of money.
I guess Mr. Kane didn t think so well of Susie s art anyway.
Well, then, how could he write that roast? The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
It didn t end very well, did it?
Yes
In case you d like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he s at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me. Just
Charlie?!
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the " Enquirer " who were with the " Chronicle " until yesterday weren t they just as devoted to the " Chronicle " kind of paper as they are now to our kind of paper?
Certainly not. So what s that got to do with it? Mr. Kane, he ll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Don t I always? Most of the time?
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein. There doesn t seem to be an serious injury.
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
Thank you, Mr Carter. This is Mr. Leland.
Are they standing for me?
Ask them to sit down.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
I m going to live right here. As long as I have to.
There is no news big enough.
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon. Our man even arrived before the " Chronicle " reporter. And there s no proof that the woman was murdered or even that she s dead.
It s not our function to report the gossip of housewives. If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
Thank you. I can t imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake. The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
I m protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane. This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn t have a chance to he couldn t be elected Dog Catcher. Well, what I m interested in is seeing that he s not elected. I don t care whether they know what I know about him. Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral Champeen of the people. Just as long as
I m surprised he got the votes he did.
Why should anyone vote for him? He s made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him. And they re supposed to be grateful and love and adore him because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
There aren t any personal lives for people like us. He made that very clear to me nine years ago If I d thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I d have left him then
Maybe I should have the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
Brad, I m I m not an old woman yet
He s paying for it, Emily. Those returns tonight he s finished. Politically socially, everywhere, I guess. I don t know about the papers, but
Emily you musn t leave me now you can t do that to me.
But I d arranged to go home with you myself.
It can wait.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
I don t see what else you can do, Charles. If he s right and the papers publish this story he has
Charles, this this story doesn t concern only you. I ll be in it, too, won t I? And Junior?
I don t think so. Are you coming, Charles?
You decided what you were going to do, Charles some time ago. You can t always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened. Come on, Charles.
Charlie, please don t
What s the matter with you?
You re no Venus de Milo.
I m sorry. They live here, too?
I can t stay here all night chasing your pain away.
On the chiffonier. Here.
I ve got a brush in the closet. As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry you just brush it off.
No. But you re close.
You re getting farther away all the time. It s a duck.
You really don t know who I am?
But you like me, don t you? Even though you don t know who I am?
And I know too many people. Obviously, we re both lonely. Would you like to know where I was going tonight when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
Oh, me
I didn t say.
Pretty old. I ll be twenty two in August.
I work at Seligman s.
I want to be a singer. I mean, I didn t. Mother did for me.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Oh, you wouldn t want to hear me sing.
Well, I
Oh, no, that s all gone.
Half past eleven.
Half past eleven.
Yes. The bulldog s just gone to press.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
You may be right I sometimes wonder but you get into the habit
I was referring to myself. I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight. Invite everybody to go to the Everglades
You re in a tent, darling. You re not at home. And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
I ve got more than a right as far as you re concerned, Susan.
You re my wife, Susan, and
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan. Right now
As far as you re concerned, Susan, I ve never wanted anything I don t want anything now except what you want.
Susan, I really think
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Susan, it seems to me
I m not sorry.
No, you re not.
Don t go, Susan.
In case you don t know, Emily, this this gentleman is
Get out! I ve got nothing to talk to you about. If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
Your job isn t to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You re supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
If you re interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit. The newspapers, for instance. I m an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco... It s all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason. Aren t you, maestro?
Your mother won t be going right away, Charles
I don t know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher. I just try everything I can think of.
They re all part of your general attack your senseless attack on everything and everybody who s got more than ten cents in his pocket. They re
Charles, my time is too valuable for me
Yes, sir.
Can t say, sir.
Do you know what that is?
Persia. It belonged to a king.
He was dead... That s a poem. Do you know what it means?
It s been a tough day.
Our readers are, anyway, I don t know about the rest of the country.
But there is no Front, Charlie. There s a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don t want the job.
How would the " Enquirer " look with no news about this non existent war with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
Yes?
Good.
Charlie
It doesn t make any difference about me, but one of these days you re going to find out that all this charm of yours won t be enough
Charlie
Do you think you re the one who should call him a great man?
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor. What do you think that crowd is doing down there? They think you murdered him.
And that copy of the " Enquirer " said the President should be killed.
You ve said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
Charlie!
What lesson? Not to expose fraud when I see it? Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property? Run it the way I said, Reilly " This afternoon a great man was assassinated "
I don t have to. I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they re getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can t help that. Besides, they all know I m married to his niece. I ve got to think of her.
I ve got to think of Emily
What s wrong, Brad?
Why, Brad?
She s going to leave you
Brad, you are drunk.
Why is she leaving me?
Do you think the " Enquirer " shouldn t have campaigned against the oil leases?
The personal note is all there is to it. It s all there ever is to it. It s all there every is to anything! Stupidity in our government, complacency and self satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong you can t fight those things impersonally. They re not impersonal crimes against people. They re being done by actual persons with actual names and positions and the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
Are you finished?
You re not going to like it in Chicago. They wind comes howling in from the lake. And there s practically no opera season at all and the Lord only knows whether they ve ever heard of Lobster Newburg
I know you will.
Yes.
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
Rogers isn t even pretending. He isn t just scared anymore. He s sick. Frank Norris told me last night he hasn t known Rogers to be that worried in twenty five years.
That s what you think, is it, Jim?
You don t happen to have a cigar, do you? I ve got a young physician must remember to ask to see his license the odds are a hundred to one he hasn t got one who thinks I m going to stop smoking... I changed the subject, didn t I? Dear, dear! What a disagreeable old man I ve become. You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane? Well I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself. He never gave himself away He never gave anything away. He just left you a tip. He had a generous mind. I don t suppose anybody ever had so many opinions. That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it But he didn t believe in anything except Charlie Kane. He never had a conviction in his life. I guess he died without one That must have been pretty unpleasant. Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death. But we do know what we re leaving... we believe in something. You re absolutely sure you haven t got a cigar?
Never mind Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn t he? Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then. He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
It s a letter from her lawyers.
Rawlston is my boss.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially That s the answer we got.
Was he in love?
Yes.
That must have been love.
Sure.
Sure, Mr. Leland. I ll be glad to.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can t answer it.
Yes, sir.
But don t you think if we release it now he s only been dead four days it might be better than if
Queer?
Sentimental fellow, aren t you?
Well, thanks a lot.
Millions if anybody wants it.
Oh! I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
If you d just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
I d rather you just talked. Anything that comes into your mind about yourself and Mr. Kane.
What did you get?
He married you, didn t he?
What about that apartment?
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same
Monday, with some of the boys from the office. Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully all that art stuff. We run a picture magazine, you know
Am I sure?
Am I sure about what?
Are you serious?
What the hell is that?
You re shittin me.
It s a trach ring. It s what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty year old man.
It s never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead. Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
It s a picture of a cancer ridden lung. Keep it.
Do you mind if I drink this here?
No, I think I ll drink it in here, thanks.
Now he s going to launch into his rap about how he s just doing his job; following orders. Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn t care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, " Have a nice day. "
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody s giving these fine people a wake up call?!
We re not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
I take it she likes the guy.
Children s programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren t engaged anymore?
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Can I watch?
Can I join in?
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
Exactly.
He went home to change for the big date.
No, this is great.
There s no light back there.
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five fourteen every night.
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn t want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
And I m caught in the middle torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
You re very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
It was so cool. He didn t say a word. He was just... ready, you know? And we didn t kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
Just now.
Let s not talk about that. How d you get home?
I want to talk to you about something, and I don t want to be disturbed.
Very dramatic, I thought.
What, it s worse? You re pregnant with an Asian design major s child?
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
You could ve broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
And you said yes?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
How do you know that?
So you re really getting married?
No, you re not really getting married?
How like her.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
But you were.
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you re ready to walk down the aisle I d say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
What?
Sang? His name is a past tense?
If he s so nice, why aren t you going to marry him?
There s more, isn t there?
Tell me I don t have something to do with it.
You lie.
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I m the impetus behind your failure to wed.
Jesus, you re caustic.
So who s asking? I don t want to marry you.
But can we date?
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it s time we got back together, you know. I m more mature, you re more mature, you re finishing college, I m already in the job market...
Cute. Tell me you wouldn t want to go out again. After all the talking we ve been doing.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we re dating?
Let me take you out tonight.
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
You have a better suggestion?
I hear that s a rather popular date.
What about Sing?
Sang.
He s your fianc .
So what are you saying?
I m just kidding.
I ll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn t gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I ll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
Who doesn t?
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
I left like an hour ago.
Like what?
It wasn t me.
We didn t just have sex in the bathroom?
I m not kidding. I just got back from outside.
What time was this?
Just me.
We did.
Nobody. It was closed.
Shock trauma. She s going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
Yeah.
Excuse me?
We re sorry, ma am. We got a little carried away.
In a second!
I can pass!
" Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase. " They print any kind of shit in these papers.
Sir! Sir, I m sorry! He didn t mean it! He was trying to get me.
I know. I m sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we ll call it even.
This doesn t even have Burt Reynolds in it.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody s going to grab one.
So? So nobody s going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
I ve got a responsibility here. I can t let everybody grab free drinks.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
Why are the shutters closed?
Bunch of savages in this town.
He assured me that he d be here by twelve.
Shocking abuse of authority.
Don t screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
No, thanks.
Why?
You called Caitlin again?
Did you tell Veronica?
What do you two fight about?
I ll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
I m going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You ve been with Veronica for how long now?
Chick s nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
Eight and a half?
That s cheating?
She called you Brad?
That s not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl " Mom. "
What do you mean?
Oh, my God.
That girl was vile to you.
Your mother.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
That s frightening.
In light of this lurid tale, I don t see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
Oh yeah.
You think things would be any different now?
Oh shit, I ve got to place an order.
No, no, I m listening. She s leaving college, and...?
What about Veronica?
Caitlin s on the same wave length?
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
You know what I just watched?
Return of the Jedi.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Blasphemy.
All right, Vader s boss...
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
Well, he s like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He s a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
Now, he s in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
Then wouldn t that logically mean that it s a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
There s more?
Yeah.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it s due.
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
And you figured it out?
Basically.
And the second time around...?
So?
Not just Imperials, is what you re getting at.
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
Wait.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Each egg has to be perfect.
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
You know how much money the average jizz mopper make per hour?
He s the guy in those nudie booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
Nudie booth. You ve never been in a nudie booth?
What kind of show?
Can we talk about this later?
Who cares? That lady s an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn t for the fucking customers.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You d feel a hell of a lot better if you d rip into the occasional customer.
Liar! Tell me there aren t customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
How can you lie like that? Why don t you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
Let s hear it.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
Why not?
Jesus, you got a one track mind. It s always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
Can you believe this?!
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
FUCK!
What?
I know.
I don t back down.
You know what pisses me off the most?
I m going to miss the game.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It s not helping.
Sorry.
I can t believe I m going to miss the game!
I ve gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I ve ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
I don t know. You going to lock the video store?
We re not playing in the street.
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it s barely a warm up!
Exactly. They drank it all.
I still can t believe Caitlin s getting married.
Yeah, right.
Sanford s brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid backstroke.
Correct me if I m wrong, but wasn t she one of the illustrious twelve?
You ve had sex with a dead person.
No, you re not.
It s today.
Paulsen s Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
One night only. She s buried in the morning.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
I m not missing what s probably going to be the social event of the season.
But I love gatherings. Isn t it ironic?
If you go, I go.
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
I m going with you.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
Twenty two; same as us.
An embarrassing way to die.
How d he die?
That s embarrassing?
Bible truth.
I swear.
Come on. Haven t you ever tried to suck your own dick?
Yeah sure. You re so repressed.
No, because you won t admit to it. As if a guy s a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You re as curious as the rest of us, pal. You ve tried it.
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
Balls resting on his lips.
Reach what?
What, your dick?
Listen to you.
I m telling you, it wasn t my fault!
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
So they ll put her back in! It s not like it s gonna matter if she breaks something!
I don t want to talk to you.
Why should I loan you my car?
Let me borrow your car.
If you must.
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes these practices are standard operating procedure.
What?
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can t shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn t be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I m a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice. Agreed?
I like to think I m a master of my own destiny.
What d you rent? Best of Both Worlds?
And this is what you rented?
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
Five hundred dollars.
Living proof.
I don t; you did.
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
Because I m here.
I swear. I couldn t make this kind of hell up.
Because I m happy.
I m happy.
No. I m happy because Caitlin came to see me.
I m not. She just left.
She s not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
I m not.
She went home, she s getting ready, and we re going out.
Watch the store while I go home and change.
This is my way of spitting water at life.
No! Don t bring it up. I don t want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I ll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you ll have to close the store tonight.
Bunch of savages in this town. Hey, Caitlin s in the back. You might want to see if she s okay; she s been back there a long time.
I told her that. She said she didn t need any. Why don t you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam bam.
What time did we go to the funeral?
This life.
Why do I have this life?
I m stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I ve got an ex girlfriend who s catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty six dicks.
I should shit or get off the pot.
What are you talking about?
Fuck you.
What responsibility?
As if it s that easy.
Leave me alone.
Oh, like your life s any better?
Thank you. Why don t you go back to the video store?
Leave her out of this.
Leave me alone.
... If I wasn t such a fucking coward. It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
You re wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Caitlin and I can t be together. It s impossible.
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you re saying may be true. But that s the way things are; it s not going to change.
I can t, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can t make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would but I don t have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
Jesus H. Christ, I can t!
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
The swelling s not so bad. But the FDS stings. How s your neck?
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
Thanks.
Oh please! I m surprised I didn t kill you.
Why do I say that? Randal... forget it.
What don t you do? Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
What time did you get to work today?
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
Unless you re out renting videos at other video stores.
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What s your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank? You know what the real tragedy is? I m not even supposed to be here today!
You need a ride?
Same time. What about you?
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
Helluva day.
Do you need a hug or something? Cause I would have no hang ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don t knead my ass when you do it.
Yes.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
I m her sister.
Excuse me?
I didn t strain. I sighed.
I don t think so.
They are not.
What are you talking about? There s no fat on this body.
How much can you bench?
Yeah.
Yeah?
How do you know that?
No, she s getting married.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
Yeah, you cock smoking clerk.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
One seventy nine.
A half hour.
I should start.
With you? I don t think so.
How do you figure... HEY! You can t roll a joint in here!
It s not my store.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
You sell to people that can t stay away from an addiction.
A dollar sixty nine, plus tax.
So.
I can t believe you just rolled a joint in here.
He died in the bathroom.
I don t know. I wasn t watching.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
We were going to start again, I think.
Veronica.
Lasagne.
Maybe.
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
She s my girlfriend.
Meaning?
I m trying.
So I m told.
No, he got hit by a bus.
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
I understand, but can I use it. I m not that young anymore, so I m kind of... you know... incontinent.
Thanks son. Say what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
I m not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
Aw, c mon boy. What s the difference? You said yourself the stuff that s there now is rough.
Jesus... go ahead.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
Too hard?! I don t have enough indignities in my life people start throwing cigarettes at me!
I hate this fucking place.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
I m not even supposed to be here today!
The guy got sick and couldn t come in.
Yes! And I m going to play like shit because I didn t get a good night s sleep!
I m only here until twelve, then I m gone. The boss is coming in.
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
Bunch of savages in this town.
I don t know like two thirty, three.
Hunhh? Nothing.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
She called you, didn t she?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Why do you say that?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they re being watched.
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won t come off.
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Really?
Yeah, right. You can t get enough of me.
How do you figure?
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
A girl makes a guy cum, it s standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it s talent.
Something wrong?
I touched a nerve.
It wasn t directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
How many what?
How many different girls? Didn t we already have this discussion once?
Including you?
Twelve.
You re a pig.
Do you know how many different men I ve had sex with?
Three.
Three including you.
I m not the pig you are.
You!
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
I am. And that s why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You ll sleep with anything that says yes.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
To school. There s a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
It s important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you d go back to school.
Sylvan made it up. It s a blow job thing.
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It s called snowballing.
He gets off on it.
Why do you say that?
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
That s because I never had sex with him!
We went out a few times. We didn t have sex, but we fooled around.
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn t mean I didn t just go with people.
I m sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
Please calm down.
Dante...
Let it go...
All right! Shut up a second and I ll tell you! Jesus! I didn t freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Something like thirty six.
Lower your voice!
Um. Thirty seven.
I m going to class.
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I d slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
... And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which if you re too stupid to comprehend means that I ve been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead! But don t look at me like I m the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
Because going down it s a big deal! I used to like a guy, we d make out, and sooner or later I d go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
I love you. Don t feel sick.
Thirty seven. I just can t...
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It s lasagne.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
At least he wasn t thirty six.
And he said most of them are college guys, I ve never met or seen.
... it isn t there. Yes.
Thank you for the lasagne.
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
What time do you get finished?
Sure.
If you didn t want to go out with me anymore, why didn t you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
You ve been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I ve gone down on a couple guys!
I m not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I m going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
I don t want Caitlin...
I don t want to go back with her...
Randal...?
Veronica, I love you...
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
I ll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
Scumbag. What are you doing?
He s your cousin?
No way.
Does he sing in English or Russian?
I don t know. I can t really tell from here.
My ex boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two fifty, three hundred easy.
No way!
That s tight. Solid.
Yo, I don t have that kind of cash.
How long you gonna be here?
You re gonna be at John K s party?
Yo, don t sell all that. Cause I m gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K s. You re gonna bring it, right?
Yo. I ll see you at that party. I ll see you there?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part that s just my theory.
Don t hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It s not your fault. It s Dante. I don t know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
You re not?
He didn t ask me to...
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
That s cool. Well you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
Bye.
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
What?
That woulda been cool.
Hey, let s get something straight. If I m gonna die, I m gonna die, but you re always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
Fuck you.
I don t know.
I copy.
If you can t make it back, I ll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin. You sound like a mother hen.
So, what do you see?
What usually eats a banana?
So... what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
It can t fly in this weather.
Bags?
I want the money meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don t do it and we re going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
Hey, anything for a friend. How s the knee?
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin out of a hot tub.
Rescue One have located helpless climber, please prepare idiot line for transport, over.
No, stay off the line! You ll break her loose!
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
When we get this group down, I m gone.
I m here for the same reason you are, so let s do it.
Look, I know
I did what I thought was right.
There wasn t time for anything else.
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
Near Freedom Falls. She went for help.
Not on that leg.
Fine, I guess...
Just keep lookin at me and only think about the distance across. Count it as you go: One, two... by eight you ll be there.
Sure you can.
That s it, you look like a professional.
Nice and easy...
Help me! I don t want to die!
Patience my love, patience.
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say we know it well.
We spent a night there one night...
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
When you call me Gabriel, I know I ve got trouble.
Working... I m trying to figure out where to start.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
I don t think you do.
Did I? I don t know. Maybe I shouldn t have gone out on that line. Maybe I panicked.
I can t blame anything on Hal. It was me. I play it back in my mind everyday.
I don t expect you to understand.
You couldn t.
Why are you yelling?
Why are you yelling?
Y know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting
Okay, but if you do I ll have to perform resuscitation
Mouth to mouth, which could maybe...
Maybe lead to a flare up...
Flare up of old emotions...
From one professional to another, of course.
I can t. Not here. If you want, I d like you to come with me... somewhere else.
It doesn t matter, anywhere but here.
Like I said, I can t turn it off.
If it s alright, I m gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
He doesn t want my help.
He can handle it.
I haven t climbed in months you lose the feel.
What are you doing here!?
How d you get up here?
You got to go back now!
I can t. The radio s at the bottom of the shaft. But Frank ll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I ll contact everybody from the chopper.
For the same reason you did, to help.
What about you?
I m glad you find humor in this. Do you know what people would do for that?
Neither can I. What do you think they re doing now?
Call me sentimental.
Of course I do.
You attacked me.
Only kidding... actually I attacked you.
Yeah?
I ve gone this far, and right now I think I m in better shape than you.
Want me to lead?
What?
This rope is sixty years old!
Never
I ve never weighed 135 lbs.!
Don t let me fall!
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
Forget it. You re in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn t drop me, so I owe you. C mon, let s go. Hurry up, time is money.
That s exactly what I want you to do.
Hand holds?! I can barely see them.
Are you crazy? Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
I won t do it. No way.
Enough s enough. How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
I m going to wrap it around your throat!
Forget it! I refuse!
Gabe? Wait til I get over there. Tie the rope so I can come across.
There s a lot more where that came from. You re not leaving again?
Good memory. You must be great with numbers.
I burned it.
Never could save a thing.
No, he s gone.
Qualen, go fuck yourself. The game s over you lost.
Tucker and Walker.
Who s going with you?
Where s the rest of the team?
Who the hell ever is. This is the most protected shipment we ve got and the most useless. These bills aren t even in circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we re transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
Now I have jurisdiction! I said get your weapons.
Were. Give me the tracking monitor!
Ask the questions.
What about it?
I told you, 50, 000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
No, that son of a bitch Walker is alive.
I don t give a shit, Qualen! I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low life, piece of shit like you. They beat us. A couple of fuckin hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
Good morning, Walt.
Richard Travers.
We ve got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
I haven t lost a bill in eighteen years, don t jinx me, Walt.
We ve been working hard too. Takes glass.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim s legs.
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don t get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I ve been punished.
I ve been cured.
I just don t get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You re not on their side and can t be. You can t be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
I m frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
I... I m very sorry, but I never open. I m very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
What the bloody hell d you think you re doing?
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
No! No! Don t touch it. That s a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
How do you do, sir?
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
Well, as I ve said, we ve heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
But first we d like to find out a few things about you.
Well, shall we get down to it?
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I ll try to sleep it off... then I ll be as right as dodgers for this after.
I ve got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I m liable to miss a lot more school.
Alex.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid " playfully " grabs Alex s hair.
Just a manner of speech, sir.
Because next time it s going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you ve no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.
I ve been doing nothing I shouldn t, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We ve been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You ve got a good home here, good loving parents, you ve got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
That s just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You re about due now by my reckoning, that s why I m warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
New way? What s this about a new way? There s been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You re a big strong chelloveck like us all. We re not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
I did, sir.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I ve kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I ve come to see you personally to see how you re getting along.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We ve put you right, you re the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man a writer of subversive literature who has been howling for your blood. He s been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you re safe from him now, we ve put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
We always help our friends, don t we? It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you re fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Keeping fit then?
Well, how are you then?
Well I m back.
Aye.
Oh, aye, aye.
Aye, that s Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That s what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
No, brother. What d you want?
Sorry, brother. I didn t mean any offence.
Why did you do that, brother? I ve never done wrong to you.
... and this... He pulls Alex s nose.
... because I don t like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
You re gonna be sick are you?
You wanna be sick?
You wanna get up? Well, you ve gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp s stomach. The boys laugh.
Oh and what s so stinking about it?
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That s it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
You have, my son.
Indeed.
You certainly have not, 655321. You ve been very helpful, and you ve shown a genuine desire to reform.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don t be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
That s not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
And there s Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available s what Will the English says.
No I don t know, luv, I d taken my sleepers.
We ve only just read about it in the morning papers.
Four in this block, sir.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
What?
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
We taking bets? What if you re wrong?
No. I got lucky with the lights.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Violin. I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Different instrument altogether. You know, if you d only listened to me, we d be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Why d you do that? Don t tell me you re a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
No? How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
This? Temporary. To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
You psychic?
Bottega.
Big case?
Most of the time.
Like you, I m good at it. But at this exact moment in time... like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
Just had one.
When was the last time you took one?
How often you go?
Max...
Max? Oh...... it s kind of a strange time to be calling...
He s... what? Say again? We re in cell hell...
If this is a joke, it s not funny.
In my office?
Seventh, files section. What should I do?
Max, I m scared. Are you sure?
Comin over Coldwater. Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me. You believe that?
I was heading back to my garage. It s on the way.
I m... fine. Fine.
You re kidding me.
Jesus...
Was it great? Better than great, it had to be...
You heard Armstrong play live. I ve never been this jealous. You get to talk to him?
Oh, my, yes.
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played. So Pops, he just waves me right up. My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
Most vividly. " St. Louis Blues, " " Potato Head Blues, " " Sleepy Time Down South... "... then Pops laid some " Cornet Chop Suey " on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
Jazz question. What other kind is there? You get it right, we roll with it. You disappear. Tonight. You don t go home, you don t pack a bag, you just leave town... and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
It s simple. What was your pal Louis first musical instrument?
I m sorry.
Can t say that I do.
I think...... I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
Federal?
Tell me. Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Can you finish on schedule?
Twenty five?
Very generous.
So?
Ivan Petrov. Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up. I come here, find this.
Months now. He s been feeding me information on Dmitri.
Oh, we working for the Feds now? If my snitch flew out a window, he s got Dmitri s handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
What thing?
Oh, right. The guy flipped out or something? Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
So? It was a random thing.
Oh?
Elvis?
Jesus. Two in one night?
Not our call, Phil.
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Tell my son. You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
What s your name?
Try?
I ve been calling and calling.
You couldn t pick up a phone? I m lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
What am I gonna do with flowers?
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things? So I can watch them wilt?
What s he sayin?
Yo, whassup?
I ll fuck you up, you don t hand it over.
Let s not get excited, sir.
I was just tryin to... to...
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Who is this?
What are you guys, taking an all night tour?
Nothin! Aside from Max s mother driving me crazy, I m dancin on a rainbow! Get him on the line, please.
So? Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
... everything is not about me, don t make me the villain here. That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
... oh, bullshit! He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
Twenty four minutes.
Third, but I still can t tell uptown from downtown. Tell the truth, whenever I m here, I can t wait to leave. Place gets to me. Too loud, too fast... too much. You like it here?
You share it with over three million people every day. You know that s the population of New Zealand? What s Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That s a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles. Read about this one guy. Gets on the subway and dies. Six hours he s riding around before anybody notices. Think about that. Here s this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million. That s too damn many people.
Yeah. I share it with the dayshift guy.
People are more relaxed. Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
You mean like benefits?
It s not that kind of job.
Me, specifically?
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking. This job s a fill in.
Twelve years. But I m working on other stuff...
I don t talk about it, you know... No offense.
Yeah. Lucky with the lights.
I m not a hire car. It s against regs?
Two, two fifty.
Max.
You always stutter?
You re cool.
With what?
The trunk?
I don t think I can do this.
His hand moved! His goddamn hand twitched!
Yes! I m trying, I swear!
Two...
I tried it.
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
What?
It s a mess.
South Central.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
They re somebody s friends... You drive a cab. I kill people. We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
Tonight it is.
Yes.
I Ching? You threw a man out a window!
What d he do to you?
How can you kill him like that?
Who was he?
Rwanda Burundi. Central Africa.
You don t know the guy in the trunk, either. If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
How?
Then don t let me get cornered, Max. You don t have the trunk space.
Why?
I can t do that. He s the Man. He ll fire my ass.
I need the job.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you re gonna kick his fat ass.
What?
I don t understand...
Yes, Max?
I m... what? Sorry?
I listen to classical.
I never learned jazz.
That what we re doing? Flowing?
I m not catching a melody.
You mind? I m working here.
No.
Leave me alone.
I m collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
She s in the hospital.
What difference does it make?
Don t start.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Fuck! Nothing s ever goddamn good enough! It s always been that way.
Yeah? What happened?
What happened?
I m sorry.
It s not bullshit.
I ve always been good. Ever since I started. Gave up piano. Easy money. I m putting a stake together, get something started. Go figure it all out...
I told you I don t like to talk about it.
See, I ve got bills. My mother s been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
Doesn t cover everything.
Dmitri?
I don t get it.
Why me? Why don t you do it?
He s gonna shoot me?
No. No way. I can t do this.
I... I wasn t thinking. I just did it.
Why?
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term " assassin. "
No.
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner. Twelve minutes.
Who?
I don t know.
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
You had to kill Heller?!
That cop! Why d you have to do that? You couldn t wound him? The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
No, not just that.
Yeah, so, what s wrong with that?
Some living.
What s at Union Station?
One more.
Whyn t you kill me and find another cab.
You re full of shit.
That s what you said...
What d they do?
That s the reason?
Then what are you?
What happened to you?
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said: " You gotta tell me what s goin on with that person over there or I ll kill you "... they d have to kill you... Cause you don t have a clue for... or about... anyone... To be like that, I don t think you, you have any of that for your own life... Do you believe you re entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a. m.? Open your eyes in the morning? I don t think you do... I don t think so... I think you are way low... like in your estimation. In your estimation of yourself. So how d you get that way...?
Answer the question.
None of your business.
Slow down.
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger? Kill us? Go ahead, man! Shoot... my ass.
Who?
Any special reason?
Love? Love s just a pretty way of saying, I want to sleep with you. Love is bullshit.
Geronimo?
But you ll die. You ll squash yourself. What s the point?
Why the hell not?
The guy came right at us!
Drop me off here!
Water mains usually go in the winter. It s August 1st.
Mississippi?
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Come on! Six major earthquakes in the last three years? The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Do you still ride?
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn t quit?
Motive?
NASA is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
I can t promise you anything.
I think you re different.
Johnny Dancer. You ve been in my office ten times. How come you never asked me about that picture before?
You bit someone s nose off?
Put down the gun and I ll take your statement. Okay?
Switch the charts.
What is?
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night. Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
I got to get downstairs. The C. I. A., they want to see your body.
For what?
Arf... You gotta help me.
Don t tell me you re naked back there.
That s how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out. A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Oswald was an assassin. You re not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
Right. Sit up so I can see you.
Them who?
Yeah.
As opposed to?
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
That s how a man would do it. I m not a man.
Nothing is easy.
Six months. Eleven days.
What is it with you and the space program?
I m not sure. I think I figured something out. It must ve been in my newsletter.
You re certifiable.
Surprise me.
I ve been reading up on it.
' The Space Shuttle s Seismic Secret. The Oliver Stone George Bush Connection. Oliver Stone?
Can you prove any of this?
Pretty scary, huh?
Just five. It s the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
Who?
Never heard of him.
Uh huh.
Never, but I ve been practicing.
Jerry, there s something I have to ask you. Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question. To my satisfaction.
It was that painting. The one on the wall.
It made me feel like you could see inside of me. And I don t know how that s possible.
Is this your dad?
Is he dead?
How d he die?
Not this again.
What van?
Where d you get your subscribers?
Well, I ve been tracking them down all morning.
They re dead. Four out of five anyhow. All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
I ll be fine. Let s worry about Henry Finch. P. O. Box in St. Louis. He s the last on the list. I haven t been able to reach him yet.
Realized what?
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials. But they re all part of two warring factions. One: families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing. Stability. Group Two: the boat rockers. Eisenhower s military industrial complex. They want instability. It s a trillion dollar a year business. When there isn t a hot war, they make a cold one.
So now they feed us terrorists. To create fear. How much do you think an airport security system goes for? Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
Latest casualty? Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Right here in Manhattan.
Nobody dies in Newport. They couldn t even kill Sunny von Bulow there. Harriman drowned, but it wasn t in Newport.
What was he doing down here? A billionaire waiting for the subway? Why not drown him in a bus? Why drown him at all? Why not shoot him? Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis? I mean, come on.
They re big details, Jerry.
A water main broke.
Okay, I will.
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
I like you, Jerry. A lot.
Jerry, I
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca Cola again.
Holes? I don t know what you re talking about.
Now s not really the time to get into this
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don t think that.
No. That wouldn t be fair. Where are we going, Jerry?
Where are we going, Jerry?
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three. John Wilkes Booth. Mark David Chapman. Lee Harvey Oswald.
Did you kill him?
He gave it to me.
Where were you the day he died?
That s the last time you rode, isn t it? Do you think it was your fault? Is that why?
Yeah. I know what it s like.
Can t give you the details because I can t remember. I went to court to kill him. At the Ezekiel Walters hearing. I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference. You were there. That s the first time I saw you.
I don t know what it was. All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn t do it. If that s love, it s not so bad. I found a part of myself that day. I couldn t go back.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway. He showed me. I visited a few times. Then one of Jonas s guys visited. When I arrived, your dad was dying.
Walters was their fall guy. Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear. Don t you see? Your father wasn t trying to keep Walters in prison. He was looking into getting him out. He didn t believe the official story.
They ll trace it.
What about you?
It s up. Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
You think it s a conspiracy?
That s great. Good for you.
Liza!
You re welcome. Where s my partner?
I m not sure what you mean.
That s ironic. Because we re here to protect her from you.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions? Are they honorable?
I m leaning toward no.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day. She
I don t know...
Alright. You can see her. But she can t see you.
A dog bit it.
You were going to ask about my nose. The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
You already asked me that. Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
You ve asked me that one three times.
I m sorry. What was the question again?
Honestly? I think he has a crush on me.
Excuse me?
The truth shall make you free.
We re very specialized.
Fine. What the hell is going on?
It was mind control. Manchurian Candidate kind of stuff, right?
Ask what you can do for your country. That kind of thing.
As in Catcher in the Rye?
Terminal?
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I d arrest you right here.
Missionary? Penance? You talk about it like it was a religion.
And what did I say?
My dog. One I intend to put to sleep. Extrapolate from there.
Jerry is dangerous. Jerry has killed
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live. Why are you telling me all this?
You do recognize it then?
I know the story. A federal judge. He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
Walters had nothing to do with your father s murder.
Working.
Working.
Look, you re a nice guy, but I m not really dating right now.
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
This doesn t make sense.
I don t like it. Something s wrong.
We don t know who Jonas is. We don t know who it is we re cooperating with.
Tell me about it.
Wasn t my idea.
Yeah, I do.
And Jonas?
He s shown himself. Why haven t you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
Where do you think Jerry is?
I m going to find him. Because he d find me.
What do you suggest?
I m not sure. We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
Pull the plug. Get her out of there.
What?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Glad to have you, David. How s the new office?
Tell me.
So?
I m willing to take that risk.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity. There are over four hundred billion stars out there
You re
What if you re wrong? No I ll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence you can t deny the possibility and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation and worth taking a few risks.
Oh? How s he doing?
Really? Congratulations, by the way.
' President s Science Advisor so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
No doubt.
Did I tell you we ve expanded the search spectrum? We re including several other possible magic frequencies not just the hydrogen line anymore. I was trying to get inside their heads, y know? And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious transcendantals, right? So we ve been trying variations of pi...
It s not enough having my search time systematically cut down you know I m down to three hours a week now.
You can t just pull the plug, David.
Meaning...
I m searching for patterns in the noise, that s all. Order in the chaos. I m practicing listening
The difference being what that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don t care about the results of my work? Well, I do care. Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I m some kind of dispassionate automaton when it s obvious to anyone with a brain I m just not.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David
David
If it s attention you want I d say you ve got it. Just one thing: Why Vega? Everyone s looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
What? Why?
With me.
I m going to convert Mr. Science is the root of all evil? This is absurd, David. We have work to do here, I don t have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
Are you threatening me?
We ve cracked it. Lunacharsky found it.
Ellie.
Actually I m running late
I don t understand.
Ellie... you should know that I m no longer the President s Science Advisor.
This... seemed best.
What would you have me say, David?
Thank you?
Been there, done that, got the T shirt.
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes. You must be Eleanor.
1919  21. Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
This is how you see the sky?
It s beautiful.
This isn t a person to person call, Mr. Kitz. I don t really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
And a hundred mile airspace.
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then
Is that your official response?
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you re talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
Is it possible. Yes. But
I can t move any smaller.
But what do I say?
On that old shortwave? Maybe on a clear night. Come on now, under the covers.
Big enough radio, I don t see why not.
Mmm, that s a good one. Maybe his echo... Okay, no more stalling.
I m sorry I couldn t be there for you, sweetheart.
That s my scientist.
Am I artifact or dream? You might ask that about anything.
Originally just another species like yourselves. Well, not like you at all actually, but...
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
You contacted us. We were simply listening. We ve been listening for millions of years.
Many others.
Oh, we didn t build it. The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we re just its... caretakers.
We don t know. Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
Not all. Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams. Some never make it this far.
You always have been. We re all descendants of the same stars, Ellie. All made of the same primordial atoms.
Now... you go home.
If we don t engineer a consistent causality it ll work itself out on its own, and that s almost always worse. Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible. A lot of it you re simply not capable of understanding, not yet. No offense.
But other people from our planet should see what I ve seen they should witness this for themselves.
But you said you wanted to help don t you see what it would mean?
Please if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have it could make the difference
No. Please.
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile. Anyway, I ve had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer after outliving three wives and two children... I find I ve had quite enough of planet Earth.
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness. You re here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium. Perhaps you ve noticed. Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
Oh, maybe not out but definitely looking for you coat. I understand you ve had some difficulty locating the what are you calling it? The primer that will make decryption possible... I ve found it.
I ve had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway. There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who ve given from whom I ve taken so much.
A page break signal. A period.
You re saying... there is no separate primer in the message because it s on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is
Very good, Doctor. I ve also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex all of which would seem to indicate instructions an enormously complicated set of instructions for building something.
That would seem to be the question of the hour. I want to build it, Doctor. Of course I m already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
It s so... small.
Yes. A shame. Still... it d be worse if they died for nothing.
Oh, not quite yet. At least for their sake...... I hope it s not. Because they re running out of time.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they re worried about us.
The systems integration site.
It s beautiful but it does get a little lonely. Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn t to avoid excess radio traffic but because we re all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which: How re you getting on with the old man?
Peter Valerian.
Keep it down, okay? Drumlin thinks I m enough of a flake as it is. Look everyone here has their little fetishes. Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon s got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
They can t. I think it s against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
' Any sufficiently advanced technology... '
Any luck on the grant money?
And?
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
Thirty one linked dishes. You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
Actually
I m moving to Washington.
I m going on staff at the N. S. F. To work for Drumlin.
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people s research to have the power to be a real advocate where David s got blind spots
' The work, Jesus, Ellie, can t there just once be more to life than the work? Okay, maybe that s the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes
Maybe that s the problem. I want... a family, Ellie. I want kids. A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid. A real life. Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don t care anymore. It s what I want.
Jesus
Ellie
Ellie I m getting married. Her name s Laura. She came up to Owens Valley to do her post doc about six months after you left.
It s really happening.
Like it or not.
I m I m fine.
Wait hold on a minute
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction? What day is this?
That s one way of putting it. Kitz, the President, the I. S. C. have shut down all official communications; there ve also been reports of riots flaring up across the U. S. and Europe. Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you
And where exactly does that put your position...?
I d say logic more than faith. The odds were on my side.
I guess I would ve felt sorry for the universe.
What about you? Doesn t all of this shake your faith at all?
Well it s been a while, but I don t recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
And mind, yes. What are you
Only a tiny bit. Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
Can you try?
And there s no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
You may not believe this... but there s a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God. To believe that we re all here for a purpose, that all this... means something. But it s because that part of me wants it so badly that I m so stubborn about making sure it isn t just self delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real. Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
I never knew my mother. My father died when I was nine.
Yes. Very much.
Some of my best friends are scientists.
Some of my best friends are scientists. They re saying the machine is alive.
Maybe you re creating a monster.
Why?
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
If you came back.
Something like that.
You re willing to die for this.
Really.
What d you think?
I won t deny I was ambitious. When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible. I m the first to admit that process included making some compromises. You didn t answer my question.
I don t consider you the enemy, Ellie. I m not out to get technology. I only ask the question: Does it have to have all the answers? I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it s something they just don t seem to be getting from science.
I don t follow.
I don t know. But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
It s getting late...
An excellent question, Doctor. But what if we don t like the answer?
The final countdown.
I do seem to be... Maybe because I m just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
I m sorry.
I m sorry I can t
I can t do this
Please, Palmer if you care for me at all, don t push this now
Please
Don t you understand? I just have to hold it together just until tomorrow
I don t know
I can t hear this now
Hi.
It was quite a page turner.
I m not sure it s come to that.
I do.
It also makes God enormous. I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away. As it will everyone else s.
Ellie, you re the proof. You tell them your story. Ultimately they ll have no choice but to believe you.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you! The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
Have you seen what s happening out there? The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie. People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
Maybe what you experienced can t be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it s just like you said: ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
Does that mean you think it doesn t exist?
Meaning...
Git your shovel and git to work.
Git movin, I said.
I ll make it a dollar.
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don t recognize her pups no more, so she don t have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don t give a damn. They let you smoke?
No it hain t, Luke. You ain t alone. Ever whar you go, I m with you, and so s John.
What are you doin here?
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn t much for stickin around, but damn it he made me laugh.
Here, Mom.
Nothin. Ever thing s cool s can be.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Yeah.
That s good: he earned it.
Gotta go, Arletta.
I don t know, Boss.
Git to work!
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
She s on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
Maliciously destroyin municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Well, we ain t never had one of them. Where d you think that was gonna get you?
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
Hey, Tattoo!
Borrowin.
Pair a nines.
He s been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
What happened? How far did you get?
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin fishy l il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a friskin round with mah boy?
I didn t say nothin, Boss.
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
That sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Nuthin can be a pretty cool hand.
Fifty s a nice round number.
We got it locked in the sock.
You ol sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn t have nothin to worry about.
Like an elephant.
Foolin, Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
We ain t goin nowhere.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
Take it easy, Drag.
On my own.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They re out there thicker n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don t have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin to kill you, Luke. But I got em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn t even whip you this time.
Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn t talk to them about that. But why not? They re reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Ace calls. Here we go. King five gets a tray for no help. Paira ninas gets a Jack. Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
Well, how far didya get?
What did I do?
Fear of what...
Are you kidding? You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which rots... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for. Forget it.
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Oh my God! Help! HE S READING A NEWSPAPER!
No, dear. You re at your best with a bag in front of your face.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive. That men used to want me...
I m the only friend you ve got, darling, and I don t intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
Oh, God, I forget. Yes. Yes. You go. Poor thing, you ought to get out.
Tell her about what?
Without question? He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria? Couldn t another expert say he flunked the sexual sadist test? What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
Only part. What else? What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
' Lying. He was lying. I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
You said, first, he was lying. How do you know that, Doctor?
What pattern was that?
What first two murders. We don t know about them here, do we?
When was that?
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Inspector Halloran. Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
Cut the crap. You got a sheet the length of my arm...
Shut up I m talking. You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
You get me out first.
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum. I want Kurten s phone number.
You already made the delivery?
What Friday?
I brought a present for the lady, there. I m looking for her, to give her the present...
The door was open, swear to God, I m just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
He told you she was loaded, any thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad? You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
We know... Send the book to evidence...
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago. You read it yet.
Bet you never figured I d follow in your footsteps. It s real well written. You should read it you re in it.
Kurten! Is he bothering you? I told that son I d send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
Something personal. Is he bothering you?
Listen, you want my advice? Steer clear. He s writing me he s gonna finish my unfinished symphony. He s gonna give me  550 for some of my cum, he says he s in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk. I m offended. Right away I smell freak. Writin about him and me and you bein joined and he s gonna finish my symphony? I didn t care for his drift. I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways. You hear I found Jesus? And what s funny is, now I don t mind bein inside. If I was out, even Born Again, I d probably get restless again. It s maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
You come and visit.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Who was the man in the basement?
Where are you, Peter?
It s Daryll Lee Cullum, isn t it?
You know I can t do that.
I need her; she s a cop. I have to kill a cop, and then...
You know where.
No. Not yet.
I have no life anymore. I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
That s not who I admire I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
Do anything you want to me. I give myself to you. Only put the knife down. Isn t this what you always wanted? I know it s what we all want, to love and to loved. I could love you. You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
You re calling me a crank?
I think this is number three...
Is he out?
If he s not out, why are they here?
You don t admire me. No police admire me. I got one of you killed. Why don t you say right out what you re here for?
Well, let s thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Oh, my God, no! I m a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I m afraid of everything, real and imaginary. I never leave this apartment now. Nobody ever comes here. I just wanted to get your attention. I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I m not competent.
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don t like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don t give a fuck. That s the upside of having a breakdown.
Will you go. Andy, make them go.
For months... last October.
How do you know that?
Nothing.
How did you know they were stockings?
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don t envy you this; he s not done he s going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush. Now, I ve done what you asked me.
One officer already got killed trying to protect me. Please, just take it all away. Leave me alone.
I don t look at pictures. I look at the real thing. I don t feel infected.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in your computer?
He s going home. He slept over because I was a little anxious...
That s no surprise.
Then what do you need me for?
I turned it off. It s like an open window he can climb right in...
Have you got a warrant? Get the hell out o here! This is the only space I have left in the world! Why can t you leave me out of it?
That little Winona Ryder manner... you re more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
Hello, Ruben... So that s that...
Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That s a product for cleaning with...
It s what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Ah, if you knew that, you d be half way to nailing him. Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive. This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex. He s playing a game with us. Who will he imitate next? Maybe he s doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers hall of fame. Just to prove he s better than all of them. They got caught; he didn t.
Who s going to catch him? You? And if you do, there ll be another one. And one after that.
This one, yes. I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I ve felt personally terrified of. He s something new and unheard of. I don t know what he wants.
You betrayed me! Now every psychopath in the city knows I m back in business... You lied to me!
Why should I trust you?
One of those goddamned car alarms. What s going...
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
It s also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan. You can t run away from it anymore. Look at the order he s doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work. Then he did one like the Hillside Strang ler. And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on to where and what end? And he s doing more than that he s imitating each killer s method as closely as he can in details. Injecting Windex. Using. 44. Playing Abba.
They re not talking to me. Saks looks right through me. I ask him for some bodies, for the phones he s so encouraging: " you make that your little job. " Condescending bastard. Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin. Daryll Lee Cullum?
He felt sorry for me. It was so nice to flirt. He was a darling man.
You re exhausted. Let me get you a brandy.
Bundy. That s the last one in your speech...
I m working on it! It s what I do. Quinn... Halloran. I ll wait. Where s Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
W We had a fight. I called him... called him a name...
They never kill themselves. How do you know it was him. You never met him. You never even saw a photograph...
He hasn t done Bundy. He s done every one of the others, hasn t he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel? Go there. See if there could be any way for him to escape.
If there s a one percent possibil ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
He s hacked into her Internet address. He s a hacker.
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran. It just did that...
MaryJane. We call her M. J.
I ll get a locksmith.
Yes. I have to go...
What?...
Is there a phone booth there?
They taught me at the FBI. I was very good at it. It scared me... I liked it.
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
He s got Sergeant Halloran in there. He ll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she s well paid for. Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
I m over here? What s your name, Officer?
You touch anything, Mike? Pick up anything? Use the doorknob? I don t want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
Well, there s something missing in there. There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it s gone now.
Because it s your job, that s all.
You got that right, Nikko, it s none of your business.
Yeah. And you used that. Used me
Yeah, you did that too. You earned what you got; don t shit on it, that s all I m saying.
Christ. I didn t lock the fucking drawer! You spend twenty years thinking some perp s gonna whack you... you ll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself... You can t imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead. Every time... Want to hear something weird? I feel like I d give my life to bring him back.
Just horseshit luck.
Classy madonna.
You came in there with this attitude...
He s just mad he let me keep the espresso machine. We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Honest to God, Ruben!
What about her arms?
Look at her legs.
You re right. I can t stand that bastard. Sorry. This is something new. Not the same guy, that s for sure.
Excuse me? Excuse me?! What do you...
It s against your rules that I try to help a witness who s scared shitless? Who s...
Don t try to lie, Ruben. You don t have the face for it. I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson s place...
Am I in charge of this thing? Or not.
Right.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
What clues? I m going to work Helen Hudson.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case? She s the expert. I need help.
Yessir.
Who ve I got to beat up except the messenger? Does this give us anything to go on?
I know. Get out here.
What? I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk. I can t believe this guy. Saks. He s a Deputy Assistant Director of the F. B. I. " Let me help you! "
It s not the same guy. It should be a self solver. No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different. The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed or bathroom. This one didn t have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head. Sexually assaulted. The others weren t molested that way. We re waiting for the sperm tests...
You re damn right I do.
Helen Hudson...
What does this mean? Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I m working my ass off, is anybody listening? Why Ruben, anyway? He and Nikko don t even get on together...
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don t waste time being diplomatic.
You got a suspect...
I m gonna drop charges on the break and enter at Hudson s...
Or the F. B. I.?
Give me Ruben back...
... confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern? Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
She left you, Nikko. She s not your responsibility. She takes very good care of herself. If she wants to romance the kid, it ain t your business. Your business is to snap out of it.
Don t give me six years! You never divorced Patty, did you? So what d you expect from M. J.?
Then you shoulda known she wasn t buying. She was just long term leasing you. Ah, Nickie. Except for that rare twenty second twitch, there ain t nothin about sex I don t hate. But of course, I m Irish. Plus I got real problems. I m worried I might have to put you in over M. J. There s something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can t leave a woman in that position. But the thing is, how can I move you in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
Why don t we save it for later? It s almost time for Letterman.
Yes, I fed her. If she says she s hungry, she s lying to you. Again.
She lies all the time. Why would I say I fed her if I didn t?
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
And her husband? What was he?
Outside in the visitors, car park.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn t believe you d gotten out alive.
It is?
You should have gone to the funeral.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
I can t sit on this balcony forever. I m beginning to feel like a potted plant.
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
You re not envious?
It does.
He s very pale. Covered with scars.
No. But when he s in that car...
I think it s badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
At home. I couldn t face all this traffic.
One of your suitors?
I d like to go back. James...
It s not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital. I don t want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
Not yet though not soon enough for some people, I ve already found. A death in the doctor s family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
I ll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
Look at all this traffic. I m not sure I can deal with it.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off ramp. I don t think we moved more than fifty yards. I m thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I ve got to think about now. There s a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I m beginning to feel. Well, it s a new approach for me, in any case.
Yes.
That s Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
Yes. I didn t plan it that way.
No.
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There s a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
Serious. But you ll have to take your new friend, the female crash test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
Hard to say.
You could get your wish at any moment.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy s assassination as a special kind of car crash?
It s the future, Ballard, and you re already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
I did this already.
Well, I don t have hallucinations. Honest.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you ve experienced.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you re dealing with.
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they re on their own because the side effects are so harsh. And, Michael s condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He s been in and out of...
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
Then, you should call.
I think it s about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
OK, good. That s good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
I have a going away gesture for you, too.
I ll talk to her, and to Dad, too. A few wisely chosen guilt tactics and they ll be ours.
Please, Letty.
And the party?
What about the engagement party?
You look beautiful.
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
Sage, rosemary... Les Herbes.
Loaned you. And it s only til you get out of here.
I can hardly wait til you re free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
Ecru.
You don t have to make any decisions tonight.
Do you want to go see him? I ll take you if you want to go.
Letty.
I answered these questions last night.
No.
By color.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that s ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
I wasn t hungry.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Very romantic setting.
Enough with the abracadabra.
Good God.
I won t do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
Don t be ridiculous.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Really? Me too.
Wow. I m bad news.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
I m starting to think that everyone s crazy to some extent.
I just want to see Beast. Where would you go?
No way.
I d like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we d get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
How can you even mention Spaghetti O s after eating Grandma Rosa s dinner tonight?
Tell the doctor.
Your family just met me.
Do you?
Michael, I...
Oh, right. I m ready. How do I look?
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
Not a one.
I saw Paul leaving. Did you do the dirty deed?
So, it s over?
No, I need some serious household advice.
I better make a list.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they re the latest thing.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
Do you like it?
I like it. But Headlines are better.
Yeah?
Sounds grim.
It doesn t matter. It ll work out.
Promise. As long as we have steak.
You got wine. That s great.
You go ahead and relax. I ll cook.
Are you OK?
The restaurant, too?
No, that s Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
Always the drugs.
I saw you talking to my Mom.
Why d you tell?
Michael, take it easy.
I guess so.
And all the plans we have.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
Well then why d it happen?
I didn t mean for any of this to happen.
What do you want to do?
Just promise me you ll be OK, OK?
It s not another one. It s my sister. Aren t you happy for her?
In there s better. It s kind of romantic, don t you think?
Oh, ok. Maybe.
I don t feel like going to work today.
Paul, I just can t go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
I m sorry. I m just... I m so tired lately.
You can get out of the dinner.
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Can you loan me a 20?
I m going to the store.
Yeah, I guess it s all right.
That s a big question.
I think we need to talk about some things.
Especially this last year.
I know. We can t just keep going through the motions.
You don t have to say anything else. I ve known for a while that this was coming.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
No, no.
No...
I don t mean to hurt you. I know this is a terrible thing. And I have really loved you.
I ve met someone else.
It doesn t matter who.
No.
I love him.
Here s the ring.
I m just glad there aren t any hard feelings.
Oh.
I heard about your friend.
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
I think I ve heard this speech before.
It s Elvis...
It s me...
You re there now?
You re calling me on your cell phone, right?
You re calling me on is phone?
My number s going to show up on his bill!
Oui.
Uh, yeah.
C mon, Laurant, America?
What?
You don t trust me?
It s Daniel.
I ve got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o clock.
Don t bullshit me, Laurant! I know about the Van Gogh.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
And nothing. He s just feeling us out.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we ll cut em off.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Nah, that s just Tony s way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
He missed three weeks.
I did. Joey " Two Tons " and Nicky " The Rake " did the deed.
Yes.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there s a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They re the only ones I have of her.
I guess we re going to find out.
I don t think it will be a mystery much longer.
I assume you want something?
Half the tapes.
I ll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don t honor my word.
Thank you.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
We can t.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
You want Zero to kill him?
You didn t buy batteries?
I can t believe you didn t check.
What for?
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
No.
Do I?
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
Good idea.
You didn t think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He s never going to stop looking for us.
What d you get?
Can I trust you, Sami?
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
You haven t answered my question.
I m leaving you with my friends. I m trusting you to do the right thing today.
What do you want now?
Man, I can get anything.
I ain t bullshittin. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain t gonna help your sorry ass. You ain t been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
I can see that. The man s car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He s head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito s got the word out he s looking for some French dudes. You re French ain t ya?
Yeah, I d be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin for you.
How much?
It s me.
Did you set it up?
We had a deal.
What?
Hey, idiot I ve got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
Hector, don t interrupt me.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
I m telling you I ve pulled out everything in the safe. There aren t any jewels.
I was told to take what we have and go.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
And he gave it to us. 145 Ridgeway Road.
What is it you do, Sami?
I see. A master criminal.
What kind of restaurant doesn t serve wine?
Hey, it s not your picture on the TV, it s mine. So, try to be cool.
We ve got to get out of here.
I m the driver.
I m not going to leave you.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don t remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
What the hell is he talking about?
Yeah, I can see that.
Me?
It s my idea.
Mr. Taylor?
God, I want to go home.
The baseball is mine.
No.
Yeah. It s mine.
The hell it is.
And I m tellin you it ain t! Now, turn your taco eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
Uh huh.
I don t know what you re talking about.
How?
It s yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
No problem, man. Hey, you wanna hit?
Yeah, I dig him.
I m more of a whiskey drinker myself.
Glenmorangie.
And you don t speak French?
What does arresting us get them?
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
Just lucky I guess. How d you start working for the Bastaldi s?
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
Something like that.
Something like that.
You ask a lot of questions.
I don t remember. I was drunk.
No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
It s okay. It was a long time ago.
No.
I thought I d listen to some of the tapes. See what s so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
She doesn t know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I m doin?
Yeah. I m going home today. What do you want, Frankie?
A little?
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
A car.
It s for you.
I don t know. Sell it. It s gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C mon Frankie, I m trying to make good here.
How s the arm? Still sore?
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
I didn t have the heart.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
This Jade Fox is a woman?
Then leave her to me.
Like most things, I am nothing. It s the same for this sword. All of it is simply a state of mind.
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
Why should I? You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
I ve always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan s secrets.
Why are you still here? You killed a policeman. You should leave! You ll bring ruin on my whole family.
I ll never live as a thief!
That was just for fun. How can I leave? Where would I go?
Shut up!
I owe you nothing.
I studied the diagrams. But you hid the details!
If I hadn t seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I d still be ignorant of all you ve hidden from me.
I ve made you silk pajamas. Do you want to change into them?
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
Go to bed then. Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon. God knows what the future will bring.
The handle is heavy. And the blade is no ordinary metal. Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You re just not used to handling it.
Beautiful but dangerous. Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire. It s 400 years old.
My friend Li Mu Bai. He s given it to Sir Te as a gift.
You re too young to understand.
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn t survive for long.
Writers wouldn t sell many books if they told how it really is.
Sure. No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
So I heard. Congratulations. It s the most important step in a woman s life, isn t it?
What do you think?
How so?
Thank you for seeing me. I hear your wedding day is near. You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
Do you think so? Let me tell you a story.
Yes. Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
His name was Meng Si Zhao. He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai s enemy. After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together. Our feelings for each other grew stronger. But how could we dishonor Meng s memory? So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it. But I have never tasted it.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman s duties.
I m just borrowing some clean clothes. I m not staying.
Look at the trouble you ve caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like. If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice. You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
Go back to them first. Then you can decide about Lo.
He really loves you. Come back to Peking with me. We ll find a solution.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
How dare you accuse us? I always knew you had stolen the sword! I ve done nothing but protect you and your family. And you re repaid me with nothing but contempt. Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him. We wanted some peace and you ve ruined it all! You re no sister of mine!
Come and get it if you can.
Not another lecture! On guard!
What I ve always wanted, to teach you.
Kneel!
Give it back!
You coward!
It s mine. It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn t understand.
By the way, I m a real Manchurian.
Give me back my comb.
So you re still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
Let them look.
I will.
Jen...
" A faithful heart makes wishes come true. "
It has. How s business?
Yes.
I left the training early.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared. I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
No. I didn t feel the bliss of enlightenment. Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow. I couldn t bear it. I broke off my meditation. I couldn t go on. There was something... pulling me back.
Something I can t let go of. You are leaving soon?
I am. He has always been our greatest protector.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
It s time for me to leave it behind.
First I must visit my master s grave. It s been many years since Jade Fox murdered him. I have yet to avenge his death. And yet I m thinking of quitting. I must pray for his forgiveness.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
You always suspected she d fled to the West.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
Be careful. Sir Te requires discretion. Official business is difficult enough. Don t let personal feelings make it worse. And I don t know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu s. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu s. Were you involved?
Have you questioned him yet?
But your men are watching over Yu s compund?
That s not what I meant. I don t care about the sword.
I don t know it was stolen until I got here.
But it s not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone. I wasn t about to ruin her life, or her father s.
I knew she would intrigue you.
She s an aristocrat s daughter. She s not one of us. In any case, it will all be over soon. You ll kill Fox, and she ll marry.
But Wudan does not accept women.
It s not our affair. Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
Not everything is an illusion. My hand... wasn t that real?
To repress one s feelings only makes them stronger.
What about you?
Jade Fox drugged her. How did you get here?
Shu Lien...
My life is departing. I ve only one breath left.
I m sorry she s not feeling well enough to receive you today.
That s good. Sometimes the help can t keep their hands to themselves. It s very embarassing.
But don t be too lenient.
A murderer?
What does it say?
Sir Te! It has brought him as much trouble as glory. Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he ll never be able to start anew.
Please do not be such a stranger. You ll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying. Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he s trying to tell you something?
Don t be coy. I ve always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it s a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You re both wasting precious time.
Yes, though I doubt he s involved in this.
This is a delicate matter.
What do you have in mind?
You know, you sure got a hard on for a guy that s guilty of zip on paper. Top Dollar runs Showtime; what s the matter, don t you like adult entertainment?
Don t any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
Care for a hot dog?
No onions?
Don t thank me.
You don t say.
Fucking A, my friend.
I need you to tell me what you remember. What happened to us?
I m sorry as hell, man.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
It s only a flesh wound.
How bout the morgue?
This isn t your place. This isn t your fight. And I don t need your help.
Leave here. Don t do this. I don t want you here.
I told you you re not supposed to come in here.
He was a present. Besides, we re moving anyway. You said.
Fun look at that guy...
Fun, he s not going away; he s scaring the piss outta me!
Who?
Mister Funboy lives there?
Can you play " Teddy Bears Picnic? " It used to be her favorite.
No.
She s dead. She s gone. And now you re just gonna go away and never come back, too. I hate this place; it isn t fair.
In a better place. I hope.
I went to see a friend of mine.
Mom tried to cook.
I don t know you.
I m looking for a good guitar man.
Last Halloween, eh? Yeah... Yeah, I remember. I fucked her too, I think.
I ain t got no fuckin ring.
Another jolly nickname?
T Bird?
I can see her.
I want the girl. Unharmed. Now.
You re too late. There was a guy outside on the stairs you really need to talk to. But he turned to dust and blew away. I don t have any power for you to take.
Does it hurt?
18k. Crap.
Nineteen bucks at Sears. Fake,
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is. I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
No shooting.
I don t think so.
You might say that.
That s right.
I ll be fine.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can t go on I... turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but
Excuse me?
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn t believe a word he
You what?
You didn t show it to anybody?
You can t do this to me. It could ruin me.
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He s got a bad rep, but it s mostly bullshit.
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he s loaded.
From who?
Forever.
On my mother s life.
Junior.
No.
I don t know. Relationships seem too distracting. I d rather concentrate on my studies.
You did?
That s a first. Most people praised me for it.
I wasn t knocking anything. It s just my belief that people shouldn t actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
Take yourself. You ve slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
A friend wrote me.
It s not really important.
Why are you being so dramatic?
You talking to me?
What cha reading?
Great book.
Several times. I m not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
That s a matter of opinion.
Why don t you come join me for a swim and we ll discuss it.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
Please.
What? Another letter from your friend?
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who s badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it s not some girl who s pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
About what you said today in the stable. I m not a happy person.
You implied it.
No, it s okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Seriously, you re amazing. You have everything going for you. You re smart, you re beautiful, you re determined. You re everything I want in a girlfriend.
I wasn t kidding. I d like to take you out.
Why not?
I don t... I don t want to answer that... look we re friends.
No thank you.
Give it up.
I m not going to speak to you till you realize that you can t intimidate me.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
I m trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
Well try this one on for size. I think I m falling in love with you.
Don t you believe in love at first sight?
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
Who?
How about tonight?
Doing what?
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I ll do anything. I can t get you out of my mind.
Yes.
Without question.
What?
Well, I was just calling to see how you re doing.
How was your date?
Wait, don t hang up.
What are you doing?
Of Human Bondage.
Yeah, it s pretty relevant considering my situation.
I m doing some volunteer work.
You? Volunteer? I don t think so.
Okay.
Oh please.
" I actually feel good about myself? "
You must take me for a real idiot.
You re going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
Yes it does.
I can t win with you.
I do not.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
No.
Who s Monsieur Philipe?
Why are you doing this?
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
I have feelings for you.
That s not fair.
Yes.
Where are you going?
I think that s for the best.
Sebastian, please. I don t want us to end on bad terms.
What are you saying?
I love you.
You don t even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She s smarter, prettier... you don t even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
None taken
Any ideas who it could be?
Where did you say she s from?
Greg McConnell.
He s from Kansas City. I wouldn t be surprised if he was your rat.
I don t think that bothered him.
Let s just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We d go at it for a while, then as soon as he d cum, he starts freaking out. You know " What are you doing, man? I m not a fag. I ll kick your ass if you say anything. " It s like, for Christsakes Greg, you re gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he s got a mouth like a Hoover.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He s already called me to hook up.
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
Don t think it s not going to cost you.
It s based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
I ll see you tomorrow.
He s alright. He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
What a loser she must be. Anyhow, Court s invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
You think so? I don t know. I guess I m just scared.
Ah duh. Boys. I ve never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Eww. No. That s gross.
Do you want to learn or not?
It was nothing.
Okay.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
Oh come on Cecile. He s crazy about you.
No.
I don t know.
Okay.
Yes. They re in this antique doll house in my room.
Why?
You d do that for me?
Something awful happened last night.
I... I don t think you want to know.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
If she knew, she d kill me. It happened at your house last night.
I don t know.
Well... not exactly.
No.
Cecile, I think you re going to have a hard time crying rape if that s all he did.
Well did you like it?
I did?
I don t love him. I love Ronald.
But that would make me a slut. Wouldn t it?
That s one way of looking at it.
I m what you would call a fifth year senior.
You think he ll like it?
Just taking your photo.
I want to go home.
My mom? Don t call my mom.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
You promised to let me kiss you.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we ve done.
Is it me?
I m taking a shower.
No.
Good night Cecile.
Please don t tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Come on Greg. You re the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
You told her I never said I love you before?
You told her that people are jealous cause I m loaded?
And you think she bought it?
Pretty sure or sure sure?
Who is this?
No.
I don t know. Why don t you leave her alone.
I told you I don t know.
Alright. She s staying with some friends of her parents. The O Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
Ronald?
It s Sebastian. He s out of his mind.
I think he s high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I m afraid to be alone. Please come over.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
Racist piece of shit.
He doesn t scare me. I ll kick his ass in.
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
So that s what this is all about. We ll get together and plan your curriculum.
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
I see your point... though why should I care?
Sounds intriguing.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It s too easy. " But I thought high school was only four years. " I mean, please. She knows nothing. She s seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Oh yes. I ve read it over and over again. This baby s the real deal. Daddy s little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
It just so happens we re not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel s father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She s staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster s virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
Care to make a wager on that?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
Be more specific.
What makes you think I d go for that bet? That s a seventy thousand dollar car.
Even there?
I m working on it.
Blow me.
You ready for this? I ve recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
Ooo, I m sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
What s your plan of attack?
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Yippy.
Yeah.
What s your problem?
She s really getting to you, isn t she?
And that s why you re losing your bet?
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Morning.
With who?
She shot you down.
So what went wrong?
You re telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn t. God are you a chump.
Where is she?
Where d she go?
Kind of.
Oh yes.
It was... Fantastic.
I know. That s the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn t like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I m going to sound like a Hallmark card.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Excuse me?
And that s why you re leaving?
I want to fuck.
No, I m not.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I ve always loved you.
I can t believe you re reacting this way. You re just saying this because you lost the bet.
I ve never done this before.
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
I have a flair for drama.
You wanted an answer to your question.
I d love to, but unfortunately I m expecting some company.
Come again?
Will you calm down?
I accept. Now get out.
Didn t you hear what I said?
Get out!
And if I don t?
I think you have your answer.
You re a lucky guy.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
What are you talking about?
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Ronald, you don t know what you re talking about.
I wasn t saying anything. I was singing.
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Yes, darling.
Oh, lots of times.
Sometimes.
That s what I wished on. Edward says it s a wishing ring and it is!
On the back street  a green house
Do you know the people?
Are they nice?
I got my wish anyway.
But it s already come true.
It was right there on top. Isn t she pretty?
What s her name?
Irena.
Wouldn t it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren s on his way to town tomorrow morning?
I wonder if you don t resent that in her?
I m not a jealous woman, Oliver.
That s why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena blame yourself for her death. And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
I know, dear. I understand. But try to worry a little less about her be a little easier in your thinking. And especially today  let s forget about it. We want a really bang up birthday party, don t we?
It s early yet.
Yes, darling,
No kids yet. Something s gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
I think I should. 3000W?
What do you mean?
Well, it seemed to me
I m never unfair.
What?
No, she went runnin off to some old house she was talkin about yesterday.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn t be up there.
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed  but she didn t tell me it was the Farren house. I ll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
Yes, daddy.
Yes, I did.
Yes, daddy.
I didn t forget.
But wishes don t come true.
But you told me in the garden that the wish about the tree couldn t come true.
I wanted to talk to you, I wanted to tell you about the other children.
It was on account of the birthday party.
They ran away.
It s true.
It was just a voice.
Daddy, it s true.
And this one s for Mrs. Farren.
Yes, Amy?
In the garden? Would she be there now?
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
But Irena is in the garden. She s right there, under the tree.
But...
But there s no one here, darling.
Yes, darling.
I don t know yet.
No.
You called me by my name.
I m your friend.
I ve wanted a friend too. I ve been lonely.
You wouldn t understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
I can not tell you.
For as long as you ll let me.
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
I ll just never learn arithmetic.
The numbers simply don t mean anything
A princess?
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
This is more fun than just pretend.
That one s an elm.
But we don t have any sea weed.
Your children?
Yes, winter s coming. I don t like the winter,
Oh, thank you, Amy.
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it! I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy. I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
It s a warm breath warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer s back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
Don t cry, Amy.
But she s dead!
Oh, it is, it is! Death s terrible.
Yes, Amy.
That s a fine looking ring.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
Maybe, if it s a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
They re given to the living in memory of the dead. If this is a real one I can t be sure you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
I m trying to.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I ve got to take back this ring.
Will you come soon?
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
But she s such a nice lady.
But what happened to the little deer?
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn t it get up?
But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
Yes, everything s all right, Edward.
And Amy mailed them?
I like to see her happy.
That s because she made a promise, and she a keeping it, aren t you, darling. You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
That many women in one place nothing good can come from that.
I don t believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
Jennifer gave her a make over.
Sorry, don t mean to be wolfing down. I m just starving.
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe " coyote ugly " is really a compliment. Like someone who s conventionally " ugly " but is really beautiful.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I ll quit someday. Doesn t it seem like all the cool people smoke?
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
I ve been working out.
I mean where on your body?
It s hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
What else is there?
Nearly four.
Okay, but I m worried about the next PMS bout. It s gotten worse. I m not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
Does she have PMS?
No it s mom.
What does that have to do with me?
No, I m not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Come on, we ve been double dating since the fourth grade.
Well that s not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton s a nice guy.
Anything s better than Mark.
Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark s an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he s never had a regular job.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you d get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
Maybe he s just shy.
Frida, I don t mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
Only to see.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn t a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
I don t know.
And she got the medium.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It s good for you to go out get your mind off Mark.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. " Can I use your phone? " " How about a nightcap? " " I want to meet your cat. " And my all time favorite, the old standby, " I have to use your bathroom. "
Are you kidding? He might as well say, " Can I date rape you? "
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
Holy shit, I m a freak.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
I m sure they were exaggerating.
Did I kill him? Of course not!
No. I don t think so.
I don t remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
I couldn t stop eating steak. I felt out of control like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn t get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
Rule one: always wear make up.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
I m sorry. I didn t want you to think I was still a doormat.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
Give him the tampon test.
You have to stop being so self critical Frida.
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
It s just as well. I m afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don t want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he s a creep.
Okay. I guess so.
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
I think he called you beautiful.
I can t help it. My bra wouldn t even fit. I ve been going to Victoria s Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I m busting out. It s this PMS.
It s just cause mine is finer. A little bleach ll fix that.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
I haven t gotten it yet.
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I ve called you for two days. Where have you been?
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Frida, Carlton s dead.
And he was missing an arm.
Okay, I gotta go.
Did you get rid of Mark?
He s been here all night?
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
Why not? There s been a murder.
What? Why d you do that?
You re right. It s just, I can t cover up a murder so George won t know you re cheating.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
I could smell another woman on him.
That s a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
No.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
Let s do some research. I ll check the libraries. You surf the web.
Peter keeps asking me out.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I m a fuckin werewolf.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven t tried that for the past 24 years.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let s find her and talk to her.
Guess she never found true love.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
So what do I do?
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
You ll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he ll be fine.
I guess you ll find out.
No. I won t let you do that.
About Mark? Carlton?
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
We were I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn t want to be with me!
Sorry I shouldn t go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you re going to be okay?
Frida? You okay?
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
So you re Grant s secretary?
I m not really hungry after all.
Well, whattdaya think?
Come on, didn t all that steak make you thirsty?
They say sex is great for cramps.
I really gotta pee.
I didn t have to pee then.
That s okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I ll leave.
Knock what off?
Yes I do have to pee!
I wouldn t mind doin something else, but I do really have to pee.
So pee? Here?
You never say that.
Oh my god, I m sorry!
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
You haven t even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
This really isn t a good time.
So pay them back and apologize.
You think that story s gonna make me loan you money?
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
On your desk.
On your desk.
Did you change your hair?
Yes, that s what we re looking for.
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
No?
Are you following me?
That s my ex. He s an asshole. In case you couldn t tell. I think he s been following me.
I m trying to stay away from caffeine.
No. Really. I don t drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
So what book did you buy?
No really, I love knowing what people read.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
I m sorry.
I m so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Sometimes it s frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don t even know what killed him. I m putting together little details to see if we re missing something.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you re in an accident? Well this guy wasn t wearing any underwear.
Briefs.
Me neither. That s why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Goodnight.
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
Oh, nothing s wrong. Just... well don t you have your period?
No. No, I m fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don t want our first time to be like this.
No. I was doing my laundry.
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It s important.
Yeah sort of. Where s Lloyd?
No, I got it. It s okay.
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it s unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
What s that supposed to mean?
No, but thanks for the warning.
This is a lot worse than " Betty. "
No, it s just... no one s ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I d have to say it first and then they d sort of say " I love you too " cause they felt they had to after I d said it.
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
They re for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
They do? Oh no...
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I m coming over.
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
I m not afraid. Frida! I love you.
I don t think you would. No matter what form you take.
Can t you bite me and then I ll be like you?
Maybe we should have children. I don t think I d kill the father of my child.
Worse than this?
What about... those guys... I might have...
I m so sorry... I... I couldn t help it. You know I didn t mean to... to do any of that.
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
We didn t have sex.
Cause I m a fucking werewolf!!
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
You got a dog?
She s just so... pathetic.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
It s so bad she becomes a werewolf.
Take some allergy medicine.
Why would you want to be a cop?
Man, you re livin dangerously. Let me ask you somethin, you always have to get women drunk before they ll sleep with you?
You re some catch Lloyd.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick s sheets from her period?
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don t have sex with a woman cause she s on the rag?
I can tell she s not a killer. You just don t like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
I told you she was innocent.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
Back in the 80 s. You didn t see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
We only live a few blocks apart.
She s not a suspect. What is her motive? There s nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
The park dude was missing an arm.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker s about to blow me away, shoot him.
It s a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
Hard to tell. Looks like he s been cleaned up and he s decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she s the one in danger. She s a woman in jeopardy and you re layin a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she s no killer.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
What makes her think that?
And that was 28 days ago today.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
What of?
Not really...
Maybe ten minutes... That  s strange.
Says he is the man s doctor... You know...
The other one?
Jesus. Small world. Where s the photographer?
How will we interrogate them?
He tried to kill me!
Just visiting my patient.
I don t know what you re talking about.
Germs, sir. These places are full of them.
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing. Anyway he isn  t with us any longer. The case is yours. Go through his files. Take what you need. By the way, how  s your mother?
I  ll be the judge of that. Anything else?
I ah couldn t think of anything else to do. I thought maybe you know something... I m scared.
Who?
Why are they after you?
What?
Well. The only thing I ve been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean. The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
I m on the serial killer case, need to talk.
What? Who has?
What is that door?
Yes.
Then we must call the police.
Shut up!
You know something about me?
You think I haven t been trying! It s like there was never anything there. Just water.
Asks my name. Over and over. Just like a broken record. Only thing is, I can t answer. I ve no idea what my name is.
Yes.
You re supposed to be my doctor, right?
I m nothing then.
I have to go...
No, it s the truth.
Not that again...
Please! Don t be foolish! Time is short. Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
It s the truth... I need you. I know you re innocent.
Of course you are. You couldn t do those terrible things. Come home with me maybe things will make sense then...
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
 Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean, if you wanted me to talk or...
What?
No more than the usual.
You re kidding?
We ll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
And we re going away for a holiday.
A month.
... Alright.
Alan
You mean the press conference? I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
I m... not... nobody...
I can t believe he d do this.
She s a little hysterical right now. We ve got her upstairs in a laundry room.
Look... at some point we re going to have to call the Vice President...
... What?
The guy s in a coma, Bob.
Bob...
TilT we figure something out.
Like how?
Mild stroke?
Up and around? Soon?
I was a senator, you know.
Is that everybody?
What about her.
And...
Fine.
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
Clean.
Clean.
We ve got nothing, Bob. This won t work.
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
Oh. Excuse me.
I don t want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
Couple of days. Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they ll burn up in your hands: seventy three percent with seniors, eighty four with working mothers...
And look at this. Russell came around on the trade bill.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Hundredth cabinet meeting. I thought it was a nice touch.
I m going to kill him.
Bob...
He s only doing what you told him to.
I heard you. You said cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter. '
Bob...
Don t do this.
Just what you think I mean.
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
Dave I m working.
I was gonna do something with Joan.
It s fine.
This is undeclared income.
The government
I m not sure.
I m not surprised. Can we save anywhere?
Choices?
You could buy it on payments.
So what do we do?
That d be great.
Look, I m sorry. I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
Extend things?
I know... I know... It s difficult for all of us. But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
I m afraid so.
I m not sure... I might have.
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
In the car?
A teleprompter.
I don t think so.
Right. Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
What?
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal... '
It s just five minutes. She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
What?
We had to, Dave. The guy s a choir boy.
Wrong...
Oh... Thanks.
Fertility beads.
Oh, come on, we re not children. I didn t have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
All I ve got is my integrity. That s all I have. Now I don t know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
What do you mean?
Dirty business we re in sometimes.
What?
Really?
Mr. Kovic. We re not here about your taxes.
What?
We d like to hire you.
I can t say.
I can t say.
Yeah.
No.
What about it?
 Bleed for your king. '
First thing they teach you at the academy.  Don t give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King. '
That s okay. You alright down here by yourself?
The Vice President...
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
I don t understand.
What s wrong with a magic trick?
I saw the light. I thought maybe you were up.
Mind if I sit down?
Anybody would have done it.
Oh yeah? Me, too.
They asked me to help.
I m not the First Lady, anymore. I shouldn t be here.
You1re leaving, too?
I don t mind.
What?
You have a lot of secrets.
You mean when I m not running the country?
You find people jobs?
It s just more than anybody else does around here.
I know.
I can t.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy ll do a little...
Yeah. And it s better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
Hi.
I know.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
We re working on it.
What about the intro?
Father Mclntire. He blessed you at the inauguration.
All set.
NO... NOOOOOOO... SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
Two of us... only two of us... me... and him.
The mainland... is dead... a dead place... nobody there...
There are no... headquarters. There are no... rebels. Only the walking dead. Don t you see. They have won.
To look... look for a place... a place to live in... an empty place... a... new... place...
Quiet!
Gasparilla?
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead... in uniform... with guns.
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
What is it if it ain t a curse?
That sounds like a curse to me.
I m sure that s true, miss. And that s why we re doin what we re doin. What s happenin underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o man. But we re gonna beat Lucifer. We re gonna put an end to what s happenin here.
That s why we didn t use prayers on this here white coat til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
Farther than you think. You ll get lost. You will. And there s Bees all through the jungle. I ain t lyin to ya. Religiosos don t lie.
Datura.
Datura Metel. The Devil s Trumpet. Don t worry. I ain t goin religioso again. It s a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It s toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it... or... in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already... but we could never find enough.
Ain t no place safe.
The hospital?
We got a boat.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
We re hopin you can show us where ta go, Toby.
We re gonna blow up the powder magazine.
We know what s down there. We did the loading and unloadin when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o damage.
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don t kill but it puts ya under fer a good night s sleep.
What you wanna do?
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I ve requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the... spacing problem... on a small island like this.
You are dying, too.
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
You can believe this, Miguel. I ll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I ll.... I ll do it.... I ll do it myself.... when it needs to be done.
Shhhhh.... Tony. Rest, rest.
God.... damn you, Rhodes!
You have ruined weeks of work here! We ve been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
Oh, I have no doubt.
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I d love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
That bastard. I didn t think he d make his move so fast.
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It s because Rhodes is a prick.
We re both gonna leave. Leave the island. I ve been talkin to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They re crated up real small. They ve got air canisters. There s food inside. Even a little motor.
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
I ll have somebody s ass for this. I ll have your ass, soldier. I m not gonna stand here and...
My... " detail ", sir. We re going to bury the heads.
Just.... following procedure, sir. They re entitled to burial.
No, sir.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Say Steve, where s your manners? Here s Mutt s brother and you don t offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
Actually I don t really know Mutt.
Don t come.
So don t goddam come! Please.
I don t think they re in school.
Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they re your mother or something. You afraid of them?
Come on. It ll help you get Chris.
Women swoon!
Needs Chris! Must have Chris!
Knox, you gotta calm down.
At Chet Danburry s house.
Well?
So you really think she means you re going with her?
What is the point?
It s every bit as hard as they say. Unless you re a genius like Meeks.
Ahh! Eat it, Dalton!
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
I don t know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you ve learned your lesson.
Sucking out the marrow doesn t mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles. You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
I told you, that s a secret.
What?
I m not?
But...
" O, no, it is an ever fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth s unknown, although his height be taken. "
Doing fine, sir.
No one, sir. It was just me. I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane s.
Yes... sir.
It s only me, Mr. Nolan. I swear. I made it up.
Yeah, chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.
Sure, but Cameron asked me too. Anybody mind including him?
Sure.
All right. I ll second that.
It s Nuwanda.
No.
What good will that do?
It does? What?
Stop what?
Sort of.
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Chet s parents don t know about it, so please keep it quiet. But you can bring someone if you like.
No.
But, Chris...
I don t care. I love you, Chris. You deserve better than Chet and I m it. Please accept these.
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
Oh, but it s fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
Well, you did! Chet found out and he s nuts. It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
Just like that?! You just knew?
And if it so happens that you re wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Are you going with Chet?
Then come with me.
Just give me one chance. If you don t like me after tonight, I ll stay away forever.
I promise. Dead Poets honor. Come with me tonight, then if you don t want to see me again, I swear I ll bow out.
Chet won t know anything. We ll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it s over.
Dead Poets honor.
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits. Do you understand?
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Meeks.
I didn t know you taught.
Your reprimand made quite an impression I m sure.
Courtyard?
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point. About the evils of conformity.
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
Yawp!
YAWP!
AHHHHHH!
A madman.
A crazy madman.
A... A sweaty toothed madman.
I... I close my eyes. His image floats beside me.
A sweaty toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Don t stop!
Ah, so you boy s have been snooping.
Okay.
Maybe they don t want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world. Seeing a student like you take root and bloom. It s worth everything. That s why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me. Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
You can t live a life for someone else, Neil. You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me? Have you shown him your passion about acting?
I know what he ll say. He ll say that acting is just a whim and that it s frivolous and that I should forget about it. He ll tell me how they re counting on me and to put it out of my mind " for my own good. "
Eighteen! That s two years! What about the play? The performance is tomorrow night!
Isn t there an easier way?
Yeah.
It s not too bad. It s a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
Why don t you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
I m sorry, Neil.
Father, I wasn t disputing you.
Yes sir. I m sorry.
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Nobody I thought I d surprise you. I ve got all As and
Father, I have the main part. The performance is tomorrow night. Father, please.
Where is this cave he s talking about?
What is it?
My brother went here.
Well, you ve won the booby prize. Don t expect to like it here.
I ll take him over mine.
Nothing.
I... I just don t want to come.
Yes. But
I don t want to read.
Keating said everybody took turns reading. I don t want to do it.
Found what?
A play, dummy.
They re putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try outs.
So I m gonna act! Ever since I can remember I ve wanted to try it. Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn t let me.
First I gotta get the part, then I ll worry about that.
As far as I m concerned, he won t have to know about any of it.
Horseshit. Nothing s impossible.
That s a laugh. If I don t ask, at least I won t be disobeying him.
What is that supposed to mean?
You want me out... is that what you re saying?
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I m not like you. When you say things, people pay attention. People follow you. I m not like that.
No! I don t know, I ll probably never know. The point is, there s nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine. All right?
No? What do you mean no?
Sssh. That s what I m taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
From my father and Nolan.
It s my birthday.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
What?
I will be with thee straight.
This play?
No thanks.
I ll come to the performance.
Yea, art thou there?
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
Do you have to quit the play?
Yes.
He s the owner...
What the hell are you talking about?
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two... are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
Which question is that?
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
Who asked any?
How soon can we get up and running?
You re going to have to get a new one.
Did you clear this?
That s where my boat s moored.
I saved your life is what I did!
The thieves.
Then who are you?
What are you people talking about?
Jesus Christ lady...
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
You people... rich people...
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
That s what I do.
Quite a few.
Anti social?
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
Hey! I didn t have to come back.
Right... You have a boat.
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
How do you know that?
You re saying they can think?
A meat locker.
What?
Yeah...
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
No...
I don t take orders at all.
So?
... we gotta get outta here NOW.
You don t give a shit about anything do you?
That s it? That s all you give a shit about?
Me??
Joey...
What? You don t think I can have a normal life?
I don t know... you got what we need?
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Squid... squid like... squid type... it s got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere... what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean... there s all sorts of shit we ve never seen... eighty foot clams... 60 foot sharks... I m just guessing... can you get me more juice out of Hercules... fast?
A little to the left...
I have been.
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
Joey...
Joey...
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN... or like made up countires too?
Maybe plans changed...
Nothing.
What is it man?
She fucked me.
She fucked you?
Yeah.
Those are mine!
Damn right!
What?
Get the boots.

Couple of weeks... Listen

Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
Yeah.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.

You talk to him?
What hospital is he in? Where?
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
No.
But you must come in.
But I insist.
Ah yes. Of course. To the girl who waits.
But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or?
I came to see Merle.
Yeah.
Where is he???
Everybody love Linda.
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?

Fine. Hey, I m fine.
Rough. We didn t have to do it, John.
No. How s Angela? How s she taking it?
No?
Talked to Sal? Sal s alive?
Nick, she won t say why.
She s out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Hi. Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
Linda... Hey, Linda...
Linda, Linda...!
Will you marry me?
Sure.
I don t know.
No.
Fine. I m fine. How are you?
That was nothing. That wasn t anything.
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don t know what that s from.
Is that what it is? I couldn t figure out.
Naw, it s... I mean...
I ll kill em. Anybody bothers you, I ll kill em!
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
What?
I don t know.
C mon. I ve got the car.
I... No. You do this for money?
Up north.
Playing.
We... Three bullets.
No. No, no.
I want to go home, Merle.
This is horrible!
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
I know.
Huh?
So do I.
Yeah.
The shot?
I don t think about the shot that much.
Yeah... I guess.
I don t know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don t know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
Yo yo! Who s a yo yo?
You re a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You re a fucking maniac!
From Nam?
Pow.
Pow.
Hell no!
From Nam?
Merle
Huh?
Hunt with Vince?

They bombed last night, right? Didn t they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
What else?
I m doing that too.
What do you think?
You re right... Okay, you re right.
Okay, okay! Okay. Okay, you re right... What about Sal?
What do you mean?
Forget Sal?
Merle...
We what?
More bullets in the gun?
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
Three bullets minimum.
I ll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
Nick!... I thought you went home.
Fine. She s fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
You wanna bet?
Watch it, shithead!
Then lemme have em.
No!!!?
What do you mean, no???
Some fuckin friend... You re some fuckin friend, Merle!
This is this, Vince. This isn t something else. This is this!
As soon as you re hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
Right.
I m gonna start slow... At the top. Then I m gonna work down.
Nick. Hey. How s things?
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
What?
John Wayne... Listen, Nick
Listen, Nick
I m gonna stay here, Nick.
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I ll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you d rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder s neat, I mean
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Nick. I m so scared. I m so fuckin scared to go home.
Yeah.
No.
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty! What s this suitcase here?
Merle?... Merle s alive? How do you know?
Merle gave me this?
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you d be
Phantom Mary?
No.
Yeah!
That s who.
Great. Feels great... Fuckin A!
Naw. Uh huh.
No.
Never one.

Yeah.
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Up.
Down.
What cha got, Bennett?
Technothugs?
Jesus. Sweet Jesus. We ve got trouble.
Well, he s sure working fast ain t he?
What did you say?
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
Kimberly!
Fuck you fuck you.
Maybe re animating you wasn t such a bright idea. You look like shit.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
Well, you ve just been taken off the bench.
Later. I want Doucet first.
He s not that old yet. You ve lost confidence in me.
We have an antidote that ll retard the aging process.
I m not voting for you.
Remember my promise.
You can t win like this. You ll only get older. This is what you wanted!
We have to talk.
That wasn t your plan, was it?
You re crazy.
We seem to ve come across a 211, sir.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
It s a real mess down here. Some thing must a gone wrong. No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
NPA syndrome will hit im fast. Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty year ratio in fractions of fives. Saying a prayer won t be bad either.
Fine.
How do I look?
I got it. I got it.
Ah Mom, you re embarrass n me.
Not the T word.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy. Status G 8. Security Clearance 3. One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant. FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division
Yes.
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
But Sergeant...
You have to use the steering wheel to turn. The pedal for gas...
Whoa. Don t touch that. Pursuit Mode. Auto pilot. Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits. Installed Fall 2006. Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
How do you know?
There s no time. There are civilians in there. It s about to go down.
Yes.
Bacon cheeseburgers.
You can t catch this man with a computer.
GCI. TM 1. What language are you talking?
' Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big time dealer. I didn t have an ID, but I was close. Too close. Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs. He was going to turn me onto the big man. He made me for a cop. Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Engaged. Plan on doing it this summer. You still married?
I ll be okay.
We get to peek into Doucet s brain.
I m serious, Wade. This case is important to me.
Yes, sir.
Great. My partner s Marcus Welby.
With all this technology you don t even have to show up for work. Who needs cops when you ve got gizmos.
No thank you, sir. Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
What else did he get?
How ya feeling?
I m here.
... What are you talking about...?
... Have you been drinking?
This should make your day. The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty four times.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
He s got my grandson, Sanchez.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
What s it mean?
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
They always are.
Yeah.
What s your name?
Hi.
This little thing says I can t.
Jabez! Careful
No, thank you what s your name?
I didn t.
Lying to you Why should I?
I know and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren t still hoping the guests might arrive.
Well, I wouldn t mind. But my name s Daniel Stone.
It hasn t opened yet?
Guess there will, if it says so.
Young man you got me there.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan l?
And what about Daniel Webster?
Why? It don t hurt.
No, Daniel they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I ve got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there s a Supreme Court fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I m a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm but the thing I d like to show you most, you ll have to see for yourself.
Well it s high and it s wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it it s the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
You re wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e er seeing it. They can t see the country for the money in their pockets And some think their state s the country, or the way they live is the country, and they re willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you ll meet all those, when you re grown. You ll meet the fire eaters and the Circassian beauties that s part of the fair, to be sure. But if we d had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
It s mine, Ma! Pa made it for me and I m not going to give it to anyone!
No! No! I won t.
Daniel!... You must go to sleep.
Move? We are not going to move the old one is good enough for us.
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain t you? Look out you don t fall off.
Howdy, Hank.
Why, of course, Hank I ve always got time for a neighbor. What s on your mind?
I don t know don t seem much of an idea to me.
Oh you don t have to go to Miser Stevens while I m around.
Not at all, Hank... not at all. Glad to help you.
Too bad it didn t happen to Miser Stevens.
Sure am.
Why not! There s a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We ve come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
No. She s gone.
Belle.
Well, Stone have you got the money?
No, Stone!
I d like to know where you d get it....
Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
Hello, Stevens... you re early today.
No, you re not.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
You are afraid!
Of what happens after we die!
But what becomes of our souls?
Don t say that I know it is
What if one hasn t a soul any more? What of that?
I do and I think you should too.
You can t say that to me! I m New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did. I guess I did.
Opportunities?
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But
Oh, you know the old story the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
That s right, Mr. Stone there is just one little formality. I d like your signature here see. And when it s done it s done for seven years. It s our usual form. Of course we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
Well, I ll be
The seventh day of April
Look here now
I don t care.
Leave your tongue off of that!
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship
He ain t dead he s dancing in there.
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary. Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I d have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing. In your case
I m through with you.
I have still a year a year to make up for everything.
Not now! Not now! Let me make up let me make up.
Anything anything. You can have it all back that money the new house my farm the whole caboodle!
No! No! No! Not him not my son I d rather go with you right now.
About what?
Yes, I did but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience. Is this your signature?
Seems like it s my fault, Mr. Webster.
Mr. Webster I d like you to meet my wife, Mary.
That s just fine, Neighbor Stone but I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez anybody in public life has that difficulty even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I ve got the good of mankind always at heart, and I ve got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I m talking about, Jabez?
You, Jabez Stone you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
I I don t know what you re talking about! I I haven t time to listen to all this
Yes, Mr. Webster it was here where it all began.
Not long now.
There s no joy in it for me.
Well, I
Headache Squire?
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez? Well mighty elegant house you got here.
Oh yes yes. Won t take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Dan l Webster is coming to my party.
Yes and that s the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
Now look here s a list of the people I invited they re all the right kind of people or did I miss anybody?
You want me to go around
You mean that s all you had me come out here for?
Well yes
You are not so sure that he ll come.
Why not?
5000 that s just what I owe you.
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he s feeling the spring a coming, too.
Now, Jabez! I ve got on my Sunday bonnet and I m going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter and if that isn t an occasion, I don t know what is.
Oh, Jabez.
Jabez, don t you remember your own wedding? We said it s for better or worse. We said it s for richer or poorer.
Who is it?
That s wonderful language. It would move a stone.
We can still use my butter money.
Do you think I m grudging it?
Not all of it?
It s all right, Jabez. We ll find something to pay Stevens.
Jabez! Couldn t you take a sack of seed instead?
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think
Jabez you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
Seed alone won t do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
Jabez...
Jabez!
Well I I don t know I would pay our debts and well maybe get a new bonnet, but really I think I would live the same.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
Tired?
There is nothing to worry about now.
Yes you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a starting up All the seeds a stirring underneath the ground
I ll get it, Jabez.
I ll never get my washing done.
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
It s very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
But Jabez the washing has to be done
No, no. I don t want to be idle.
What in sugar hill s the matter with him?
I am going to lock him up.
Isn t that your own fault?
He s my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it s not the boy it s me. You don t like the way I live you don t like my friends, or my new house or anything.
It shows on your face.
It s different, Jabez that s all.
Jabez!
Consarn the consarn
Hard luck like me.
I just figgered knew you didn t have enough bills.
That s a word you re too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that...
I dunno.
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good. Consarn it. He s better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...... up there, just what I think.
Yes I was getting the seed I stumbled I saw one of the boards warped up a bit and there it was.
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We ve got enough for the whole United States.
Lan s, I d think you was having the baby, to hear you.
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
Why, that s just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster guess they pay him high for what he does. But he s worth it and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
Ma and yet, a man could change that, couldn t he?
It don t matter!
I say it don t matter.
You ll be a father any minute now.
Ma!... Where s Mary... and little Dan l?
It s all right, Sheriff.
Let him try it.
Hello, Jabez I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Jabez seems like I ve been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
Mary Jabez
The new girl Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Now, Ma You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
You aren t angry with me?
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa s the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain t seen em yet.
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
You ve got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
No, really, thank you. Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
Of course not
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I ve done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
Why yes it s hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There s this matter of little Daniel s schooling and the new house and well there s something else that s wrong it gets worse, year after year it s like a shadow growing I can t really talk about it, even to Ma she puts it all on Jabez and I won t stand for that.
Mr. Webster, you mustn t believe all that people say.
You see, I don t care if we are rich or poor I don t care if we re big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money we were poor as Job s turkey, but none of us minded. Now I ve seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I ve seen him get hard and mean, and he isn t hard or mean. I ve heard him mock at the church bells the bells that rang for our wedding. That s not like him, Mr. Webster It must be my fault somehow my fault.
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster?
Mary what love and trust could do for your husband, you ve done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
Oh it s you again. What do you want?
I d rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
It even kicked back once at you, didn t it?
Oh.. not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster! Cup for cup what do you say?
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence if you have it.
H m. This appears I say appears to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn t property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
Well, I never heard the dev of your claiming American citizenship.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
I do! If I can t win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren t a match for the devil, we d better give this country back to the Indians.
Let it be the quick or the dead So it is an American judge and an American jury!
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn t let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there I ll give you an extension if you ll forget this stupid repentance idea.
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
You can talk to me...
Why don t you?
Do I? I m sorry. You re gonna have to help me, man. This is my first time driving a limo.
The past six months.
You re nosey, you know that, Argyle?
It s okay, it s okay.
But meant her moving here.
So, why didn t you come?
It s corny, but I could live with it.
They don t look happy... something s gone wrong.
John.
How about his job?
I m tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them... or your husband. Hi there.
Ellis, what have you told them?
That asshole s not my friend! I barely know him! I hate his fucking guts Ellis, for Christ s sake, tell him you don t mean shit to me
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they re motivated, they re happening. They want something. Now, personally, I don t care about your politics. Maybe you re pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it s the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that s none of my business. I figure, You re here to negotiate, am I right?
Hey, business is business. You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what s the difference? To put it in my terms, you re here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn t expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building. Hans, baby... I m your white knight.
If you d listened to me he would be neutralized already!
You want... money? What kind of terrorists are you?
Who are you, then?
I wouldn t think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers. I really dug those sequined shirts.
I m a cop from New York.
One weekend I went to a combat ranch... You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint? Must sound pretty silly to you...
Put it down now.
I m going to count to three...
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
Whoa, Hans, now you re the cowboy?
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock... that s out of my hands.
Oh? What idiot put you in charge?
We have a pregnant woman out there relax, she s not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn t doing her back any good. I d like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there s a sofa.
Good enough. And unless you like is messy, you d better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
It s a long story. You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
Oh... Where does he live?
Especially my name. You must miss it every time you write a check. When did you start calling yourself Ms. Gennero?
Sure. It s unnerving. I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash... I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
No matter what it did to our marriage?
Oh, here it comes. One of those meaningful relationship conversations. I never should ve let you get those magazine subscriptions
Holly Gennero?
I ve spent half my life on airplanes,  I can recognize someone who just got off one. I m Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane. I have... something to do with this company.
Can I get you anything? Food? Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
I m ahead of you... partner.
Got it... Roy. Now listen. If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don t be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole up and let us do our job. Understand?
Al, what s wrong? Did something Oh, God. You re coming in! That s it, isn t it? Christ, Powell, I told you what you re dealing with here
The plastique I found. Is the building on fire?
' Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye  5. '
I m here, cowboy.
Don t tell me, partner. I m just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
Yeah. But all things being equal, I d rather be in Philadelphia. By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
I... I m sorry. I didn t mean to make a joke of it.
I still feel like shit.
I got it. But you can tell her yourself. Just watch your ass and you ll make it.
Roy?
Bullshit.
Dwayne Robinson. Well, what have you learned? What do they want?
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
He claims? Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who
How do you know?
What s it look like? We re going in.
All we know? We don t know shit, Powell. If there s hostages why hasn t anyone asked for ransom? If there s terrorists, where s their goddamn list of demands? All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you ve been talking to on the radio!
Yessir.
Christ, can t you read between the lines! He did everything he could to save him... if he gave himself up they d both be dead!
He s alone, tired, hunted, and hasn t seen diddly squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you re going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you re shoveling!
Yes, I would.
What about the kids?
Heidi, I m dying.
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
Don t call yourself fat.
Heidi why didn t you come down here?
They re not after you, they re after me.
Jackie what are you talking about?
Well, how ll I get home?
He says he doesn t know. Why don t you cook whatever s there?
The robbers in the bank. They got guns?
Well, stay away from them. Don t get close.
Hello, Sonny.
Well... I m out of the hospital.
I never thought I d get out this way. I ll tell you.
Ooohh....
I m really shakey.
Yeah. It was terrible.
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy. And they start putting things in your arm... you know. How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you re asleep all the time?
You can t talk or do anything. You really feel... you know... I m just sort of coming out of it now.
Yeah. So how are you?
Yeah... I know.
What? What are you talking about? You are dying? Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
What do you mean... what am I talking about? Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life? I am dying. Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
No really... I don t think that you realize what it means. The things that you do, Sonny. You put a gun to somebody s head...
Yeah... obviously you don t... when you put a gun to somebody s head... and you say go to sleep so that it won t hurt when I pull the trigger. Death? Don t talk about death to me. I have been living with death for the last six months. Why do you think I m in the hospital? I take a handful of pills to get away from you. And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again. I have no friends left. No job. I can t live. I have to live with people. This death business... I m sorry!
I m sorry...
But I didn t ask you to go rob a bank.
Well...
What trip?
I m free to do what I want? And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane? Where? Where ya going?
You re crazy.
You re really crazy.
Where you gonna go?
Why you going to Algeria?
Howard Johnson s... you re warped. You know that? You re really warped!
God, Algeria! Do you know there s a bunch of... they walk around there... God! People walk around with masks and things on their heads. They re a bunch of crazy people there.
I don t know... you could have picked a better place.
I like that... yeah!
Sal? Yeah... Sal is with me.
I know I am. I know!
He ain t going out. And if I go out he s just gonna kill the people. There s a lot of lives that I m responsible for... that s all. So, I can t do anything. I got myself into this mess and I ll get myself out of it... the best way I know how! One of the ways is not giving up. I m telling ya!
What?
How did they think that? What are they... crazy? What do you mean. That s bullshit, Leon. They re giving you a fucken story.
Oh... they re fucken crazy. That s a snow job. Don t listen to that shit!
Shit...
All right. Then what do you want me to say?
Where are they now? Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
That s great. Just terrific. You talk to me with them on the phone, right? That is really smart. And, you don t tell me?
You don t have a choice?
Look... who s on the phone?
Who s on the phone, now? What do you mean... throw it on you? You knew it, right?
All right, enough! Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway? Is that you Moretti? You on the phone? Will somebody talk to me?
Are they on the phone still?
All right! He didn t do it. All right? Now... would you get the fuck off the phone? I ll bet that really changed them, huh? Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
That s good then. You ve found something.
Do you still want the operation?
Well, then...
I don t know what to say to ya! I guess I just wanted to say I ll see ya... or whatever.
Right. See you sometime.
Yeah... I ll write a song. Ha, ha. I don t know. Life is funny!
Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
Oh no!
I can t help it. I can t stop him from anything.
He won t listen to anybody. He s been very crazy all summer. Since June he s been trying to kill me.
What good is that? They couldn t stop him. And it d just make him mad. They don t know him.
He was under great strain: you don t understand, he s a very mixed up person.
He s scared. It s crazy. I never met anyone like him. His wife, he s a wonderful father to his children. His mother you should see her his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable. I wanted to get married... He didn t really want it... he s married already! But he did it. I don t know why. I thought it would help me, but it didn t. I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City Sonny was frantic he knew I was drinking; he didn t know where I was... who I was with. I couldn t explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man s body. So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that? 2500 dollars! My God, he s in hock up to his ears already.
It made him crazy so much demand, he d fly into this rages. And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I d never get the operation. So I tried to take my life I swallowed about a half pound of pills... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital. Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: Wow! So when I hear he s in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he s doin it for me.
I can t talk to him.
I m afraid.
I don t know what to say to him. I can t.
What are you doin in there?
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
I told you keep away. I don t know what we do now.
They re okay.
I m not alone.
I got Sal.
What do you want to know that for?
Call me Sonny boy.
One word. You won t find it in the phone book.
Call me whatever you want.
I frisk you?
Right I m with you, buddy.
Sure... like... I m not gonna shoot you.
They re what s keeping me alive. You think you re dealing with an idiot? Talk to me then.
Oh, no... Women is all we got.
Come on. I want you to see something.
... armed robbery...
When I m bein fucked, I like to be kissed a lot. Who the fuck are you tryin to con me into some deal? You re a city cop, where s the FBI? This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they re gonna bury me! You know it, you can t talk for them, you re some flunky pig tryin to bullshit me. Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
I want to see my wife. I want you to bring her down here.
What do you want?
Nothin doin. I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
They were...
No, I m not tryin to fuck you.
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it...
Wait a minute... everything you asked for is on the way...
Is on its way... The helicopter can t land but we got a bus... the jet s on its way to Kennedy... we got a bus coming here...
Sonny, your wife s on the way... We reached her... your wife s on the way... everything you asked for, you got.
It can t happen again... I ll do everything I can to stop anything I can...
Can t land... you d kill people...
I m not... I m not... you re gettin a bus... you re gettin a bus... the jet s comin into Kennedy... and your wife s on the way... what else do you need? What else can I get you? Listen, I don t know how you can do better... see that man over there... the FBI guy...
There won t be... there won t be... What else do you need? How else can we help you?
What else?
Aspirins... okay you got it. Charlie! Six pizzas!
He s all doped up.
What makes you think you ll be able to control it?
He hasn t so far. I m the one who can make a mistake. That s what scares the shit out of me.
It s all we got.
Believe me, I m on your side.
Mulvaney...
Well, they go to guard school.
I got two kids... and I d like to see them again.
I don t care who you are... I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
If you take anybody, please take me.
What now, Sonny?
I don t know, Sonny... on the roof somewhere I guess.
You know more than the Doctor? You re not okay, look at you. Come on...... let s get him out...
I stay here. Damn it. I just needed the insulin. I m used to it. Go on. Go on.
I ll be God damned if you will.
They look like good kids.
Special to me, too.
Sure we like you.
I m sorry.
We like you, too.
Would I hire you?
Why not?
Yeah?
No. I had some legal training, but...
What now, Sonny?
Everything s all right? You okay?
Little smoke: like a Polish four alarm fire, is all.
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
I m glad it s okay.
You were terrific, too!
It was on the TV.
Oh, a long time. Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be? He wasn t around here. I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
No, not until after they killed him.
Yeah.
Because I m scared, that s why. You never smoked?
You stopped? Why?
Pure?
For God s sake! As soon as I m outta this bank robbery, I m gonna stop... okay?
My body? What for?
You re serious!
You know, you remind me of my 19 year old brother only he s got his hair down to his knees he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it s illegal and he storms outta the house. You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
Let s go, Sonny.
What?
I want him to think that.
Are you serious? About throwin a body outta here if we have to?
But do you mean in?... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
But I want to know what you think.
Dead or alive?
All right... send them the guard.

What kind of a deal?
What do you mean? You talkin about coppin a plea?
... because if you re talking about coppin a plea, I m tellin you right now, there s no deal... I m never going back to prison... We got our own deal already... Do you remember the pact we made? You and me and Jackie that night in the bar... we were talkin about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do... Right? What did we say? What did we say!
Does that still go?
Wyoming.
Yeah...
Get over there!
They keep sayin two homosexuals. I m not a homosexual. I want you to stop them saying that.
He was talkin about arrangements... we were talkin about the TV.
Okay, Sonny.
I m here.
No more favors. That s all over, Sonny.
I ve got a jet. I ll have airport limousine here in a half hour. I want the hostages.
Okay, when do I get them?
I want them all.
You got guts. You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we re gonna let you out?
I wouldn t like to, but I will, if I have to.
What can he do, he s clean...
I am.
What s the matter... they never housebroke you?
I forgot she s in here.
What is it? Did you just barge in here... He doesn t have plan. It s all a whim. Rob a bank! What not? '
He s got diabetes. He s not a well person.
My God, Sonny you oughtta see Alla Brooklyn is here! On all 3 networks!
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it s gonna be okay.
Well, I m only trying to get you outta this. I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the 64 convention, but you had marital problems...
I said you were never a faggot.
He was very understanding you ought to talk to him... Algeria?
What s wrong with that? The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him. Everybody knows it isn t you... It s the pressures from your home life.
Did I say a thing against her? God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
If she comes down here, so help me I m gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her. Since then, forget it.
I know you wouldn t need Leon if Heidi was treating you right. The thing I don t understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway? You got two kids on welfare now. What re you goin to bed with her, you don t have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
What ll you do? Come out.
Oh. Run.
Maybe...
No!
No. This really pissed him off, Sonny. He says you re dead. He says he doesn t have a son.
Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.
How much?
The Bounty Hunters have arrived. They will drop off the money in exactly one hour. Where do you want to meet?
I forgot.
He killed two children.
We gotta bring him in.
The children like to urinate in the balls.
What about your toe?
Did it hurt?
What?
What happened to them?
Remove...... the... right arm.
What?
Yep.
Where is the money?
I think that you re lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
Yes.
That s the rumor on the street.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
No. Please enlighten me.
Chi Chi! CHI CHI!
Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
Crypto fascist? Who talks like this?!
Must you use that awful word?
Stop it.
I said stop it.
It s Choco. And he s not my boyfriend. He s a bounty hunter.
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
Hello?
There are no bond certificates.
No. What s the big deal?
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
Do you know where Danang is?
And he used to fuck a Playboy centerfold every night.
Okay. Domino Harvey is here.
Your theory is valid... in theory.
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
Gotta go.
OK. OK.
That s it?
How old are you?
What makes Sammy run?
What makes Sammy run?
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store. How much will it cost me?
Eddie, you re too smart for your own britches. Listen to me. How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
Wake up!
It s gonna be hot today.
Don t ya love ya brother Mookie anymore? I loves ya, Jade.
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Later for Sal. Y know, sometimes I think you re more concerned with him than me.
Slavery days are over. My name ain t Kunta Kinte. Sis, I don t want to argue, stop pressing me.
Don t worry bout me. I always get paid.
What responsibilities?
I m coming.
Yo, I m gone.
Stop tripping.
What are you so worked up about?
He s just being nice.
He s completely innocent.
I didn t stutter. You heard me.
You are too crude.
One has nuthin to do with the other.
I m getting paid...
Pretty soon I ll be making a move.
Who doesn t work? Don t start no shit, won t be no shit.
Depends.
Can t do.
You know you don t get paid till we close tonight. We re still open.
Mookie, I don t know what you re talking about, plus I don t want to hear it.
I didn t say nuthin. You must have a guilty conscience. What are you guilty of?
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
Sal, I want my money.
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
Fuck dat. The time is fuckin now. Y know I m sorry bout Sal s Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
We all know you re gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
Quit bullshitting.
You only pay me two fifty a week. I owe you fifty bucks.
You keep it.
You gonna open up another Sal s Famous Pizzeria?
Make dat money. Get paid.
I can dig it. It s gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
Gotta go.
OK. OK.
I work too, but I still make time.
I want you to spend some time with me. I want you to try and make this relationship work. If not, I d rather not be bothered.
When?
Bring some ice cream, I m burning up. Do you love me?
What took you so long? Is it hot?
How else was I going to get you here? I haven t seen you in a week.
Where s the ice cream? The H  agen Dazs butter pecan?
Your memory is really getting bad.
I can run out and get it.
I can t be staying long anyway.
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
Then we ll do something else.
Trust me.
Mookie, I told you already it s too fucking hot to make love.
I m sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
Of course I m sweating. I m burning up. It s hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
It s pose to be cold.
Meda. Meda.
To get my money.
Tina, I ll be right back.
Later.
Fuck dat shit. I deliver pizzas. That s what I get paid for.
Da Mayor ain t no bum.
What?
Magic Johnson.
Y know, I ve been listening and reading bout Farrakhan, ya didn t know that, did you?
Fuck you. Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so called " day " when the Black man will rise. " We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past. " You really believe that shit?
Keep dreaming.
Ya like him, huh?
Y know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should " house him. " Kick his ass.
If you don t make a stand, he s gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
That s what I think.
Sez who?
I love you.
Good. I want you to listen.
Good. Vito, you trust that Mook too much. So does Pop.
You listening to me?
Mookie is not to be trusted. No Moulan Yan can be trusted. The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here. In the back.
I know.
I know so. He, them, they re not to be trusted.
I like Mookie a lot.
I didn t want to come to work anyway. I hate this freakin place.
Mookie, you re fucking up.
Since when do you know what s best for us?
Too many pizzerias already there.
We don t know nuthin else.
Pop, what else can I say? I don t wanna be here, they don t want us here. We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You re " it " until you touch someone else.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
In the new library there.
Depends how you define new...
Yeah. How d you know?
Four colors? Neato!
MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
A ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn t moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there... I m sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
We re all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Come over around seven.
Yeah...
Ooh gross.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? You had questions?
That s okay. Lloyd s really the one teaching the class.
She says that she s got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
I m fine.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here s thought, have you a bathroom?
Are you kidding? I couldn t be more okay.
Are you kidding? I ll be down in a " I crapped my pants. "
That s stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I m asleep. HARRY Dunne.
Probably because we ve never met.
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I m talking to Santa s kid!
Home school. Til today.
I go to school where I live.
Is that what I think it is?
Cool.
I don t know. I m pretty familiar with the school and I ve never seen that " X ". But... I do know something.
Don t we want them to talk to us?
Why not?
How nerdy is that? I m wearing two pairs right now.
Yeah, it s nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
The principal.
Oh, is this your special place?
Can we eat there tomorrow?
The second R is silent.
Who s Captain Rob?
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
Sounds like a pirate.
Yeah, he s a pirate.
Peg leg?
Exactly! A pirate!
What?
She did not.
LLOYD, she s my mom.
Will not.
Shut up!
You re not my real dad.
Shut Up! Buttlick!
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain. Now how about a slushee?
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
HARRY, I said don t dress like a Queen!
Our own special bus.
Sucks for you.
I don t know. I haven t decided yet.
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
Some what?
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
You can t marry my mom.
Shut up!
Just wanted to see how your doing.
I m sure you re overreacting.
You re always your harshest critic.
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
I bet you want your head scratched.
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave before I imagine something horrible.
HARRY!
Go away, assface.
Yeah, right. Why don t you show it to your " girlfriend "?
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you know what.
Me, me, me!
No. What happened?
A blimp.
Who?
Yeah, that s why I asked.
I know I did.
Am not.
He s like the Pope. Like we re gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn t listen.
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
I lugged it all over town!
But I ate your Mom s pie.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
He s so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
Right.
Damn! What are the odds?
Try one in a million!
That s gross.
Special Needs class.
You re just jealous.
If dou re trying to get in, dou re doo late.
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
You know, " some ". The fag stuff.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
Maybe it s this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
Me too. I m almost there.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins s office, did you see any kind of chest?
Duh. I m in your class at school.
I don t know if you d call us " friends "...
Can you believe it?
That s the downside. There is none.
We re not crazy. We re " special ". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
So I guess you ll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You ll be fine.
I don t think he ll smell anything just make sure he takes the check. I ve been through this a hundred times.
What does Leto say, Piter?
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron. I...
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
Yes?... How was your journey?
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him " The Duke, " " My lord, " or " Sire. " And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind " Noble Born. "
Basically...
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice this morning..... I m not in the mood.
I m sorry Gurney.
Is this what you seek?
Would you really have drawn my blood?
Paul!! Paul!!
My Lord?
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we re to secure our place among these Fremen. I will try to pass within.
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
It could only be one thing.... It s a crysknife.
Your Reverence.
Where are we do you think?
The spice! It s in everything here. The air, the soil, the food... It s like the Truthsayer drug..... It s a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me. But thanks to your teachings it s changed my consciousness. I can see it... I can see it.
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
Yes...
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
No.
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Always.
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
Could I be known as Paul Muad dib?
I have heard of it. REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
Those sounds could be imitated.
I know. But if it is a trap then why are we going?
It is my home.
" Beg to differ?! " Hey, I m talkin about my duplex in Burbank!
It s a pleasure...
Yes. There is nothing more comfortable.
No.
I told you, I don t want any of your goddamn coffins.
I don t want anything. I m just a really big, big fan. I ve seen all your movies.
Because I m planning on dying soon.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
Thank you.
Don t you bave a car?
I have no next picture.
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
The women?
I never thought of that.
Well... I guess I should go. Perhaps we could get together again?
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Do you want me to get it for you?
Well, It s about how people have two personalities. The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
I don t understand.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
I am always on time.
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
But, I don t like horses. Do I have to get on one?
Who do I play?
That s good. I could use the money.
Hmm... my biggest hit? That would probably be " Dracula. "
So let s make another " Dracula. " Let s make " The Return of Dracula "!
Dracula?
Ah! This is very exciting.
I didn t feel well...
Goulash.
Morphine, with a demerol chaser. Eddie, I m so broke. I don t know what I m gonna do...
" Greetings. I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure. " Audience laughs. Applause. " Say, that s a funny place to sleep. "
" Oh, tract housing, huh? " Laugh. " You need a new real estate agent. "
I never said I could ad lib...
So how d we do?
Mmph? Where am I?
I m not getting near that goddamn thing. One of those burned me on " The Return Of Chandu. "
That s fine, Bela. We re still rolling. Just say " Dear, you re lovely. "
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget. Just keep looking forward.
Eddie, you screwed up.
Really?
So why didn t you do it?
But maybe not.
You ll be fighting with the octopus.
This ll look a lot better. We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Once you re in it, it warms up.
Huh?
Don t let me slow you down.
That s fine, Eddie. All in the line of duty.
Well, there aren t too many other fellas I d do it for...
Shit! Bela, what s with the gun?
I was thinking about killing myself.
Eddie, I received a letter from the government. They re cutting off my unemployment. That s all I ve got. Without it, I can t pay the rent...
It ll be wonderful. We ll be at peace. In the afterlife, you don t have to worry about finding work.
I m sorry, Eddie. I m so sorry.
Isn t it wonderful? After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Really? I don t feel so great.
No, this is just the second unit. We ll do the main footage later.
Eddie, how was I?
Did you see that kid grab Vampira s tits?
Yeah, she s really somethin.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
I don t know. Where?
I dunno. Lie on the beach?
And once I m a woman, Jean Claude and I are getting married
You mean a Tesla coil?
These shoes are itchy.
This is kind of a stream
And who may you be?
Ah. The director of " Glen Or Glenda. "
I guessed.
It s that easy?
Cris, you made it. Thanks a lot.
Well... there s a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re addicted to methadone.
Isn t he?
What?
Ed, it was only one review.
Ed, you re still young. This is the part of your life when you re supposed to be struggling.
You got the job?!!
Better than not getting a job?
Who? Robert Taylor?!
Boris Karloff!?
You met Basil Rathbone!
Boy, I can t even remember the last time he was in a picture.
Since I was a kid. My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing. It just kinda became a habit.
This is my way of telling you
Of course it is. And that s why you should play the part.
That s not the issue!! Ugh! How can you act so casual, when you re dressed like that?!
Hon, nobody s bothered but you. Look around they couldn t care less.
I don t know. It s so much money...
But Ed, we re not even married. And you don t have a job.
Toss us out on our ass.
Ed, it s just one man s opinion!
Tell him " Bride " is in pre production.
That s the problem! Nobody cares about my movie! I m tryin so hard, I don t know what else to do!
Dolores, don t you understand? I m a director now! I made " Glen Or Glenda. " Directing is my day job.
Who do you think s been paying the rent?! Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
I wanted you to say, " No! I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores. "
Like what?!
I told you this was gonna happen.
That s moronic. Why would a bit player impress a backer?
That s a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
So WHAT?? Look, we gotta figure out where we re gonna stay.
Of course I m here. Today is the file clerk s big scene.
Oh really? How much money did he put up?
Wood Productions. The mark of quality.
Oh. Er... well you re the file clerk. You re hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
Ed, it s over. I need a normal life.
But you used to say
I understand you just moved here?
Perhaps a small amount of money. How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
Oh my, this is very interesting. Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
Well then you should pay him, shouldn t you?
What are you looking at me like that for? I already gave you my three hundred.
What other sixty thousand?
No he s not! Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years? " Dracula "! " The Raven "! " The Black Cat "!
That s not true
Hruphh...?
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
You could say that
Raising money is tough.
Would that work?
Graverobbers from what??
It s a guaranteed blockbuster!
Yeah, well we ve GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
Just, it doesn t look like very much.
" Perfect "? Mr. Wood, do you know anything about the art of film production?!
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
Yes?
Tor!
Mm, not good lookink enough.
But what bout accent? Some people tink I haf too much accent.
I like. When do movie shoot?
Really? Was the third act too intense?
But Tor, it s a starring part! You re second billed.
Uh, I don t have much of an appetite lately.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
Yes, I m Ed Wood. I m here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
So you re not gonna make the movie?
Well, Mr. Weiss, I m your guy. I work fast, and I m a deal: I write AND direct. And I m good. I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Are you a fruit?
So you re not a fruit?
You gotta be kiddin me.
Tits.
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you d have something!
No! It would be something better! Something impressive. The biggest moneymaker you ve ever had!
Yeah! Lugosi!
No, he s not dead! He lives in Baldwin Hills. I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
There s still a sex change
I don t think he s a schmuck.
Don t worry. We re not gonna film any of it.
Yeah? Whatever. So did you like it?
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot. Maybe they won t notice.
Um, I guess
Why?! I did all those things! Hell, I even built the props.
Why not??
Maybe it needs special handling.
You can t talk that way about my movie.
Hello. You re sleeping in a tuxedo.
Oh. Congratulations.
Booties for my father. He gets cold in this hospital.
Oh, hi.
I am. How s your father?
I just picked them up on the way over...
No. I m from back east. You know, All American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
What do you mean?
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month. But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
Huh?
No! I love sex with girls.
Ed, you ve got to snap out of this. Bela s dead you re not!
Well you tried
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
Uh, atomic energy?
Dynamite
The sun.
The poor girl s out of a job.
Who s Dr. Tom?
Ed, you re gonna miss your own premiere.
Let s get married.
Right now. Let s drive to Vegas!
Yes?
No. I think my film is perfect for you.
Please! It ll only take a minute. You can have some hors d oeuvres, and meet my backers! There s a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
Didn t you just make one called " Bride Of The Atom "?
It s terrible. People won t even return my calls. It s like I don t exist.
You don t wanna be noticed?
What s uncanny?
Don t you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
It s made from specially bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
No, I work in pictures. I m a director actor writer producer.
Two people do. Orson Welles and me.
What if you re vomiting?
Do they show it?
No! Do they show you having sex?
At what point?
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
Come on...
Who?
Yeah, so...?
Well, I don t think you can get more common than me, Al.
No.
Al!
Al!!
Yes!
I m moving out.
I m going to be living with my brother. He s not in such good shape as I am, but... I m looking forward to the pillow fights.
What?
You re nuts.
What do you mean " they re gonna have him die? "
This is real, Bananahead!
She doesn t give a shit about him.
What?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Excuse me.
Cool.
No, uh...
Don t say that. That s like... telling a guy before you have sex you d better be good. You don t do that.
Could we just talk alone for a second? I
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
We re going to get you a bodyguard, don t worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We re picking up Ed TV for another month!
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
You asked me if I had a dream. I said " Sure, I have a dream. I just don t know what it is yet. "
What if Shari s the dream?
Yeah, that s why I called. I mean, maybe Fed Ex would tell me where she moved
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren t making fun of them. They weren t bozos! I m Pumpkin Ass again!
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say " Leave her be, see other people for a while. " You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
This guy.
What are you talking about? He s fine. He s out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
Look at this people are getting married, they re getting married...
Tell me.
I m gonna stick this right in your eye.
So do I. So what? I m doing all right.
Yeah. You did good. What s wrong?
No! Don t Oh, wow.
When? Today?
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
Right, right...
Right.
Yeah?
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Send him? Ma, I can t. it s just come out here. Please, I
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother s girlfriend.
He made a mistake.
No. Maybe he s watching. Tell him you re sorry. Tell him you 11 stay away from that girl.
I don t know. She s living with that " entertainer "...
Mm.
Oh my God!
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
He says
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn t leave til I was twelve.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
Could ve been a nurse?
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
And what did he come back now for?
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you re famous and he can get something from you. I don t wan you to become a victim like Marcia. Not that you re a victim, honey. You re not. Life s just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
Mom?
What s the matter?!
Oh God. What hospital?
It was horrible. He called me up.
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him
The doctor said you were having sex.
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn t know.
Why? How...
But Al is your husband now!
You re famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
Ma...
And how is this helping? come on say, good night to all your new friends and let s go home.
She really doesn t want you and the camera in here right now.
No.
She left.
What are you talking about?
I m sorry. Where d they send her?
They re gonna mock our foibles.
Ed, he needs a break. You don t know what kind of bad luck he s had
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn t put him out.
Never would be plenty.
What s the deal? Did anybody make a decision
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
You batted or you bunted?
Well, then I m quitting.
I hear the dog really liked him.
Hey, believe me 1 know I ve got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they re really tangled...?
Dynamite.
So maybe this is my dynamite.
Right.
I m not. I m not. I m just Look you know, in a way, it s good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it s not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something
Okay...
It s... okay
Well, when you put it that way.
Can t we just
Yeah. I mean for months I ve been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
Really?
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
The what?
Oh yeah.
That s lucky.
Why?
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we re doing because... they went away.
I know, I...
I really like you too...
... yeah, then, but...
Shari...
No. Who?
Ohh...
Who cares? I don t ca No. I do care. Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy one percent. The other...
Exactly. Boy, you re smart. Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you? " Is she good enough for Ed? " Who the hell am I? Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
Really?
So?
Oh Je couldn t he sleep with Rita? We 11 all have a good time.
Come on, let s go.
Just... just relax. Okay? We won t do anything. We 11 just sit here for a while.
Are you all right?
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
No... Could you?
The what?
Everybody s someone.
What did you do to your hair?
What do we have to do?
Where were you?
What?
What are you drunk?
What is?!
You re in show business?
That s like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they re in the NBA.
Thumbsucker!
What?
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something
What?
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
Screw off.
I don t know.
Hey. You know we re not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please
Yeah?!
No. What happened?
No, this is great. You ll love this. He s a singer.
Ray
What s the dif
She didn t know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They
Great.
You watching the ballgame?
Oh. All right. I 11 watch at home, then.
It s the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment she s very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she s all " I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great... " Next thing I know we re...
You brought the cameras here!
Please!
Yeah.
I know.
Me?!
Let s remember how I got into this. " Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can t get a break. "
Yeah. My problem is I ve got a brother who writes a sentence like " We grew up in a small, little bedroom. " As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
Me?! That s you!
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn t you just say so? Why are you giving me a song and dance about being tired?
Who s Shari?
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you...? I mean how does anyone... wind up like this?
The whole time? Eighteen years?
What...
Oh, man! So...
So you saw me on TV and you said " Hey, let me jump on this. "
Ed... I m sorry.
What...
Do you still have it?
We have to stop meeting like this.
No.
No. It s going to be about a half hour.
Good?
Ed?
That s the point this could change things.
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
Some more make up wouldn t do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
Pierdo.
Pierdes.
Don t tell me that. I don t want to know that.
Look, Jim... Okay. I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger. But now it s different. Jim, what I m trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
Yeah, it s serious. I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
That s the whole point. It s all in my head; it s right here. I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it. It s beautiful.
That was just talk! Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts? We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn t mean anything. I would never... I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code. The line you ve crossed is... it s illegal and it s immoral.
Well, I notice you don t seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
I know. I know its not by choice. I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
Thank you.
Anything wrong?
Jim, don t. You re scaring him.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Yeah, just
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
What?
Dick... Dick,..
Tammy, now we ve come to a decision. He just think it would be best
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
Okay. Yeah. We know
I m not supposed to tell. Not until you ve counted too. We re each supposed to make an independent count.
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they ve changed in any way
Yeah?
See, it doesn t add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
I know.
... the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Hey, that s super
You can put those in my box. I ll look at them tomorrow.
Aren t you supposed to keep them?
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Should be easy. So far no competition.
Sure
Calm down, Tracy. Just calm down.
If it s about the posters, I think it s so awful. It s a travesty.
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
6: 30. How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it? Whom should we " interrogate? "
Why are you lecturing me?
I don t know what you re referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn t acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
I m looking at new cars.
My mother s buying me a new car for college.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Yeah.
Uh huh.
Yes?
Doing what?
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
You ll be fine.
Walt, we can t throw her out of the election just because we don t like her speech. That s not what student government s about.
Nowhere. I don t have class until second period.
Just wait outside. Tammy.
Possibly. Please just wait outside.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it s important to be honest. Don t you?
I m the one. I did it. I tore down Paul s posters.
I did it.
This weekend.
I don t know. Yesterday. Sunday.
Door was open.
I don t know. All I know is I did it I
Here?
Oh, come on. You ve had a hard year, you re cooped up with the kid all the time. Let go; live a little.
Should we get a what?
No, I... uh, didn t know that
Still clear?
Take me to that motel. Like you wanted.
Easy, tiger. Come by after school. I ll leave Darryl with the sitter.
You re there.
Sherry... I love you.
It s the only true thing I know anymore.
A mistake? That was no mistake.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it. And maybe go on to...
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Yeah, no, she s a go getter, all right.
Yeah. But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn t it? That s more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
Huh? Oh. Uh... pears
Okay, let s say
I also like bananas.
Paul... Paul.... We ll have plenty of time to get into all this later. A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
No way I It doesn t make sense.
And 290 " disregards, " right?
I m not like you.
What?
So?
I know.
I don t care.
For what?
For what?
It was Tammy I That s who it was.
What do you mean?
No. Uh... I just... you know, I just thought
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there s all different kinds of fruit and... It s nothing against you, Tracy. You re the best. I just thought
Yeah.
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Yeah, you too, Tracy. I m just glad it s over.
Have a great summer. And good luck at college.
Don t you fucking knock?
Paul, get out!
What d I do?
Yeah. Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. Cause, you know, everyone is saying it s so weird that you re running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven t really told me why you re doing it and didn t tell me in advance or anything. But that s okay, you know. l respect your privacy. I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it s you or me, there s no hard feelings. We re still brother and sister. Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
What s it to you?
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
Till 19 fucking 70.
You wanna get me a fuckin snitch jacket?
Merry Christmas yourself, Officer.
Are you sorry she s dead?
No I haven t. Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Yes. But do you know?
That s right. Our motives are selfish, so we re cooperating.
I don t know. I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
Pierce meets people. Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood. This is how they turned out. Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
He s waiting for you to mention mention.
It s Lynn.
Maybe I m just fucking curious.
You fuck for money.
Yeah.
When they deserve it.
I m not sure.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
You look better than Veronica Lake. Now, Pierce Patchett.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
If it s a date I think you d better tell me your first name because I
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother. I guess I got in the way.
He s the opposite of you. He s more like me. Cold, calculating.
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
So tell me about it.
This business, Captain?
He made his play amd he got what he wanted. They re making him a detective.
Call me Dudley.
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner. I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters. Do you hate them, Wendell?
It would ve happened years ago if you hadn t carried him. Why the loyalty, Wendell?
Your partner s through. Department scapegoat on the Chief s orders. He s been billed, he ll be indicted and he ll swing.
Don t underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself. But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
I knew you had juice, but... There s no goddamn bill on me?
Of course... But how?
What work?
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated. But don t stop there. Extrapolate. Imagine the police in control. It s big, lad.
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine. We ll hold a clarification session soon. For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We re going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory. Want to grab a beer?
What? That new mystery girl you ve been seeing?
What are you talking about?
It ll look like justice. That s what that fat fuck got. Justice.
Lynn.
Stensland and Meeks. What were they up to?
Stensland and Buzz Meeks. Two man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants. When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
The Nite Owl! Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
It wasn t the Negroes. The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
They didn t find the shotguns. They planted them.
Let s just kill them.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I ve been trying to be smart. A detective. But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
There are no rules! Why the fuck are you doing this? The Nite Owl made you. You want to tear all that down.
He had help getting up there. Two of his fingers are broken.
At least not anymore.
What about him?
I am. Are you soliciting for police charities? The last time, you people called at my office.
I was here, hosting a party. Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
I don t know him. Mr...
You know I do or you wouldn t be here. How did you find me?
Of course...
Against your code?
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan s murder?
Then you wouldn t feel obligated to report them?
Then listen closely, because I ll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I ll deny it. I run call girls. Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well. I have grown daughters, myself, and I don t like the thought of women being hurt. I sense you share this feeling.
I think she d been hit in the face with a tennis racket. She is was a big doubles fan.
What little studio?
That s why her mother couldn t I. D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
I got her address.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
I m tying up loose ends. Padding my report. You know how it goes.
Anything off. Anything that didn t make sense.
Susan Lefferts.
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
Ear plugs.
It doesn t exactly play like dumb panic.
It s like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
I ll testify, sir. I m not afraid to do what s right.
Clean?
Nothing.
I don t have time. I have
Say what and so what.
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
I never truck with no sissies!
Believed what?
Dogs got no reason to live.
Man, what re you saying?
I don t own no shotguns.
Say what?
I got nothin more to say till I see a judge.
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
I m happy to cooperate. You don t need to tie me down.
But you were business associates?
And?
The youngest applicant by eight years.
Am I...? Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Answer yes or no.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney s working hypothesis...? Yes or no, Edmund.
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance
Then for God s sake, don t be a detective. Stick to assignments where you won t have to make those choices. Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
White s a mindless thug.
Yes, Dudley. I am.
Edmund, you don t want it and you can t have it.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths. Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late model purple Mercury Coupe.
There always are. But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically. A few loose ends don t matter.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes. To Stensland.
Why?
And now you ll provide them.
Why not, lad? Absolute justice?
Two minutes, Dudley. It s important.
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C. O. he ever served under. What about him?
What s this all about, lad?
You re Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
No.
That s right.
Throwing me?
You re the payoff expert. I m just doing my duty.
What about you?
What?
I want you to follow Bud White.
It s not a request. I need to know what White knows. Follow him or I ll have you pulled off Badge of Honor. Permanently.
Yesterday yes, today no. What happened last night?
You make a mistake?
I ain t a priest, Lieutenant. I can t hear your confession.
What?
Rollo was a purse snatcher. My father ran into him off duty. He shot my father six times and got away clean. No one even knew who he was. I made the name up to give him some personality.
I ve given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell s going on?
What s Fleur de Lis?
What?
I m going to Lynn Bracken s. I ll meet you at the Dining Car.
Yeah. The fact that you guys won t let it get filed away.
Bud White s been here?
Is the Veronica Lake look alike one of your whores?
What s her name?
Why s she seeing Bud White?
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
Not good enough.
I know who you are. You re the policeman Bud told me about.
Don t underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
The silver screen s loss is your gain.
I see Bud because I want to. I see Bud because he can t hide the warmth he has inside him.
I don t hate White. I really don t. It s just, in my business, it s the wild cars you have to watch out for.
You cut to the heart of things, don t you? What about Lynn Bracken? She going to be a hooker all her life?
Some reality.
Why not?
You re the first person to ever call me tough.
You, me and White, huh?
I work for Patchett. I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Bisbee, Arizona. The air s good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
Right now, before I back down.
I want D. A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
None. Call it a hunch.
Without what, his smearing yours first? What s he got on you, Loew? Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
The proof had his throat slit. So far you re not denying it.
Is she?
You lost me, Sid. Who?
I need an extra fifty. Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
Stand there with your camera. I ll stop here so you get Grauman s Chinese in the backgrouns.
Sid, it s Vincennes.
Something good?
What about Fleur de Lis? Their slogan s Whatever you desire. '
Sid, how are they hanging?
What s he doing here, Sid?
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
And Reynolds?
Where d you hear that?
Sid, cut the crap. I
What s wrong, Trash?
You didn t get my message? It got called off. The kid chickened out at the last minute.
This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number. Hollywood zero one two three nine.
I just called it.
Something like that.
Pierce isn t like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
You know, when I came out to L. A., this isn t exactly where I saw myself ending up.
And no one ll know about this?
Oh Jesus.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Yes.
Nothing.
Nothing.
He didn t give you an address? He didn t give you a phone number?
Don t know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else
I don t know what that means.
So... how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
Listen to me
Listen
Turn on CNN.
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Clear as day.
When can you get it here?
Come straight here. Don t talk to anyone.
Why?
A direct one.
I don t know who he is.
Told by whom?
Really?
Who was that other guy?
Who are they?
What do they have to do with this?
The NSA?
You re crazy.
Wait.
Yeah.
It s a SAT tracker.
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga Hertz.
230 Giga Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy SAT uplinks.
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
If I knew, they d be after me. Which they probably are right now. Bye.
They re spooks.
Exposure. They can t have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
No shit.
Hey, if you live another week I ll be impressed.
And you won t. Now move
You could knock on the door, you know, and I d open it.
And you were worried about me. That s nice, I appreciate
We said a hundred.
What do you mean?
Look, my wife is understandably
I called my wife!
I didn t use my name.
I called from a payphone!
You told me no calls.
You don t get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin monitor everyone you called in the last
How do you know so much?
You used to work for em, didn t you?
How d you get around the tap orders?
How d you have the manpower to
Jesus.
Why d you leave?
They come after you?
Looks like Detroit.
It really is. Did you find anything?
Yeah.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
What s going on?
Who?
Where?
Here?!
You sure?
Those are Feds.
That wasn t so hard.
Let s not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
We re not gonna hurt you.
Tell him we re not gonna hurt him.
No he won t.
What about newspapers and magazines?
So what do we do now?
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
The area s wired for surveillance, they ll be looking for those moves.
Listen
What if
What if
What if
What if we just fucked with em?
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
No.
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that
Is Jerry Delsano in?
It s Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry s name.
The thing is... it really can t wait.
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if
Wildlife footage, for God s sake. I don t see how he could ve slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
What s your point.
Why?
I didn t want to bother you during your racquetball game.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
The robbery.
Oh... yeah, I didn t see the accident.
A report?
That s cause I wasn t there.
I was in the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
About what?
I m no expert, but I m assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused
What kind of trouble.
I can t.
I m not his attorney.
Because I don t know.
Than why don t you talk to the bus driver?
Somebody took my blender.
No.
No, sir.
Not that I could see.
No.
To buy lingerie.
Yes, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
This guy s a fat assed Rotarian gasbag.
Not a very good one, but
Just for the criminals.
Right.
Something bad happened tonight.
I saw a man die.
In front of Harrison s, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...... he was upset about something and he said... Doesn t matter now. I m gonna wash up.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Honey, I don t like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
No.
Well, you know
How could you let me find out like this?
Robert
" Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars
" At the center of the investigation are well known Washington area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks. "
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She s my connection to an investigator.
I know.
I see her for business.
It s not real... That s not me.
It s not a real picture, Stacy, it s been doctored up.
Stacy
Do you know what I m looking at Robert?
I m looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken yesterday.
Was that doctored up, too?
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn t work. I couldn t buy food.
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts
This is science fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
Yes.
Just reporters.
This is my house. Nobody s kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
What happened to your head?
Well... yeah.
That s okay.
You opened the thing?
That was for Christmas.
What is it?
Albert s gonna get me my job back.
Yeah. I wish you could ve met...
A friend of mine. I don t know his real name. He s dead now.
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co workers.
I don t believe it is, no.
I ve got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very
It s not?
That s not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
You re right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
That s probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I ll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can t
You didn t squeeze DePinto?
Oh.
It tastes like fish.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I ve ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
When do I get to meet him?
Brill.
That wasn t the answer I was hoping for.
It s how he works.
Yes.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill s fee varies with risk. Perhaps you d be more comfortable using someone else.
Other than me.
Someone with whom you don t have quite so personal a
He doesn t work that way.
You re not.
I wouldn t let you. Good luck with DePinto.
Eat your fish.
Why?
You got a minute?
Who s doing this?
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
For the last four years.
You don t work there anymore, Bobby.
Bullshit.
We re screwed.
How?
You have to.
I did care how.
What re you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
I m sorry about that.
It s not me?
We d like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
I m an investigator with Pro Tech Security.
Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to
We believe he did.
We have good reason to believe that he passed you
We d like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you
Otherwise we may have to
We d rather not
Otherwise we may have to
We d rather not
My shoe?
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don t ever mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
Seat 74.
Good point.
L. T., in this office I d prefer you say Italian Americans.
That s because your Union bosses are those Guido mother fuckers.
The Union s trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
Mr. Dean
Where s Stacy?
What are you talking
Why?
Are those my Christmas presents?
Can I open em up?
Really?
Dad!
Where s mom?
Do I know you?
Having an adventure. I can t tell you about it right now, but I ll tell you about it soon.
No. We re never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Men don t win fights with women, son, I ll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I ve got a question for you, and it s incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get Out Of Jail Free card. Ready?
Alright!
Did they take your clothes?
You ve got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn t take em?
Usually they take clothes.
What about jewelry?
The blender?
They didn t take the silverware?
Sounds like they didn t want anything that wasn t electric?
They only took electrical appliances.
Table 122?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
Into what?
I m a labor lawyer. There are always mob ties.
Christ!
Bobby
Bobby
Calm down.
Rachel s dead?
Jesus.
Bobby
Why would they
Why would the NSA
You re tired.
Listen to me.
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
To the cops?
Bobby, you re in way over your head.
I have a family.
Yeah?
Jerry?
Bobby
Yeah.
I need help.
How can I reach you?
Are you still in Crystal City?
The police?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
He got hit by a bus.
You would?
Why not?
It s hard to say for certain, these things are
Yes sir.
Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could ve downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
What the hell does it mean?
You didn t ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
Fuck you.
I said fuck you.
You re gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? Terrorism, you unconscionable asshole?
He s dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
We found the originals.
There was a transfer.
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we ve ID d as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney. Mr. Reynolds? Sir?
Hiding something?
He had help.
He s clever. He had help.
Sir
I just meant
We believe?
Lyle?!
You re kidding me.
Dean s with Lyle.
So they know everything.
Oh, let s assume that they have.
We don t know.
What about the tape?
Do you have visual?
What s your ETA?
The fuck do you have goin on with Sam Albert?
You have any idea what kind of position this
Puffed cheese?
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with
No.
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
Hello! Good morning.
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Excuse me?
I don t want to go back.
I don t care to bargain.
I don t believe that. I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You re a foreigner too, aren t you, here, in this market?
Excuse me?
I was concerned. As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
As the wife of one of our party.
What do you mean, poetry?
Sounds perfectly clear. Where does the Ostrich come in?
He said be careful.
Pardon?
I do not.
I thought you might paste them into your book.
I d like you to have them.
I m quite all right, thank you.
See what s happening to them the stars.
No.
Yes. Absolutely.
Fiction. We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on. More.
Of course. Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
And the marriage is that a fiction?
No.
Mrs. Clifton Katharine turns, disgusted.
Good.
You don t sew at all!
Now.
Now.
Marmite addicted! Baths not with other people! Islands. Your handwriting. I could go on all day. My husband. Alm  sy nods.
A lie. What do you hate most?
What? No!
No.
This is empty, just coming!
It s a folk song.
No, no, it s Hungarian. My daijka sang it to me.
This is a different world is what I tell myself. A different life. And here I am a different wife.
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Shall we be all right?
What?
Would you let me pass?
Don t do this.
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
No.
We ve got to get you out of here.
What?
Don t talk.
I know. I m sorry. I ll make a fire. I ll be back.
Yes. Absolutely.
Thank you. Will you bury Geoffrey? I know he s dead.
I know.
You too. Good luck!
Appropriate?
Are you mad? Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
I ve known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife. I think I d know what is and what isn t too much for her. I think she s know herself.
What?
Sorry, what s your point?
Could I trouble you for some water?
I desperately need a jeep. There s been an accident.
No, I m not thinking clearly I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle? I ll pay, of course and some morphine and  Seventy miles I can be back here by dusk.
What?
Am I not talking sense? forgive me, I m, I ve been walking, I ve there s a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers. I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
Count Laszlo de Alm  sy. The Officer is writing this down. A glance at his Corporal.
Look, listen to me. A woman is dying my wife! is dying seventy miles from here. I have been walking for three days! I don t want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
Looking for the fossils. Why should we wait until we re in London? This girl was probably twelve years old.
Her hands and feet were tied.
I looked at them. They re shrubs, small trees. Exquisite. And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
Try to get a second radiator, we ll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
No, because you can t see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple! Look! What is that? Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility 
In my room.
What s the matter with you?
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears. In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Right.
I told you so.
Yes. It was. Thanks for the compass. I ll look after it for you.
Tomorrow afternoon. Don t worry. I ll be ready.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
Shut up!
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I ll give you a fucking good hiding.
Okay.
Just kiss me. It would mean such a lot to me.
Darling, for goodness sake!
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose I shall, of course, be bereft 
I m fine. I got hot.
I m not pregnant. I m hot. I m too hot.
Aren t you?
Can t we really go home? I can t breathe. Aren t you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn t you die to feel rain on your face? It s Christmas and it s all I don t know if you asked me I d go home tomorrow. If you wanted.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
What?
Isn t it? Wedding present from Katharine s parents. I m calling it Rupert Bear. Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.
Apprentices.
Oh no, really. She has her book.
To arm twisting.
I m not sewing anything else.
No!
The Germans were here. The Germans were all over this area. They left mines everywhere. Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
Is something funny?
I ve met you before.
The mines, the wires, there s a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
There s a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance. I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
You get Hardy.
I promise you that was the right thing to do. He s my good luck. Now cut. This one. I hope we don t die.
I m not scared. So many people have died around me. But I would be a shame for us. I don t feel like being shy.
Actually, you can t cut, can you? You ll fall over. Give me the pliers.
Kiss me. Before I cut. Just in case.
I try not to expect you.
Then I d think there must be a reason.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling s cannon Zamzammah remember? That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge. It s red hot.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
Of course. When?
Kip  I
Is that what you think? Is that what you think I think?
I ll always go back to that church.
It s not over everywhere. I didn t mean literally.
I need morphine. A lot. And a pistol.
He can t even move.
No. He s no.
Hello miss.
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others
I ll ask the Lieutenant. But thank you.
He s sleeping.
I ll tell him. What is it? Is it a mine?
Does he have to go?
I d like to spend a night with you in a bed.
A bit of one.
I had a hotel room.
Go away.
How awful. What will you do?
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
Through a window.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma s scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
You got a better idea?
Why didn t I think of that?
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I m Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can t exactly use my cell phone.
We re getting close.
I don t know, but close.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
Look, trust me. I know what I m doing.
I m in the middle.
He s on to something bigger.
Too late now.
Who am I?
Uh. I m showing off.
No you can t.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows? Check, please.
Then don t.
Uh, yes.
I ll call an ambulance.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that s what Roki says.
Of course you wouldn t. The Rembrandt wouldn t fit.
So what?
You... you can t.
No. Why would I be?
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
Well, no... but...
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
Roki has a vivid imagination.
You can t.
Possibly.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
Give him the card.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Not bad. I didn t expect you to make it out.
I m a thief. Sue me.
What s your problem? I m doing the job.
I m just curious what sort of security system you d have in your own house.
I m impressed. Can t spot a thing.
Good morning.
As I recall, you ve robbed it before.
They re having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
We re doing this together. We re partners.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You ve got one.
A lifelong problem, I m afraid.
That s because I wanted them to!
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
No one needs anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
We get the Mask I ll tell you.
Without the Mask it doesn t matter.
Our equipment has arrived.
Twenty four seconds as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
A dozen times.
Charged?
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn t talk, just stood there shivering... like this.
Terrified. Still am.
I had a lifeline. If I ve got a lifeline, I m okay.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Bookshelf. Sensors
It s a party.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven t changed.
Yes. Yes.
It s your mistake.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy
Sure, it s only worth 25 million or so, don t bother telling me what you re going to do with it.
Okay, look, I m delivering this to a man who s going to give us the key to our job. But it s pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don t have any more secrets.
Transfer.
And the money goes
But those instructions, they re recorded in the computer.
A parting gift from the Empire.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that s stumping me.
That s the beauty of it. There s only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
There s no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I ve planned it all. There aren t any surprises.
I ve covered everything. And you re the best, so
Look, there s a video security system to bypass, that s the only hard part. You ve done that a dozen times.
Can t be too careful.
Charged.
Can t break tradition. It s bad luck.
It was wrong to deceive you.
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
Oh, I don t care about the money.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
They drive so recklessly there.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
The disc is still in there.
No way.
But
You gave them the eight billion.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you ve done goes to the PRC.
Oh, hell. I m dyslexic.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it s a more than fair price.
I understand they ve had a bad run of luck, health wise, and they have my sympathies. But that s not PG  E s fault.
Wait a minute I thought we were negotiating here.
Oh, Jesus. Who s responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
Carlos isn t a friend; he s a client.
Erin Brockovich. Car accident. Not her fault, she says. And she looks like such an honest girl, don t you think?
It s those files you asked for.
All of em?
It s an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
She must be a tough cookie, cause it s a pretty advanced case. I d say she s been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
Usually, in adults, it s from exposure to bacteria or a virus or...
Yes?
You re a lawyer?
Right.
Yeah, I m real sorry to hear that.
I ll say. Holy moley.
Right, but I m sorry, I don t see why you were corresponding with PG  E about it in the first place.
They did?
Wow. Why would they do that?
The what?
It s a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
It was right up on the PG  E property over there.
Yeah.
For what?
A number for the whole group, or for us?
And he s making them give five million of it to you all.
Any school you want.
Yup.
... couldn t take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen. Just wanna take good care of my kids. You know?
If you hadn t used profanity
I told you the questions might get a little personal
You did? Wow, sorry about that. Listen, Mario s a little not so bright. He seems to think that you said
You said things would be fine, and they re not.
I was wondering could you tell me who I d talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck? Just for the weekend.
I don t wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Where s Anna?
Yeah. I got it. No problem.
Excuse me?
I left a message. I ve been dealing with that real estate thing. I was gonna write up a whole damn report and
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is. 05 parts per million. And that at the rate you mentioned,. 58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
Look, I m sorry. You were gone. I just assumed you were off having fun.
I don t know. Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
They told her something, but it can t have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn t think her water was bad.
It doesn t take a genius to look at those medical records and think something s wrong.
The ones in the box of files. The box of files? The one from your office?
Course I did.
Ten. There s a lot of other places I could work.
So far. But that place is a pig sty. I wouldn t be surprised if there s more.
So you think we got em scared?
That wasn t an offer. A million would ve been an offer. When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it s a fuck you.
Because they can. You heard that kid they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal. They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
Erin
That s crazy why not?
It s not about working hard
It s about being realistic. Something like this, Erin it could take forever. They re a huge corporation. They d completely bury us in paperwork. I m just one guy with a shitty little P. I. firm.
Oh, you do? With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
Four more. Eleven people. So far.
Kinda like David and what s his name?
And that s what caused the contamination?
They skipped that step.
No shit.
Yeah? Then gimme another raise.
We ve got the PG  E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls. But nobody s getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG  E fuckers in San Francisco.
PG  E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
Really? It makes me sick.
You didn t care about my case?
From their tone of voice on the phone, I d say they re taking us more seriously.
D you get his name? Course not. Jesus, Ed
What? Who?
I don t know. Big. Dark.
No, Ed what with me running for my life, I didn t have time to check those things
I m sorry, I m gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here Do you mind?
It s my paycheck. Which I earned. Which I deserve. Which I shouldn t have to beg for. That fat ass bitch won t give it to me.
Fuck you. Make time. Cause I bust my ass for you. I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you. And what do you do for me? Huh? You see the way I m treated around here but have you ever stood up for me once? Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I m doing? Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn t get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she s the best God damn employee I ve ever had?
Things like the head counsel for PG  E calling me with an offer. 20 million, plus attorney s fees. Take it or leave it.
It s about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
I m thinking... I wish someone else had to make this decision. 50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever. But...
And it s less than pocket change for PG  E.
Maybe. but maybe not. We still don t have anything linking this to PG  E corporate. Plus, there s the statute problem. Plus, we re way short on manpower, so we d need to bring on more lawyers...
Bullshit. It was a misunderstanding. But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect
Not in my world.
Erin, it s just a meeting.
Look, you said you weren t feeling great. I thought you should rest.
Okay, look. It s an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers
And, what, I m not serious?
" Fun? " Jesus, " fun? " I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as " fun? "
No one s taking anything
I m not gonna fire you. I wanted to. But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit. You embarrassed me, Erin.
Uh huh.
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I d say we ll end up on the lower end of that. Still a lot of money.
Because. They know the evidence; they know they re gonna lose a jury trial. Maybe they wouldn t lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they d spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of
Five years, maybe, for a trial. Double that for the appeal.
Hey, that s not so bad. Compare it to the Love Canal that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven t seen a dime. So in legal terms, ten years is
I know. We re having a meeting, it s all set up
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
You re not gonna be there.
This isn t doctor s orders. It s mine. I m saying you can t come.
Because Kurt doesn t want to work with you. He thinks you re a loose cannon.
Erin
Erin? What are you
Say you were wrong.
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
Say you d be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn t up and quit over all this.
How do you know that?
You see your office?
Oh, okay. Here it comes.
The extortion, the threats...
" I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that ll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera... "
Corey.
Right.
Did he say why?
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
And...?
What do you mean?
Thank you very much. Aren t you a gentleman? Mr....
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
I guess I did.
I wish I knew. It s for my boss. He s fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places. The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself. Would that be okay?
Nope. Maiden.
I don t know what you re talking about.
There s more than one kind?
Harmful, like how? What would you get?
Oh, yeah. Definitely. Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic. Bad, bad stuff.
Have you been to the water board?
Every county has one. They keep records of anything water related within their jurisdiction. You should be able to find something there.
Oh, come on, where s your sense of adventure? We re going someplace you never been before.
It happens all the time.
I don t know.
I m a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word " dog " and see " god ".
Some meeting. With PG  E people.
We ll see.
You always say that. Then you go to work and forget you promised.
You never fall short for the work people. I guess maybe you just love them more.
No offense. There are just some things we need that you probably didn t know to ask.
Erin. You don t even have phone numbers for some of them.
Everyone s. This is a lawsuit. We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
What the hell do you think you re doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we ll get along fine.
I do.
You got more than one?
Ten?
You got a little girl?
C mon. I bought em for you, to make up for that night.
Why not?
How?
I was serious before, you know. If you need someone to keep an eye on them after school or something I don t have a job now, so I m around in the afternoons.
I m not a deadbeat. I work when I need to.
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that s a real nice offer, I don t mind taking you up on it.
Cause I like kids. I like hanging out with them.
Thanks for reminding me.
It s a simple thing. Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
What? But you been working so hard
Well, I m sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be. I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid out and perfect. I mean, hell I was Miss Wichita, for God s sakes. Did I tell you that? You live next door to a real live beauty queen. I still got the tiara. I kept it cause I thought it meant something. I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life. I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
No I m not. Look at me. I m not.
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is... something else.
I m just saying
Come on, Erin. A job s supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
Nothing.
I didn t say that.
Keep your voice down.
What do you want, a joke?
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here. Beth started talking.
Lock the door.
That is not what I m
Thinking.
What s that?
I m sorry. I m just working so hard
I can t leave my job, George.
I can t. Look this job it s the best thing that ever happened to me. I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me. Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say. I never had that. Ever. Don t ask me to give it up. I need it.
Hi. It s me. I got a favor to ask you.
That s okay. I understand.
Jaguar s a darn pretty car.
Nice to see you, Erin. We ve missed you.
What s going on?
Yes. It s called accountability.
Have you been logging on?
I moved payroll onto the computer. It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
Uh huh?
Yes?
Is this a joke? Did Baxter put you up to this?
No one put me up to anything. I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Right, I guess those are the kids
Their parents, I m pretty sure.
The Emperor?
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Much anger in him, like in his father.
The boy is our last hope.
I m cold... so cold...
Ben... Ben...
But Han and Leia will surely die.
I can help them!
I feel The Force.
And that is why I must go.
You won t.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Barks and growls at his boss.
Looking? Looking? You ve found someone I d say. Heh? Yes!
Help you I can... yes... yes.
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we ve got things to do.
I m not looking for a friend. I m looking for a Jedi Master.
You know the Jedi Master?
Patience. It s time to eat.
It s the Jedi s time to eat, too.
Not far, not far. Be patient. Soon you will see him. Why wish you become a Jedi?
Oh, your father... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
The son of Skywalker. You must destroy him... or he will be our undoing.
You are weak! I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
Yes... yes. That would be a great asset.
There isn t a hint of life in the area. But all the perimeter markers are set, so you ll know if anyone comes calling.
He s checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He ll be in soon.
You re an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
Wait. I ll send a patrol with you.
What is it?
I shut it off. What s her royal holiness want?
I do hope he s all there... if you take my meaning. I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit...
Sit down, and shut up!
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para light system seems to be damaged.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
Does Luke know?
Han, we need you here.
Yes.
Me? I don t know what you mean.
And what are they, pray tell?
I d just as soon kiss a wookiee.
We are fighting for a cause much...
And you think you re the one to apply some heat?
What was it?
An Imperial probe droid.
This baby s got a few surprises left in her.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
Probably an asteroid field....
To get killed... you re not seriously going into an asteroid field?
I take it back.
I m against that.
Now you re making sense.
What is it?
Very funny. You can let go now.... I m getting angry.
How do I look?
Well, I hope you don t expect more.
They re just trying to see if they can stir something up... we re safe.
Yes, you do.
Sure, they re safer. You always know what they re going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
You mean a man you can control.
Where?
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we re taking off!
No lightspeed?
Oh, so sorry! Didn t mean to offend your droid. You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
Then we have to find a safe port around here. Got any ideas?
You keep logs? My, how organized.
Never heard of that system.
A mining colony.
Can you trust him?
Who s staring?
You look great.
Something s wrong here. Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don t trust him.
I m worried about all of us. I can t figure out what they re up to.
I ve finished my circle and I haven t picked up any life read ings.
Thanks to you.
No hard feelings?
I always said you were a gentleman.
Repairs...
Hyperdrive.
Not as well as I d like. We re a small outpost and not very self sufficient. I ve had supply problems of every kind and... What s so funny?
Shut up a minute and listen. I m doing what I can to make this easier for you.
He doesn t want you at all. He s after someone named Skywalker.
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you re being treated unfairly.
Take them, but I m keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
Not really.
Thanks.
You re part of the mining guild then?
I m coming over to your side, that s what. And I have a feeling I m making a big mistake.
We have no use for your kind.
You ve probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
Luke!
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
I m fine. Really. Leia... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad... well, it made me think about things.
I have this... feeling. I m not sure, really...
What are you talking about?
He wants to pay off that criminal he s in hock to.
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
Why not me?
I thought I was in good shape.
No! No different! The differences are in your mind. Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
They re a lot stronger than I m used to.
But I feel The Force flowing!
The dark side beckons. But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Consume you it will... as it did Obi wan s apprentice.
No, no. Easier, quicker, more seductive.
You will know. When you are at peace... calm... passive. A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense. Never for attack.
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force. A servant of evil it is. Into it you must go.
Free your mind and return he will.
Control, control you must learn of what you see. Not easy, not fast.
Bespin. I see it too... Friends you have there, heh? Concentrate and see them you will.
You ll find I m full of surprises.
No!
I ll die first.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
Yes, sir. We re in luck. The sick bay s almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public. They ll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it s available on the spot. And the experts can start giving them the once over first thing in the morning. General Brody s very pleased.
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
They re... pretending to dress.
My name is Cornelius. And this is Zira my wife.
Believe what?
But we saw Earth destroyed.
Dr. Milo, please don t call my wife mad.
And we can watch...
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
No clothes. Stevie, they changed into them.
They look pretty docile.
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
I should. I ve been doing it half my life to Humans.
Please
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off not an army, not a man.
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers everything is pumped into the island from the south.
Don t lie to me.
I see your point. What s the favor?
Dream on, blue eye.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
Can you land?
What s the little black box do?
And I don t need to know. So fuck you, I m goin to Hollywood.
So what s the deal, huh? Go into L. A., find the President s daughter, secure the box, and bring em both out and I m free?
Having second thoughts?
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let s just say it s the ultimate defensive weapon.
So what does this thing do?
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia s tracer there. Once you go inside, you re on your own. You know what you have to do with the girl, don t you? We have to spare this nation her trial for treason.
Let s just say it s what s best for the country.
A medical team will be standing by.
No.
Lock fuel rods.
I m here.
You re gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you re married, no guns, no foul language. It s a brand new day for you, Snake.
Does he know how to activate it?
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Where s... Cuervo Jones...?
Where?
Who?
Are you crazy?
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again. Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
Oh no, it s the Doctor.
You need help.
What the hell is this?
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
Find Cuervo Jones.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
You re running out of time.
I m looking for somebody.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
I cannot
Move aside. This is the King s road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
That is a wild boast. You lack a knight s humility.
Move aside!
So be it, to the death.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together
Don t recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana s sorcery.
Of Merlin?
But not from your destiny.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can t lose him.
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
In the great book.
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks... Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana
Rise, Mordred.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
You freed it, son?
Ye...
And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
I m going.
Don t start a war on my wedding day!
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man s life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
You, my lord.
Because you and the land are one.
No.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
There is one.
You.
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
I will run.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
I m not jealous!
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
I am the desert, where water disappears
What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
I?
To kill and be king, is that all?
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
Why it s perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don t want the building torn down.
Well what s wrong?
Shall we summon the writer? He s in Paris I believe.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
What s he doing there? Teaching?
Don t you think he s too old, though? How s his health?
I didn t know that.
I don t know. No, not really I suppose. But I ve made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
Yes.
I see, your excellency.
Hi, how d your day go?
Oh great, anything else?
What s this?
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Maybe the circuit is busy?
What didn t he tell you?
Burke.
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
What is it?
Me too.
No, she was heavily sedated.
Yes, I m affraid it is.
We still don t know.
No. Not at all,
Not that I know of.
I really wouldn t know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Want to ask him?
Look, he wouldn t have any reason to be up there in the first place.
When she s well enough, I ll ask.
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we ve got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
Yes, I go now.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don t do that.
She is going to be well?
What!
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
Fine thank you.
Why the math?
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Stimulant? She s higher than a kite right now!
Depression?
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
And those lies she s been telling?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Never.
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
You re kidding! Like what?
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Convulsion?
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It s a kind of seizure disorder.
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn t rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Well of course I m sure. I d tell you. Christ, I don t even smoke grass.
No. I m building a new house, the old one s been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d you ask?
Please go away.
That s okay. I should ve told you I wouldn t be in uniform.
It s the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
Yes am.
Pretty close.
Sure did.
No I didn t know you had one.
No.
He didn t mention her.
That depends.
The priest.
If he came to me for spritual help, I d say no.
No I wouldn t. But I d try to persuade him to turn himself in.
I beg your pardon?
Well, the first thing I d do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
Well it just doesn t happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I ve never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Why, I don t understand?
But how?
You could do it yourself...
Could you see her?
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She s already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you re gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won t somebody help her!
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
Like what?
What else?
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
No.
Yes I did, I m sorry.
Not at all. Why d you ask?
Please.
Are you sure?
In Europe.
No
What s the difference?
What?
Um........ Stuff.
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
Oh............
When can I have one?
You like it?
I found it.
Yeah.
No you don t. I do it all the time.
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Captain Howdy.
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
He s nice.
Well, maybe he s sleeping.
Cause I like it.
I wouldn t talk.
I don t know
Okay. And tomorrow night, I ll take you to a movie, okay?
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Well you know it s okay.
You like him.
Your not gonna marry him are you?
What?
But you like him.
Do you not like him like daddy?
Well I heard differently.
I don t know, I just thought.
How do you know?
Why does God let us get tired?
My bed was shaking, I can t get to sleep.
So something please Doctor, Help her!
Honey this is Father Dyer.
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She s convinced
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
The Lord be with you.
Amen
And let my cry come unto thee.
Her heart.
What s this about?
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
I ve seen him.
Only what I read in the papers.
I once did a paper on it
From the psychiatric end.
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
Yeah, a fall.
Couldn t it of happened on the fall.
Unlikely.
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Sick priest, is that it?
I don t know anyone who fits the description.
No I probably wouldn t.
Is that a threat?
Very much.
That s to bad.
Who s in it?
I ve seen it.
Come on!
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Yes?
Do you have an appointment?
Are you a relative?
You re not going to drive.
You re not going to drive!
It s our goddamn car!
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Little slow tonight.
Your pay.
Take it now.
Look, Frankie. You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
Right, twelve years. Couple times a month.
So maybe it s time we took a vacation from each other.
Swimming trunks.
Too bad. You could use some sun. Really.
We have some lotion.
You believe this? The kid won t come out. I m playing Camptown Races for him and the next thing I know he s locked himself in the bathroom. There s nothing sharp in there, is there?
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
No.
Two at a time?
Oh.
Accident?
Get your hand off me.
Go fuck yourself.
Out.
How we doing?
Am I late?
What s the point?
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Frank.
Frank. I m here. I always get here. Don t sweat it.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Lotta water.
Huh?
Jack...
Fuck him.
Fuck him.
I hate your kids, Frank.
Only by relation. Besides, they hate me, too.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one...
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
You got weird kids, Frank.
Bosen black. Flat.
Trust me, you re not missing anything.
Thanks.
Only on odd days.
Why the interest?
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
Funny. Strike a bell?
No thanks.
So do I.
No, you gotta go cause if you don t get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won t feel guilty, so I don t gotta go.
I don t gotta go.
Says who?
You re thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might ve meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don t cut too deep anymore.
What do you mean?
It s me.
Yeah. Listen... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
It s not family. It s business.
We don t get a gig.
Your doorbell doesn t work.
What?
Terrific.
I don t know what you mean.
I told you. Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
It wasn t like that.
No.
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There s no shame in it.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
Talk.
It s just an idea. I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I d be entitled to the extra. Isn t that what we agreed?
If you re unhappy with the arrangement
If you d like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I d be glad
I ve tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
You, Frank. All these years you been telling me we re different. We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
What?
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
Let s get it over with.
I just thought we should talk about it. Between ourselves.
I don t know... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don t think she s right for the act.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
I ll drop the eighths.
It s early.
She ll get here.
Yeah, well, Your s isn t. Let me run a comb though it.
Come on, stand still.
It s not gonna hurt you.
You re a fucking alarm clock.
How about these?
Yeah. Something.
Yeah, fine.
You recognized me.
So what do you think?
Thanks, but I ve got plans.
First night?
Last?
We do. She s got hers, we ve got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
It was April. April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Pearls. White gown. Beautiful.
Okay.
Right.
No, you take the right.
Okay.
Good idea.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. You mind?
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is
No, that s your problem, Frank. You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three year old.
Christ, can t you hear it?
Doesn t it matter to you?
Because I can hear it.
Right. I love you, Frank.
I m sorry, Frank. All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
What s it look like I m doing? I m tuning a goddamn piano.
Fine.
Half hour. Once I finish this octave I m gonna get breakfast. You see what s on the buffet?
Two hours ago!
No. Why?
She s a big girl.
What the hell are these?
What?
Huh?
What are you talking about?
He was wearing a suit.
How come I didn t hear anything?
Celebrating. Join me?
Right. The Royal. When s the last time we were there?
February?
Right. It s incredible how you do that. Remember things.
Not for me. I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that? Otherwise, I forget. I just forget. But you. You never forget. Ever. So how come you couldn t remember Ma s birthday?
Yeah.
You always threw up.
He was just having fun.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
You could ve come.
You re making things up, Frank.
The tenth s out.
I can t make the tenth.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
Just until we find another girl.
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie? We re in for three weeks solid, Jack.
No.
I told you, Jack. It s a telethon. No one gets a cent.
I don t know. Some disease.
I don t know.
It s a disease, Jack. We re against it. It s not a moral decision.
Seventy one
Are you kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me?
We re playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
Look. I didn t know when we were going to be on until yesterday. What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
I m sorry. I should ve checked it out. I screwed up. But that doesn t mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
No, let s stay on it. I m sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig. He left a wife and two sons. He wasn t a hero. He was a fool.
That s right. I wasn t there. I don t have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
What re you doing?
Oh. Yeah. It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
I set it for Wednesday. The ceremony. They re doing the stone today. It s okay? Wednesday?
There s not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all...
No.
No, it s not that. I... can t drink from the bottle. I... gag.
I ll take the Mallory.
Oh. Fine. It was nothing. Couple sore knuckles. Nothing.
Yeah, I know. Me, too.
Yeah?
Five years ago. November.
Daughter s. Sweet sixteen.
She asked for it.
The flu.
Look, Nick. You want us to pack up, we ll pack up.
I m sorry?
Blanche.
Well, that s fine
Right.
Uh huh. Well, Miss Moran, what is it you d like to do for us?
Yes, it is.
This is where the auditions were.
We re finished.
My watch is broken, too.
Look, miss. We re tired, you have gum on your lip, and we re going home.
Don t take it personally.
You re an hour and a half late.
We ran long.
Miss
Okay. I think that s all we need to know.
When we know.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
We re a team. We work together.
Where s my name?
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
Changed?
What s he talking about?
Do I look like I m naked?
What s wrong with it?
Hey!
Just look. What do you wear? A nine?
My wife wears a seven. You don t look like a seven to me.
Okay, okay. Here, how about this?
All right, but make it quick. Shoes! What size do you wear?
Nine?
Uh... good.
They re nines.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Don t worry. We ll take it out of your share.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can t tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It s like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams...
I said I was sorry.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn t do it. Besides, I don t think they were too offended, do you?
Hey!
I was gonna split it with you guys.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Baker s unabridged.
Virgins.
Okay. The Fantasy Inn.
Smells like fish.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Great.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
People. You think Streisand, right? Hot that night. Chills. Through the whole audience. I could hardly play.
They must ve bought the same map we did.
Huh?
Oh. Yeah. I gotta bunch of them.
You want to tell me what the hell s going on?
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
In case you ve forgotten, we re being paid to be here. So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
Huh?
What?
What re you talking about? They love it.
Susie. It s one more show. One more time. That s all.
Thanks, Lloyd.
I ll call you.
Born and bred.
Gotta go.
Funny job.
Shit, thank God. You look like a creep.
Baker. Jack Baker.
He doesn t bite.
Baker.
Regular hours are eight to five.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
Yeah.
The name s Baker
Black. Labrador.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we ve needed a gig he s come through.
His kid s sick.
The Stratford.
Huh?
Hey. You feel like a cup of coffee?
Hey, listen. You re not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you re not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I m some kinda princess when I burp.
I mean, that d be too creepy. With us working together and all.
Every year.
Every year.
It s okay. Last one.
In and out.
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
Like a baby. You?
Guess I got a little scattered.
Nothing.
Nothing.
I m not upset.
Look. You don t know good. All right?
It means you wouldn t know good if it came up and fucked you.
Let s make a deal. You shut up.
How do you know?
Who s Nina?
Friend? What s she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
Must ve been a cheap date.
Soap?
Huh?
He called her.
Long story.
Nervous?
You re kidding.
So, what happened?
Wow. But I still don t see how...
Coffee?
Look, if you want to leave...
Yeah. Got my own sign.
We outgrew each other.
You don t pick your brother.
So how s the cat food business?
Huh?
Hi.
I didn t want to wake you.
Thanks. For letting me in last night.
Losing his teeth.
Another five years, huh?
It ain t always a blessing. My brother here?
Sounds big. What s he do?
What happened to the donut king?
Is that what you used to do?
What are they?
Oh. Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
I guess it s getting serious.
Looks old.
Why not?
What s a prom?
Okay. How d yours go?
Yeah?
Sure.
Not unless you re sent to the " Clinic. "
Yeah, real fine. Especially all the casualties.
... Thanks.
Jon, he s hooked up to a full spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten
Drive.
My place.
Like I had a choice with that anal retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing. At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post it.
How old is he?
Yes. Pollux bought one along with the original batch. Obviously, he found a way to make more.
He s your brother, you figure it out. Maybe he made another bomb.
You re not my brother. The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer. At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested. How could you forget that?
A few blanks? Like what?
After that. You promised you d always take care of me.
What s worse than losing five million bucks?
For what?
Everything I say is wrong. I can t talk to her anymore.
Is that what you think?
We need to talk.
It s important.
Something good?
Must ve been after we got engaged.
So you had a nightmare.
Were you there to catch me?
How come?
One last time. It s important...
I can t tell you... except only I can do it.
Never mind that! Just take Jamie and get out of that house. Don t tell anyone where you re going especially not him just GO.
Think about it, Eve! Everything he s done recently has been peculiar, right? He s said and done things your husband would never do...
Why point it at me? I m the real thing.
What more proof do you need?
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor s not wasting any time.
He s going to kill off our bureau chiefs one by one.
Jon, what is it?
Can t we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
Jon, if I m not there, he will be tipped off. I ll get rid of Jamie but you and I are in this together.
No life signs at all. He s a turnip.
Would it?
Apparently, fine. He s coming into work. That s the good news...
She doesn t know and she never will.
Don t worry. I ve done my homework. I ll get Pollux to talk.
You re under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent
Mention my family once more and you re dead.
You can tell me all about it from your prison cell.
Not anymore.
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK. And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are. Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
Pollux is what?
Walton, you have to let me see the warden
What makes you so sure this guy s gonna set up his own brother?
What s the matter with your voice, Commander?
I won t tell mom if you don t.
You haven t changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me and you side with him!
You mean like... condoms?
Well, I saw you Kim.
That s your name, isn t it?
Get rid of them.
What happened?
Where should I be? Where s everyone else?
What?
No the best part is, since it s a government job they can t fire you! But how can you be sure you ll get the appointment?
You re supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
Most of the current chiefs they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
A lot of people think you re a snitch. It s dangerous...
You ve made us look pretty good in the past week. And the way you handled the press
D. C. s very high on giving you the promotion. There s just one problem.
Me. I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
Done. In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
What is it, Admiral? I m under the gun here.
No. Most of them are in transit by now. I m heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
What do you know about it?
It didn t work out as planned. Where are you off to?
The hospital? Oh, that s right you re a doctor. Ha ha.
Don t I usually kiss my wife?
Wouldn t be the first time or would it?
Gone?
I m not going anywhere.
I m replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job just like you wanted.
Jon, it s the tenth. I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
The world can wait, Jon. You re going.
Great.
Oh, that Karl.
I disagree. You think I ve been acting strange. Like a completely different person.
Back then who wasn t?
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
You? Married?
Excuse me?
So you left her? Just like that?
Stop Jack, I m getting all weepy.
No?! You almost married this woman. Aren t you even curious what she wants?
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody  s here.
I don t want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited. I want my gift to be the first one you open this year. You know why?
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
A broker? Really. And now you  re in the tire business?
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
I  m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
What about me?
I don  t think you  re hearing me.
What  s going on here?
But I think I like you better this way...
Mary Janes, Mom. You promised.
Where  s my real dad?
Who did?
On a case by case basis...
I think I could figure it out.
Five thirty. Okay.
Got it. Good tip.
Big Ed  s.
Like what?
Don  t you think that  s a little gimmicky?
That  s good but... you did forget the anniversary.
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Is it...?
I don  t think so.
Hey, I  m doing the best I can... I  d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
She wants to have an affair with me.
Pretty much.
So could you write down her exact address?
It wouldn  t really be cheating... It  s complicated.
I  m telling you, those rules don  t apply to me, Arn.
Hey, is that really necessary?
It  s me, Jack...
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie. Please...
We bowl together. We  re bowlers... we won a championship... we  re winners.
Yes... Jack Campbell...
Yes, that  s it... yes, we went to high school together.
What the hell are you talking about? What  s he talking about?
No.
There s no way I was gonna die in that deli... Let s just say I ve been on a lucky streak lately.
Me?
I ve got everything I need.
You still think this is about me, don t you?
That  s my car! You stole my car!
What?!
Brought what on myself?! I didn  t do anything!
Give me my goddamn life back!
I glimpse? A glimpse of what!? What glimpse?! Glimpse!
How much time?!
Why not?
Ticket bad. You draw in lines with pencil.
You first generation, xenophobic, money theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
It  s lovely...
I don  t think so, thank you...
Very funny. I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Need a nurse?
Are we what, Jack?
It would help me if we were.
Frank. Where  s Alan Mintz? Is he here yet?
Look, I don  t know what  s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
Uh... sure Jack... Right back there...
No, I didn  t... that  s great.
Uh huh...
If you  re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
All in one tape?
About the plane? What do you think it  s gonna crash? Don  t say that...
You mean don  t go at all? What about my internship?
For us, Kate.
No, you  re right. What are we doing?
I was in the city.
Because that  s where I live.
Party? Oh no, I can  t go to a party...
Telling my mother she doesn  t have to stay with the kids.
You  re kidding me...
No, she  s not.
But it  s twenty degrees outside...
... my feet are hurtin ...
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
It  s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you  re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don  t have time for wining and dining.
No, I  m serious... you  re really stunning...
Do what?
She got those shoes...
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Really.
Surprise. We  re pregnant... Yeah... that must  ve been... I mean that was very unexpected. But what are you gonna do, right?
Sure. I really like Annie.
No, I love Annie. We had a lot of good times, didn  t we?
Charles Street? In the Village? When we were living in Greenwich Village...? Great times. Why  d we ever leave?
You had a heart attack?
If you want to look at it that way...
What...?
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Nice, Jack. You  re sweeping me off my feet.
What are you talking about? You never wait all day. You can barely wait until it  s light out.
What  s the difference? I  m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
Okay...
Worse, you mean...
And now...?
But you always seem so certain.
That  s a big one for me, too.
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
I guess... some of them are probably faking.
I  m out of the doghouse?
Think bigger.
A perk for what?
I don  t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey. We  ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
I  m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
This is New York City, it  s like the needy people capital of the world. Those Jersey clients of yours aren  t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
No, this is the center of the universe. If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else? Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
But I  ve done some good things too, haven  t I?
Are you okay, Jack?
Promise me again...
I  m moving to Paris... it was right here... It  s a box marked  Jack.  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I  m going to be heading it up.
That  s the one...
Not with what they pay me...
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Jesus, Jack...
Jack.
That s because I m a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
That ll happen when you re about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Where is he?
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Do I know you?
That  s easy. You  ve seen my car.
Okay, I  ll take them...
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Hey, are you okay?
Of course I did.
You are an amazing lover. You should be giving motivational seminars.
I d like that, too.
Jersey? You know what the traffic s gonna be like?
Merry Christmas...
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
" Sensual blind chick seeks three ton, rock hard he man for deep spiritual relationship. "
I wouldn t know anything about that.
Relax, it s casual.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works
We got what we wanted. That s enough.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in
Five times.
He s made a few changes.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Reed. Even you can t compute every little thing.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect
I m sorry, did that cosmic bath loosen your screws?
Ben. Are you okay?
Yeah. You don t wanna know the details.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
' Course not. Strictly business.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she s not over it either.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Back on Earth. Victor s medical facility... We re in quarantine.
I swear to you they ve done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best
Don t come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said " together forever no matter what "?
I m worried about you.
What is this? Where s Reed?
The suit will stretch. You should try it
Oh, he did.
It s not him. It s them. I can t live like this.
It s easy for you to be patient.
And they re changing into...
Like the shields Reed said would protect us. How long?
What do you mean " complete "?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
But all these people...
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you re approaching supernova
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I m done with this freak show. I m moving back to the real world.
Look around, sis! She s not here. So you can stop talking to me like I m your little boy
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
And if he s not...?
It s not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Stable. We re looking at low twenties. It s a good number, considering the fallout from
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar " humanizes " you.
Yes sir. You ve got the Mayor at eight, then a nine thirty interview with the Journal
Get a grip. Reed. We didn t come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Ben did this.
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us
Yes, thanks.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship
What? What do you mean you
That s what we re here to find out.
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Are you kidding?
I think it was a little more complicated than
And reverse the mutations
Of course. Of course.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment
Every variable but yourself. You don t eat, sleep. You can t live in your head like
You were?
Why didn t you say something?
Reed, stop, you need to rest your
I understand the business reasons.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I ve come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with
Raising the shields.
I told you, I m fine. It s you I m worried about.
Oh, I think you already have.
I know it can t be easy. Life hasn t changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
For your sake I hope you re right. I m sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
That can t be there s no direct connection between the two
But it s hopeless! They can t go back and they can t go on. I tell you there s nothing else we can do but remove them!
The less time, the better.
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
It ll be close but there s still a margin of safety.
That blip we re picking up might only be the radio active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
If I were in their place and I d run out of time, I d abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
I d hold that off awhile.
The Other Side got to him.
Brain injury.
Sorry, but I m rusty on surgeons. Who s the girl?
We have no choice. Duval s the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he s right here, at hand.
.
We can shrink an Army with all its equipment and put it in a bottle cap. That s why we call it.
That s right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
And take a little trip with them...
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we ve decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery
As part of the Crew.
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
It s only for an hour
Yes?
Can t remember?... What do you mean?
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
I don t agree. Just because he s often difficult
We must!
Yes, Cora.
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
We re pushing oxygen today.
You sound as if you re not looking forward to it.
I think it s the most exciting We re going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself not something under a microscope... Just think of it
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
I ve been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
No, it requires such absolute precision
Oh yes, I m sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
That s what they pay me for.
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy. I suppose Duval s onto me, too?
Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
I can t breathe!... I ve got to get out!
I don t agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
Yes...
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation when it may be too late?
All I m asking is you test it beforehand!
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there s more than your damned ego at stake.
You left something out.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
Isn t there another route? So we can by pass all this?
What about Dr. Michaels?
At an operation?
If there s any chance
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
We re safe long as it remains that color... We re in the Pleural Sac. It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy and a wracking cough.
His Pleura s in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don t suppose what happened was an accident? Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
That line was tampered with...
You still never know what s going on in anyone s mind...
Two in a row?
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Once time s up, De Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
I thought I was on my vacation... What s it all about?
Where we going?
I m married.
Sort of.
They can t reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor s Miniaturized along with the submarine a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
Designed for Piscatorial Research the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Uh what?
Oh sure, sure! Never better!
Was there any damage?
I decided not to I m, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where s my daughter?
Where s my daughter?
Where s my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
No Jean, no money!
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!

Except that you were gonna be here at 7: 30.
Yeah, you already said that.

Sir? Right now?
Thank you, hon. How s Fargo?
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard. You re damned hard to get on the phone.
That s for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can t read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can t read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you re financing with this money, that they really exist.
I m sure they do ha ha! But I can t read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me
No, fax is no good, that s what I have and I can t read the darn thing
Okay, because if I can t correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it s being lent on.
No, no, fax is
Okay.

Jerome Lundegaard?
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
My patience is at an end.
Good day, sir.
It s okay, Scotty.
Whatcha watchin there?

You told me about it.
A heck of a lot. What d you say you were gonna put there?
I know it s a lot.
Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot ha ha ha!
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
What s goin on there?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it s pretty sweet.
We might be innarested.

His wife s in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he s a little darling. He s now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he s at large.

He s at Norstar.
Well
We re still men.
Six months ago, Bob s testicles were removed. Then hormone therapy. He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen. That was where my head fit into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God s as big.
... using steroids. I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol it s for racehorses, for Christsake. Now I m bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won t return my calls...

You don t get paid to abuse the copy machine.
Okay. Where to begin? With your constant absenteeism? With your unpresentable appearance? You re up for review...
Just who the fuck do you think you are?! Get out! You re fired!
No, I wasn t aware...
Maybe I died already. Look at my face.
Can t you give me something?
Sure.
What?
Practicing what?
I ll expose you.
It s cheaper than a movie, and there s free coffee.
A year? How d you manage that?
Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.

You take tuberculosis. My smoking doesn t go over at all.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you. You still have your balls.
You can t have both parasites. You can take blood parasites
Okay. I ll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia
You can t have the whole brain!

So you re staying in tonight?
What...?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Would you do something for me? I need you to check and see if there s a lump in my breast. I can t afford to throw money away on a doctor.
Please.
Tragically, they re dead. I m alive and I m in poverty. You want any?

Why would you ask if it s a guy or a girl?!
Let go of me... Leave me alone.
Can I come in?
What?
Marla, it s me. Have we... have we ever had sex?
Because the answer s " yes " or because the answer s " no? "
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
We did make love?
Answer the question!
We ve just lost cabin pressure.
What is wrong with you?
What...?
Tyler Durden! Tyler Durden, you fucking freak. What s going on? I m coming over there...
Your whacked out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom. I thought they were going to break my arm.
The were burning their fingertips with lye. The stink was unbelievable.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Absolutely, you have every right. I need you to do me a favor.
I know that I ve been... unwell. I know it s been like there s two sides to me.
I deserve that. Anyway, I ve... I ve only just realized
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me. I know this... I know us hasn t been such a great thing for you...
What?
You are an insane person.
I m sorry, but I...
I wasn t really dying, I wasn t host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
Look what we ve accomplised. Thirty seconds.
No, supply oxygen?
What do you want me to do?
The spork. I get it. You re very clever.
How s that working out for you?
Being clever.
And, now it s gone.
There s always that.
... no... no...
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
The " now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again " list. That list.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You ll be occupied for weeks.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Do what you like.
A hotel?
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
We re on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
Why don t you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Yes, you can.
You re welcome. But, I want you to do me one favor.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
It s called a " changeover. " The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
No one really knows that they ve seen it. But they did.
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
I don t know, either. I want to find out. I ve never been hit, have you?
I don t want to die without any scars. How much can you really know about yourself if you ve never been in a fight? Come on... you re the only person I ve ever asked.
This is crazy.
Where do you want it? In the face?
Strange.
Is it?
Call what off?
What fight?
Anyone?
He was setting up franchises. My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, " Now what? " He said, " Get a job. " When I turned twenty five, I called him and asked, " Now what? " He said, " I don t know. Get married. "
What car?
Hum.
Soldier of Fortune. Business Week. New Republic.
If you could fight any celebrity?
Doesn t matter.
Any historical figure.
Good answer.
Yeah, I m sure.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
Marla doesn t need a lover. She needs a case worker.
She d invaded my support groups, now she s invading my home.
Okay.
Yes, I promise.
I said I promise!
" The liberator who destroyed my property has re aligned my paradigm of perception. "

No, I m not...

Fucking sweet.

Homework assignment.
What should I have told you?
You know what I mean.
Look...
I want to know
What are you doing?!
You choose your level of involvement. I won t make decisions for you.
You re asking questions that don t have answers. You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
Fuck my life. Fuck fight club. Fuck you and fuck Marla. I m sick of this. How s that?
What?
... is over.
If the applicant is young, we tell him he s too young. Old, too old. Fat, too fat.

What s this all about, Tyler?
Why do people think I m you?
Why do people think I m Tyler Durden?
Answer me, Tyler.
What...?
What are you talking about...?
This isn t possible...
What... what are you saying?
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
What about them? They re lunatics.
The house is rented in your name.
Night jobs while you were sleeping.
What about Marla?
You... you can t be serious about this.
I can t let you...
I m going to...
I m not going...
Stop finishing...
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
Don t pull the green wire. Pull anything but the green wire.
Fuck your struggle. I want out.
I quit.
What?
Defuse the bomb, please.
I think this is about where we came in.
It s out of our hands. This is it.
Paraffin.
Not exactly according to plan.
Why what?
You need me.
Look, I can be selfish, I know that. I m not blind to my own failings...
... no, no, no...
Why are you doing this?!
Please understand... I ve gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
I swear on my life, I won t...
What have you left for me?
What?
What?
What?
Maintenance.
Very good, Sir.
Don t worry about us, sir. We re solid.
You told me you d say that.
You told me you d say that, too.
What he wanted? Look... look at him. Look at him! What does he want? This is a person. This is not a cog in your machine...
No, no. This is a man this man has a name...
No! Wrong! This man s name is Robert Paulson.
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
There is no money.
It s free to all.
Yes, it is.
You re welcome to join our club.
Pleeeeeease!
We need some towels, Lou. We need replacement light bulbs.
Thank you. Thank you, sir...
How d you know?
Yesssss...
Why?
Yeah... animals and s s s
I thought... I thought you might be able to help me.
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
Well, if you put them on the list, they re already tits up.
Congratufuckinglations. That makes you last to go. But don t worry, once the others are dead, it ll come back for you. Always does.
Signs?
The songs on the radio. But wait. I don t understand. Why is this even happening to me?
You were there?
So if you give us the pregnant lady s number, we can warn her about the lake and she ll live long enough to have the baby.
No. If anyone dies from a crash now, it ll be me. But I can t die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive. I m last on Death s list.
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Speed up.
Should we knock?
Don t sweat it. It s over.
Random, sure.
That lucky bastard.
Carter.
Yeah. Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
I ve got to stop and help those people.
Maybe. What s this about?
What was the fight about?
Does she have a cell phone? A way we can contact her?
Eighteen. And it s " Hebrew ".
Yeah?
Yeah, so what happened?
Alright miss, calm down. I just need this lane open. I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything. The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina s face...
I m not following you
We have to tell her she s in danger!
How are we going to find her? There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
How do you know?
Don t worry. Nothing can happen to us.
I don t... what if I made a mistake?
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
Sure.
I guess so.
Yeah?
I m... really sorry.
I ve never dealt with death before. I wasn t alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it s everywhere.
I don t know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe... I would know.
I think. But why d they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
Thirty nine.
Right. April 25th.
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
No.. I mean, I don t have anything on me. This won t be safe.
No! No! Don t!
I don t.
You get off havin control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
You re the fuckin devil.
" Intervention? " What are you, God now?!
C mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck em over Greenland, or something?
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
" Next? "
Billy! I m gettin a vision! You re the next one...
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
That s what I m doin!
Huh?
No.
Yeah. It s not hard once you get the hang of it. In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
Really? How come he didn t take me?
Insertion. Call in to base camp by TRANSAT. Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact. Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao. We ve been over this three times.
Ninety.
Show me how it operates.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
Read you.
Modified M 16 A2 and over under M 79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC / R 100 Laser sighting system.
No.
That s a real good reason to wind up in Nam.
Buddhist monastery. Fifteenth century.
No cigarettes.
How come we didn t just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
She likes you. Says you re dinky dau.
Powerful warrior.
Sometimes they do. They re river pirates. Opium runners.
American?
Alright. Home run.
What? Are you crazy? We re supposed to take pictures and split. You re gonna blow the whole program.
Yes.
You comin?
It s a Soviet MIL MI 24. Probably has 12. 7mm nose cannon, heat seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
I have arranged transportation. We meet soon. But I think you to be disappointed.
I thought he was with you.
Spooks?
Huntington Beach, California.
Yes. But I lose many merits in next life. Very bad.
Rambo. NVA coming. Pig dog Kinh say meet them here. Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Carefully. Don t want to get shot by you. Bad karma. Anyway, you need me.
You think you are....
Yeah. Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
How you going to get there? You can t trust the spooks to pull you out. They ll use you up and throw you away.
Sorry, Sir. Can t do it.
I m authorized to get you out of here. I thought that s what you wanted.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out. Two men. Two days.
We like you. At least the computer at Langley likes you. Pulled your file because of various factors. Service record. Area familiarity.
Not yet.
What s the plan?
We don t try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
We just take pictures?
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
Sir, there s something else... a TRANSAT relay. Just came through.
Christ almighty.
What?
About 22 hours on site.
POWs? I don t know. But either way it ll get that subcommittee off our necks. Cream?
Listen, Kirkhill. I m a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I d go out with the extraction team tonight. Unless you have an objection.
I know.
Look, Colonel... we re all adults here. This is a war. A very quiet, very intense war. People get sacrificed.
You think I m some whacko? I like to hurt people? I m doing a job here. If I knew what s right or wrong I d be a goddamned priest, right? So I follow directives... I do what I m told. It s simple. If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn t be a problem.
This mission was a scam from the word go?
It was clean. Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said " No POWs " the sub committee would buy it. He gets himself caught he s a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own. If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D. C. Airtight. But no... Rambo s gotta be a hero. Thinks he s starring in his own war movie or something. He put me in a corner. No choice.
It s not over. You made one mistake.
American. Come to get you out.
Can you walk?
Colonel.
Am I out of here?
There were treating me like a headcase.
Those men are all dead.
Yeah. Big time.
Five. I never wanted that stuff.
I just wanted... I don t know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say " you did good, John. " And mean it. That s all. After all that.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I ll nail your hide to the shed.
But now it s free, right?
Well did you or didn t you?
Can I get you anything... coffee... tea... a little tequilla?
Well, there s nobody special!
I mean, it s not easy in this day and age.
Meeting... people.
I never really... went through a... dating period.
I can t believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I d stab myself six times.
I don t understand you. What is the problem?
That s not true... You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it... We re having a lovely conversation.
Really?
This food s delicious. You re a wonderful cook. And you have a lovely home.
I m shocked. With a child bearing body like yours...... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Anne, they re MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
It s not funny. It s... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
I was attacked.
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
No, I m fine... really...
I... I stayed at a friend s. Listen, I
You still believe in God?
Oh stop. Things will change. My Aunt Mary always said, there s a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
You didn t kill anybody. Stop.
Hello, I d like to speak to Lydia?
I don t know her last name... I ll be off in a second.
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I... uh...
The moron?
And who s Lydia?
What? The curse ll be lifted? Will you please!
Don t treat me like I m stupid. It pisses me off.
What does that mean?
Well, what the hell does that mean?
Who s knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, " some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores ".
Well... I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I m very proud.
My agent. I called my agent.
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem. He wants me to come in and talk and... and... that s it!
Thanks.
" I m an incredible woman? " What is this, a death sentence?
You want to talk? Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
Slowed things down? Where have I been? Have we been going fast!?
First of all, let me tell you something you don t know shit. Second of all, as far as we go, what time do you need? What have we been doing here, except time? Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
I didn t know. I just said all I want is some time.
Listen! We both got something out of it, all right!
How have you been?
He can t hear you. Hi... I m Dr. Weintraub.... I was on duty when they brought him in... I ve been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...... " catatonic stupor "... condition rendered him non verbal for a period of...
I m afraid not... Then again, I m not sure. The beating s bad but it s not the problem... It seems he s.. re experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years....... I don t know. There s no way to tell.
Well, it s not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain s replay system. The brain never loses anything it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives? Well, it doesn t matter. We ll take care of it. He ll have to be sent back to the same institution..
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she s never home... But I think we ll go out this weekend... I ve...
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Uh... basement I think...
No... He is supposed to live there?
Tragedy?
I m... just looking for Parry...
Uh... Where... where do you want to go?
Where? Maybe we can.
Come on... maybe we can... where do you want to go?
NO... I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
It was a crime.
I... I was just leaving.
Yes... I... I agree...
You re so witty. I m so jealous... I need to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
Fine. I ll say no.
Fine.
Jack, it s a sitcom you re not defining Pi.
No, I have to work.
I was nine in the sixties.
Yes well... You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Well, I don t understand. What did you do did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Well were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Well, I mean... I don t know you... This has never... I ve never won anything and... I don t have a VCR.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
How much?
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry? Breakfast? A fruit pie perhaps?
My name is Parry.
They re What?
What!?
The Little People?
I m the one what?
Uhh... I m drawing a blank.
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no... I m on a very special quest.
But I need help and they sent you.
They work for Him.
I know! You can t imagine how surprised I was. Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
Oh, please... you re embarrassing me.
Listen, forget the shoes. I ll just take a cab... Uh...
Parry... I m Jack.
Huh huh. I m deeply smitten.
Can I take you to lunch?
Well what am I gonna do with it?
You can t just break into Langdon Carmichael s house. This man has done nothing.
All right! Listen please... don t start drooling or... rolling your eyes when I tell you this but You shouldn t do this.. There is no Holy Grail.
Look, you re only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi normal lives. You could get a job...
I take it back you re fucking deranged... And you re going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
Please don t hug me in public again, O. K.?
You re a true friend.
You re a real honest to goodness good guy.
That s why the Little People sent you. Just like magic.
So what? You going to help me?
The Red Knight!
Who?
Well that s stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it s fair they keep us out just because they make us think we ll get killed or something?
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body ya little fella s flappin in the breeze.... everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we re bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Who are you talking to Jack?
What?
Parry, you don t have to earn a woman. It s the twentieth century.
Well, see, I think she can help... You know women are great.. they... they make homes and they.. ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and... and slaughter villages with a clear head... I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going... gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
I m sorry.... I m just so excited. You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
Tch... how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn t already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne d never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
No. Nothing bad s going to happen. Anne ll be there. I ll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
It s just a bum... You know, there s enough in here for the two of you.
Fag.. a fag you say!?... " Curst wolf! Thy fury inward on thyself Pray and consume thee! "
You advise us!
No just Parry.
I don t like horror movies!
I don t like... uh... Polish love stories...... I like musicals.
What a gyp.
It sounds exciting.
There isn t any more to tell.
No, really.. believe me there isn t any more. This is it.
You don t have to say that.
I mean you don t have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we re about to do.
Well... you re walking me home. I... I guess you re sort of... attracted to me and you ll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
... and then we ll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we ll... then you ll sleep over and then in the morning...... you ll be distant and you won t be... able to stay for breakfast... you ll just have some coffee maybe...
Listen, I m not feeling well.
Listen, you re very nice... b...
Oh... You mean you don t want to.
You re married.
Divorced.
You have a disease.
I leave it to you.
Twinky?
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
A wig?
Well, lemme play the other side then.
You said.
Serveza yourself!
You can sing the song.
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
I m not.
Yes.
You re the pathetic one, not me.
I m not some piece a crap.
You treat me like I was.
You go slippin around in front a my face, an in front a Elton an Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
You re goin a find me dead one time.
If you really want a get up an leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
I love it.
No.
Is what you?
Who said I was depressed?
If you can t do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
Or maybe sit out by the pool an get myself nice an tan for you. Would you like that?
It brings out my eyes...
What?
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an me in front of the place...
No.
You re lucky no one was hurt.
Washington.
Where are you going?
How do you know it s clean?
Who?
I didn t get it, did I?
No. How much do I owe you?
What does that mean? You don t have any tomatoes?
But I can t have any. Is that what you mean?
I know what it comes with, but that s not what I want.
I m sorry, we don t have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven t broken any rules.
Am I on TV?
Well, you seem very professional...
Now don t...
Well, I don t mean to. Here s your tea, Tita.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
You know who it once belonged to?
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Very nice.
Everybody still up on the Island?
Who s Van Oost?
Carl s a fiddler. What s he doing coaching piano?
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck. That s Carl...
What?
Oh, well, what, what s he...
I m going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Yeah, me, too...
Tita, I ve got to go...
Uhm hmm. Some range.
Yes, it is. I can t take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
No, I don t. You should ve left a long time ago.
Well, do you I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you ve been doing?
No, no, I don t think that, I m just curious about it... Do you think I m a freak?
No, I don t really think you re a freak.
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
Uhm hmm.
You re attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
What?
Why are you being so mean?
Where s Catherine?!
Yeah. I said a week, and I ve overstayed myself...
I didn t want to say goodbye to anyone.
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
I guess you fell in the water.
That s dangerous, you know.
Well, I wouldn t want to get too invigorated myself.
Well, there s fishing and boating. There s concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
Tomorrow, then.
The day after tomorrow.
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
Thank you.
It wasn t supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
Nothing. It s just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
I didn t have any.
None.
Well, at least you re accomplished at something...
I think it s what you think.
I don t think that s accurate...
I m not faking anything. I m looking for some bath oil...
It s direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
That s right.
That s what you said?
I m fine.
Is he?
What?
I m going to pick up some friends of Carl s. Are you all right?
No, you don t have to, it isn t necessary...
Will you let me talk to you, please?
Oh. You have to tell me that.
Catherine...
Just give me a chance, will you?
Yes.
What?
What?
All right, let s have a rematch.
No, I don t, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
No, it s okay.
For two whole weeks, an there wasn t hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an it must a ben, because other n me, there was just this 25 year old kid, DeLyon, that didn t appear to be all there, an this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an them, hollerin away...
Well, I was goin to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an took so long, I ran flat outa money... I didn t have no number to call, you know. So I hadda clear outa there an come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn t be intrudin myself...
Well, thank you, that s a very nice thing for you to say.
It s a Borzoi.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
It is true.
Oh, my, " a summit conference. " I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
I hope I didn t hear that.
What about it? Wouldn t you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
You haven t dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
That s an old maid s tale.
Don t call me " honey, " mack.
I wouldn t be a waitress. They re nasty and full of crap.
What do you mean " mass "... I have to come out and tell you, you re not that clean, either.
Well, you re not that bad, but some people... I mean, people s homes, just filth. I ve been in people s homes...
In my personal thing, I don t see that. I m seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
Steam.
There s some good things on it, though.
The TV. There s some good things on it, sometimes.
Well, she was.
Aaron, how you doin?
Look at me.
Why you have an attitude for?
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
Then don t go out with me.
Now she s tellin me what the fuck to do.
There s a rumor that you were tryin to get somebody to beat me up.
Then I want you to go to whoever s sayin that and tell them to stop.
Victor.
Hi.
Nothin.
I, umm, came to see you.
No. What you do today?
Of course.
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
You got a boyfriend?
Just chill.
You look good.

I kissed those girls.
I aint gotta prove nothin to no girl, cause I got it like dat.
Wussup, Victor.
I got punished, man.
I won t let my motha cut my hair.
She fucks it all up!
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
Natasha, Maria, Tina

She lives near Eddie?
Near Natasha s? Or over by Boy s Club?
For real?
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
How old is he?
You gonna talk to him?
Yeah.
Wha?
Yeah.
A girl named Amanda.
She s like this high, dark hair, skinny
She didn t say she had no man.
Positive.
Positive.
Your friend must be misinformed.
I m a good friend of hers.
Yo, I know what you re thinking, that I m one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
What?
Not really.
Jus from around the way.
Yeah.
Unbelievable.
Utah? Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock. The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
You re kidding.
So he s going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
You mean her.
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn t work in your office, she s not from around here.
Whaddyamean maybe?
He doesn t know? How come he doesn t know?
Sonofabitch.
I have no idea.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he s outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he s got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
I ought to get some sleep.
Nineteen.
Fletch, this is dumb.
They didn t do anything.
I busted their window, they didn t do anything.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve. So what s your name?
Full name.
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
It was planted on me, sir.
I m about to break that beach wide open, and I don t need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
Maybe I m not going to keep you here. Maybe I m gonna blow your brains out.
My God, you re serious.
Not a prayer.
We play tennis at the club.
Yes.
Well, I haven t played in a while because of these kidney pains.
That s Babar.
One. B a b a r.
But not right next to each other. I thought that s what you meant.
I don t know. I don t have any.
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Your aunt?
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Well, which one?
Funny old bird.
I ll bet. Shame about Ed.
Oh, he was dying for years.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Just relax....
Breathe easy...
There is?
Just relax.
I can t discuss another patient. You know that. Well, I can t find anything wrong with you.
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
Tell the nurse when you ve got a few free days. She ll make all the arrangements.
No idea.
Okay. Some idea.
Like tonight.
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
Fletch...
You don t know me.
I m serious, Sam.
Affirmative.
Affirmative.
For me. I m a reporter, Sam. I m breaking the drug story and I got the chief red handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
I m gonna nail the chief. And you can help or
You don t have a piece of the action?
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You ll get federal protection after that.
What?
Gum thought Brazil.
What about breaking and entering? Are you wearing anything under that?
She doesn t need the money, for crissakes. She s living with Monty. I know it.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can t get lower than that...
My lawyer was a bum.
You may be right.
That s history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Found it in a cab. That s a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
Harry S. Truman?
Isn t that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You re in the insurance line, Harry?
Well, I m fully covered.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Check.
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Boy, what the hell s the matter with you?
And they re still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
Where are you going?
Right.
Gee, I must have been shit faced at your wedding, I don t
Hi Gummy. How  s the eye?
I know.
They bust you every week.
Fletch?
What?
What s that?
I didn t sell nothing! I didn t sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
Yeah. Maybe.
Why not?
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
I think you ve got the wrong gal, fella.
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Who?
I m all ears.
I don t feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it ll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I d rather not be around for it.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
You re a drifter, a pardon the expression beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I ve watched you for a couple weeks.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I ve watched. I ve thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It s the staff s night off. These will be open.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
Very good. My. 357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Sure, all drifters do.
Where am I going?
They serve dinner on the flight?
You ve certainly thought this out, haven t you?
You sure those doors will be open?
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
You sure got the hard part.
Can I steal you for a minute?
Deal.
Kareem s in the wash. I need a favor.
Not me.
Married Boyd Aviation. He s no dummy, that s serious coin.
Not our kind of people, you understand.
You doing a story on this guy?
I wonder if that s his doctor.
Yeah.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un believable. Jesus. It s the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they re all over Frank.
I m sorry?
Cute thing.
No, thank you.
Yes, I m with the Underhills.
They ll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
Great. I ll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
In her cabana, sir.
Cabana one.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
I recommend it.
No thanks, I ll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Lock s busted.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
What?
Who are you?
Moved out.
She moved out.
This morning.
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I m going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
I m her cousin.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
Uh, almost.
Irwin...
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
No it s not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
I don t know. Look!
You broke it? You know the source?
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
He s not the story! There s a source behind him.
Well, there we re in a gray area.
I d say charcoal.
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I m really on to something here.
Utah?
What about finding the source?
Who? Donnie and Marie?
It s called journalism, Fletch. It s called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don t know anything about.
Get out of here.
You know, I ve had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
But not unsubstantiated charges about dope dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
I want something I can print!
What? Who the hell are they?
What...
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
You were going to can me, right?
Not really?
I m sick of this place. I m going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
Jim Swarthout?
Frieda s boss.
But I ain t got you...
No, I ain t got you...
I said, I ain t got you...
Don t say it. Orange juice?
Mr. Fairlane, I m very rich. The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me. When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Who s your decorator?
Fag? Ass? I m sorry, is that a joke?
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Excuse me?
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Oh... I have some questions.
Who?
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k i s s i n g...
So you...
Nonsense. After what you ve been through, it sounds like I owe you.
I ll do my best.
I ll buy you a new one. I found her.
Have what?
Lots of things. Her favorite yogurt. The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
Damn, Ford, you re the most cynical man in the industry and that s not easy.
Assistant. And don t call me Jazz.
Fucking Australians! I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don t we do nuclear testing there?
Rock stars! I m going out of my mind. All I get are perks. I don t make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks. I want cash. Moulah. Wampum. Dead Presidents. Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money. Doritos cost money. I m gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
Spooky. I ll process her.
You re a fucking gentleman. What do you want from me?
You don t want to know, believe me. But don t worry, I washed my hands...
No, as a matter of fact you didn t. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in? I mean, she is what this case is about.
Make eye contact when you say that.
Contacts.
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl. Period.
Yeah, let s bury her.
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold blooded killer behind everything.
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
C. D. s. The music kind. From the Grendel label.
Let s get hitched. I guess I, you know, love you. It s a beautiful thing.
Why are all these people after me?
I dunno. He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so. Ever since he died, I ve been chased... Omigod!
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
You know rock n roll? Darlin, I ve been in the music industry for as long as you ve lived. I ve seen things you can t even have nightmares about... but then I guess I m just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
No. Who s Art Mooney?
Friends? You didn t tell me that.
Stop. We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we ve been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
People still watch that?
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo: Fuck the purse, we re gonna die e e. '
Smooth. I know this is dangerous and everything but it s kind of fun. Ever see " Batman, " you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it s pretty funny.
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy. Kill! Kill! Kill!
Well what is it? I m not Kreskin.
Hey, you, get off my cloud. I m talking to my friend. 1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Did he just say what I think he said?
You need it.
Shut up, you dummy. Who did this to you?
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
And hey, I appreciate it...
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Who s my real father, man?
You think you re so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you re so hot, just because you have sex with great looking women. You think you re so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
Why do you hate me? It s gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
Disco Ex man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna be with the six inch platform shoes. He looked...
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
That s okay. I m quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer. Pay s the same, but it ll be much more fun.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn t even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies. The Village People rotted your brain.
I guess you never saw A Very Brady Christmas. '
Fine!
I m off it!
The case!
Oh, but I am. Dianetics, Ford. You should try it.
I m. The. Biggest. Sissy. In. The. Wide. World.
You gotta be kidding! This is unfuckingbelievable! I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young! Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it s toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard! Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I ve usually treated women like shit used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino s Pizza s phone number and saying it s mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect. I felt love. Then Jazz left me... and now I get to die!
Let me go out like a man.
Boing. You re one hell of a lip reader.
Mmmmmmm. Mmmm, mmm.
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end. Isn t your enjoyment impaired?
Shock.
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits. Shit, just start torturing me, man. I didn t even know Johnny had a disc and I can t deal with any Don t play games with me, Mr. Fairlane bullshit.
It s 7: 30. You really should get a watch.
I m running a little late. You see, I m having a party at THE Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit. Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
Fuck me...
When I was young, I read Billboard and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
You re a poet and didn t know it.
Only on a first name basis.
That s funny, you re cute.
Fucking amazing, huh? Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit! Still in La la land. Look at us, two rock n roll dicks. Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
I don t remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock n Roll Detective.
It s my daughter, man. I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl. She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she s been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L. A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros. You have to get my baby back, she s my pride and
I don t take cases with foundations in bullshit. They are very hard to walk around in.
Zuzu Petals. Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Doyle.
Mr. Doyle.
I m clean.
No no.
Everything is everything.
There s nothing around. Nobody s holding.
Boca?
Doesn t register.
No, nothing. There s only some talk.
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
Where do you want it?
Takin care o business, honey.
Where m I goinna get a pizza this time o night?
I don t know where I m gonna find a pizza joint open.
Yeah?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
I wasn t looking.
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on but for me, I am finished.
Who s this
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington? I haven t spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Je peux l ouvrir tout de suite?
Avec  a tu pourras le supporter.
Pour moi?
Formidable! Sans toi je m habillerais encore en docker. Je suis pass  voir Fran  oise.
I m going to put them on the cat.
Il fallait le faire.
Je crois qu on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
J ai pas confiance en lui.
What happens to the schedule?
He is not wrong.
It was built in 1917 and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world. The arch is still the largest in the world.
Most New Yorkers never notice it most Americans have never heard of it.
What?
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer. I come by to help you carry out your money.
You want some eggs.
Hey, Mutch! You want bacon?
Where the hell is it?
Strike out, eh?
A piece of ass wouldn t kill me.
Morning. Sometime.
Look. My partner and I found this case and I don t want no Feds screwing it up.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
How d I know he had a knife.
Drink this.
Policy man in Queens.
Hunh uh. Check the bread. He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
Give who a tail?
What for you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
Make it Alexander s, I like the toy department.
Suspicion of what?
Tell everybody we ll be back in an hour.
Yeah.
Hiya, Jesus.
This is what the tough guys are wearin. You know I only steal from the best. It s Bonwit Teller.
Forty dollars was  250.
Why is it called Hellgate?
What is that old building?
What was it?
For garbage?
I been damn careful up to now.
I m straight, Joel. They haven t got shit on me. Look, I m tellin you, he ll take the deal somewhere else.
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
You remember Mary Finelli?
You know what I m saying.
What I know is what I told you.
So what?
Yeah.
That s Deleon and Hayes collar.
Just missed Deleon. Hayes is up in the squad.
No, I think he s up in interrogation.
Baltimore?
Hey, Rookie. Be cool. Just stay with me. This is what we do.
Stay with me, Gib. We re gonna do this.
Don t know what s behind it.
You alright?
You didn t marry Donna Reed.
Did he?
It was under control, Bud. Butchy s just getting tight in his old age.
I tucked him in at Gordo s.
One in each ear. What would you do without me?
Wish you weren t.
Okay...
Honey, what is it? Just tell me.
I know. He loves that thing.
I m serious.
The future guy?
I think you know, Frank.
Let s go outside and talk. We need to do that.
No. This isn t what you think.
Okay, okay. I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
Uh, huh... Uh, huh. And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
Uh, huh.
He s not gonna stop, Satch. He s gonna keep on...
How s that?
Frank, please...
Frank, this is insane...
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
Next time lets put some money on it.
I know. Sorry, Dad.
Daddy put the wheels back on. I m gonna fall.
Daddy, I m scared.
Don t be scared. This time I m right behind you if you fall.
Wait...
WB2YKXB, who ve I got?
Look, I don t really remember how this thing works.
Queens, New York.
I thought these things were for talkin around the world.
I don t really follow baseball anymore.
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
Hello?
Huh?
Wasn t too tough, buddy. Game happened almost thirty years ago.
What d you just say?
Uh huh...
Frank... Frank Sullivan.
Look pal, I m just askin how you...
Right... and I m asking how you called the game.
What?
I m dreaming this. Shit, this is a dream.
What?
I don t know.
Sun spot?
I m thirty five years old.
Too busy playin ball, huh?
I think I m losing you.
It s okay. I m still here, Chief.
I lost you.
I never knew you, Dad.
Fire.
It was an abandoned warehouse hit by lightening. Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn t your fault. You went with the training, with your instincts. If you d just gone left instead of right, you would ve made it.
It did, Pop. It did.
Chief?! Is that you?
Tell me.
What, Johnny? What is it?
Dad... Dad... There s... I need to...
Something happened, something...
It s Mom.
She s not here.
She... she died. It s like it just happened.
October 22, 1969.
There was this case. A serial. He murdered three women, all nurses, between 68 and 69. The papers called them the Nightingale Murders. They never caught him. But the killings just stopped.
Dad, we did something. Something to make it worse.
He didn t just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
Something we did changed the case... changed history. Mom wasn t dead. But then after you didn t die in the fire something must have happened. And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing... it was like a spree... seven more women.
I don t know... What about the other women?
That ll never work. They ll just think you re crazy.
No. Nobody got... Wait a minute. I might not know who he is, but I know where he s gonna be. I got the case file. We know what he s gonna do before he does it.
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad. You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
What if the radio stops working? Christ, what if I can t reach you again?
Did you see him? Do you know who he is?
It s okay. This is working. This is gonna work.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights Mary Finelli. Girl disappeared in 68. Turns out she was his first kill. Which means he probably knew her. Most serials know their first victim. I m gonna do some checking see if I can put any of this together...
Didn t happen, we got enough problems down here.
We re okay... we re good, Dad.
You really wanna know?
Well, game five was the big one. It turned in the bottom of the 6th. We were down 3 0. Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up. The count goes to 2 2. High fastball. He nailed it. Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th. We won, Pop.
I m right here, Dad.
Yeah, I think so...
It s not your fault, Dad.
I know... But Dad, you can t go back. You didn t die in that fire. And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that. So all we can do is deal with this... and try to make it right.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
John, he s got my driver s license.
He took my driver s license, John, he knows where we live.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
In my pocket.
What?
How the hell am I gonna do that?
What...
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Yeah, Dad. What the hell is going on?
What s wrong?
No. I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn t go in.
The warehouse. Buxton seeds. It s tomorrow.
Longbranch...?
Huh?
Fire? What are you talking about? He had cancer, John.
Gordo?
Oh don t worry kid, I know where you live. Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy. Y a h o o. It s a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
She made up her mind. Nothin I do is gonna change it.
I m sorry. I just... you know... I...
Ten? No. I remember this case. Three. He killed three women.
April 16...? That means she was the first.
So you figure the murders stop cause he s off the street. Then by the time he gets paroled, he s smartened up enough to control himself?
Uh, huh.
Sounds good.
So how are things at the hospital?
No kidd n, he musta been pushing 90!
Oh, I loved it. I wish you d gone.
You work too hard, John.
Yeah... I remember. I used to play cops and robbers but y... my mom wouldn t let me have a toy gun.
She s pretty special.
I try to be.
Yeah. I just wish I d told her how proud I was of her.
No. No. Well, sort of. In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Yeah, long time ago. I know you?
A hot shot, huh?
I hear that.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak to an att
Where are you going?
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
I found this today. There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe " he " wanted me to have this...
I beg your pardon, I m not an asshole. I m an actor.
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World s Record several whacks ago.
Cool it, Andy.
I don t know...
We haven t looked in the barn, yet. Let s take a look.
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
I vote for me.
I think it s called " a shower ". You might try it sometime.
Barely.
That s the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
I can t even remember what day it is, man.
Nothin. I was just foolin around.
Will you come with me?
Your bed.
I m sorry. I just wanted to surprise you. What can I say?
Is that so bad?
You re irresistible. I lose control.
What?
Did you stay here last night?
Somebody was in here.
It s deceiving.
... To prove something to myself... to prove I m stronger than I think I am.
I m here with you. Can t that be enough for now?
You promised you d never ask me.
You re Shelly?
My whole world.
Why don t you help us?
Come on, Shelly. Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Everything s gonna be fine.
Yes.
Just a dirty window. Next time, I ll know how to handle a situation like that. Let s just hope that " next time " isn t too soon.
No time to explain. Just listen. When I yell " stop, " you jam on the brakes as hard as you can. Okay?
I have to.
I just want you to like me.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
You don t to say it. I can tell.
Who s Horace?
Go out and plug the cord back in.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
Why?
That s a freakin fact. Least of all us.
He really believes Jason s still alive, doesn t he?
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Now wait a second! I thought Burt shot you.
You don t know for sure. What about Roy? Nobody s seen him.
This is taking forever. I m starving.
My ass.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
Not what... who. Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
Daddy, what is going on?
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now. Something happened tonight and he s sure you re responsible. If he finds you, he ll...
Uh... yes. But...
No.
Wait a minute. I just...
It probably wouldn t have any effect on him. The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
Did you hear me?!
Nancy.
Why?
Are they grown ups?
But what I get scared again?
Are you ready? He s taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Boy scouting.
Huh? Oh, come on, Sis. I m tellin ya, we can t play Clue with just two people.
No... Did Megan say when she s coming back from her... visit?
I don t know. He called somebody, then took off.
Will you listen, dammit!
Hold it. Whoa... What s your name, son?
Yeah. Jason murdered them and...
Either you go to sleep or I ll come in there and put you out.
I ve seen it.
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
Eight times. They ve burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste
Look, just shut up. Let s cut through the shit. You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya. I ll do it, but it won t be easy... and it won t be cheap. One hundred grand, non negotiable.
So let s talk.
The what?
I m here.
I need to talk to you.
I m going to kill Jason Voorhees and I need you to help me.
You know he s not... and he s coming for you.
Twenty.
Thirty. Name your price. Everyone has a price, what s yours?
You know what I want. You know why I need you.
I know everything about you, Diana.
It s going.
Okay. So how is Jessica? You talked to her lately?
Sorry, Di. I was just going to my car. I didn t mean to frighten you...
I m just too old for going steady, Josh.
Okay.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
She s your lady only cause she ain t had a taste of the Duke yet.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show " bounty hunter " making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
For a good reason.
Sorry.
Her name s Stephanie.
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid. Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone. This one, for instance.
Oh, c mon, would you stop, please?
Oh my God, Steven.
I m now begging you.
Sorry, I m working now. You see, I have a job...
Yeah...
I m sorry. I have to bring you to a cell.
Okay.
What am I gonna do I m locked up in a friggin cell?!
Until I hear the truth.
The truth? That Josh, a man I ve trusted with my own life on more than one occasion let me see if I ve got the order right here tried to rape Diana... got the back of his head blown off... took a poker through the gut... fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
You don t know shit!
Then why were you at her house?! She didn t want anything to do with you.
About what?
That s a lie. Diana would never talk to you about Jessica. Not after what you did to her.
No she left me! After her miscarriage, I
She did have a miscarriage, didn t she? Didn t she?!
Never.
I mean really never.
She s a waitress at Joey B s but she needs some extra cash. Ward s the pimp.
Ten dollars! Hell, I can t do that to you you can have her for a pizza.
The Captain s been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
No. And I m not losing any sleep over it.
So what else is new? Look Eva, you re asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up it s not hip to be her friend.
Really?
He bought you that?
What are you going to do?
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
Sounds good. I hear there s a shuffleboard court on deck it might be kinds cool...
What? Don t be a lightweight... this is top dollar toot.
You re talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I m going to risk getting caught?
I have her in Creative Writing and she s fairly nice.
Yeah.
I think I ll pass. See you later, okay?
Never mind, you don t want to know about it.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
And you ll never do it again.
She s... she s dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
This is Jason s fault!
They re out of town.
I m staying.
She didn t push me into coming.
But Sean said...
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
I m not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
I... I can t...
Hi, Sean.
But I didn t get you one...
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
Where are they?
I m not going near any lifeboat!
Very big.
What did you find?
You are going where?
What do you mean, we must abandon?
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
Paisley Porter. I didn t know you were waiting tables.
This is a great young out of work actress.
Alla puttanesca.
Shut up, Elliot.
Press a button and they give us money.
She wants a divorce.
It s over, finished and done with.
I m completely stunned. I don t want this to happen.
Don t needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We re suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
Asbestos lining.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
What do I exude?
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
Shit. They don t have any carrot soup.
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
That s what I said eighteen months ago.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
What was it like?
Do we care?
I say we go.
Do not inhale.
Don t wait Efor me.
Where is it?
No, we re not.
It s your best play, Nicky.
 The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks fuzzy, grubby and shifty eyed. I m telling you as a friend.
The American theater doesn t need people like that.
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
Paisley Porter.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn t tell me who.
Unbelievable.
What are you talking about?
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Does what feel comfortable?
I hear Alan s sick.
You know about Adele.
She s dying.
I talked to her two days ago.
Our Peter?
Can he get through it?
I ve got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
About what?
Look. All I want is a haircut. I m not worried about this guy.
They can send their heartless brilliant boy critic. There s a much bigger thing going on than tonight s opening.
The Red Sox
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there s a tragedy in the making. I ve been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
This is how we ve managed to last.
In and out of bed.
It s all worked out. They ll lose tonight. Then they ll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
They ll lose because they re my team.
I go to college. I thought you knew.
I don t drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
Why do you need a radio?
That s completely crazy.
Don t talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there s no turning back.
Don t be so steely eyed. It s that course you re taking in criminology.
You re too young to be studying criminal behavior. It s making you obsessive.
Don t call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother s not going.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
I have a class. I m late.
Except I won t have a father anymore.
First you tell me.
Packs an emotional wallop.
Yes.
We re strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
Mystery. Deception.
What s sexy?
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
It s your best play, Nicky.
I ve seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It s a brave and honest piece of work.
Two all after six.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
All right. What s been going on?
How prominent?
I don t want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
Who the hell cares?
That s always been my problem.
You know why, don t you? Because I am patient, chain smoking Lillian.
I d forgotten that.
That s very lovely actually.
Be open with me. I d like that.
I want to know. We haven t talked this way in years.
Joanne Bourne.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
It violates so many trusts.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
I m glad we re having this talk.
Washed away.
What did it say?
I m at the door.
Pop, will you let me in?
It s me. Nicky.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
I m on my way to get a haircut.
Five s not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
You know the answer to that.
They re only gonna lose.
It s one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
Don t make me sit through one of your plays.
Since when did that matter?
My back is killing me.
I can t find it.
I lost it. I lose everything.
I know, Pop.
I think the building s okay. At least for the time being.
Normal boy s ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
So what are you going to do about it?
Everybody else does. Why not you?
Oh yeah?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
Matthew s my grandson.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew s mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
That s a simple subject.
What am I doing?
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
Wife and daughter. My father s still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn t it?
I don t know Toyota. What does he do?
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It s a lifetime s work.
" It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day. "
I want to believe.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
Life is good.
Because God loves a winner.
Washed away.
Why does it matter?
Why do you care?
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
If you re such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
Hat was this morning.
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He s here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
To go to the theater. Wears I don t know what. Make up, padding.
Sidney.
I was educated by nuns.
I have excellent long term memory.
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
What color?
Burnt sienna.
This is your history, isn t it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
I was in the fish market play. What happened to him?
I think I remember.
Not one of Steven s finer moments.
A little.
He has something. A funny little quality I find
Engaging.
A little drastic maybe?
What?
Alla puttanesca.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
I hear good things about the new play.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
He doesn t want to meet some out of work ingenue.
The fact is, I have to get going.
Is what true?
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
I don t know.
Where are you going now?
Someone waiting for you?
There s a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
So everything. That s so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Yes.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
I haven t come to you.
Of course it s unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can t live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They d come after me in packs.
And I thought, at last, she s here, she wants me.
Are you sure?
Everyone takes his turn.
In this place there are no untouchables and no work is beneath any of us!
I m sorry.
Yes. I ve I ve met some very remarkable people in India... and and when I read what you ve been doing here, I I wanted to help. Does that surprise you?
I thought you were a man of God.
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
Back in South Africa... long time ago.
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman trying to figure everything out.
" Hell! "
A a week.
The Government s afraid, and they don t know what to do. But they re more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non violence.
It was one incident.
He s waiting. He s not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
Hm. And what should an " important professional " write about your response to General Smuts s new legislation?
You will respect the law.
Hm. Is it?
A great deal.
Good. Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
I m hardly that, Mr. Patel.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
No. You were the surprise. It s been all over the prison. We thought they d be too afraid of the English press.
My wife publicly defied the law. They ve arrested her and four others.
It s split the Government.
I dined at the prison.
Yes yes. It s just that... in these clothes I d I d prefer to go by taxi.
I m I m afraid I have no money.
Come with me now, Vincent. You ve gone as far as you can go.
It s over.
It s for the best.
You didn t beat me that day. I beat myself.
Not yet, I m afraid.
I guess I m a slow learner.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
Jerome?
Now you re here. Who are your " friends "?
I ve been looking for him. Do you know where he is?
What s wrong with him?
Six one.
I think I d better choose the menu. After all, you re learning how to be me, I m not learning how to be you.
Listen, I don t want you to think I m ungrateful I know you and that little broker what do you call him?
If anybody asks, tell them the truth your family disowns you. You are a disappointment, Jerome.
You had to be a right hander.
More than that. You ll get used to it.
Leave? Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair in our bodies was a part of a star. I don t see it as leaving. I see it as going home.
The Mission Director.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
Hey, how much of you can be there? Even if the " J. Edgars " do find something, in a week you ll be slightly out of their jurisdiction. Come on, we ve got to get drunk immediately.
And drinking it. It s like Evian by the time it s filtered.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
It s okay, Eugene.
What car? Go to sleep.
Any particular reason?
What are you talking about?
They found my eyelash.
In a corridor.
I m not going anywhere. Less than a week to go. Not on your life
Where is your head, Jerome? You re acting like a guilty man. They won t marry the eyelash to you. They won t believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
You re the one who said not to change anything. She s my ear to the investigation.
I ve got enough on my mind without that.
I don t feel too good. I think I m still drunk from last night.
Complicated. I couldn t stop her apologizing.
You know how it is with these altered births somebody told her she s not going to live forever and she s been preparing to die ever since.
Of course not. But she s have to know eventually.
I m sorry. I ve got plans.
She s already got her doubts. I have to act like nothing s wrong.
You may as well invite her here.
Don t worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I m looking forward to having the place to myself.
How long?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
Not bad, Jerome.
Have you forgotten? I don t need any samples where I m going.
In case you get back before I do.
German, is that you?
I hope he s not just a body.
How do I square the accident?
I d have to bleach my hair.
Even with lifts I m never that tall.
I ve been asked to compile a log for the investigators they want to know everyone s whereabouts last night.
I was at home.
Yes.
No.
Why would we do that?
We were just looking.
Friend?
They found an eyelash.
In the South Wing.
Yes... yes...
You ll be next.
What exactly is wrong?
Let s walk.
Come on.
You remember the 99 Chrysler LeBaron? It s the exact height of the front fender. Looked right instead of left.
But " if it came to it " then it couldn t have your nose. How perfect does your child have to be?
There s a problem, Lamar.
I can t do this.
I m not doing it.
Not like this one.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
I get my own help.
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
Beynon.
And you got him...
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
You still don t get the picture do you? I ve always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
I knew that life didn t add up to the obvious when I was 8.
One. The radio s rappin about  750  000. We only got a half a million.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
No. My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
Hi.
My license expired, let s get out of here.
Yeah.
What do you mean? You ve never been there.
I ve been doing my homework.
Better than old times.
I made a mistake. I ll never make another one.
Assumed name... Houston.
That Beynon s got a long arm.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
Fatter... some things never change.
Nothing s been boring since you found me.
After four years and now the question comes up.
It s all right.
Listen, I m just as nervous as you are.
You were asleep.
Is he straight?
I couldn t have... much longer.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn t enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I m happy just loving you.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
Usually on the right side as you go in.
For exits off Main Street.
If it s funny I m going to laugh.
Waiting s hard. You never learn how.
At least you were outside.
Bullshit.
I know you do. But it is different. It s different. We ll be all right tomorrow.
We re going to have a lot of those, We re just going to get the money and then go all the way.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we ll leave his cut here
There are three men dead.
He might be ready to chop us up.
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn t try a cross until he s got the money.
If we make a mistake., he ll burn us. You make a deal, you re always better keeping your end up.
There wasn t any way to explain it.
You sent me to him.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
She s on TV.
What do we do?
And switched keys.
Fifteen minutes.
I wouldn t worry Doc. I can always get you out... I ll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
I can handle it.
You don t like the way things are, I don t like the way things
Maybe we should split up... I ll cut the money with you.
You ve got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
No... there s a couple of things I m still working on.
Why, there s nothing on the news?
When are you going to learn?
I don t want to hear it.
I don t think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
We ve come a lot of miles. But we re not close to anything.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
You want to try with me?
You and me.
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
Great. I m going to sleep twelve hours.
Oh, Jesus... how?
I ll be ready.
What s wrong?
Get in the shower. You ll feel okay.
Laughlin. He s always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
Who was it?
Where do we go from here?
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Hell, I don t know... but we sure gave it a run.
Yeah, why not? We re the good guys.
Utah, the Bee Hive state. I m from Orem, right near Salt Lake... Say, you wouldn t happen to be a Mormon, would you?
Me, neither. There s about twelve people in the state that aren t Mormons and I m one of them.
No, I m afraid not.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Oh my God.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Sure can. I d like an Invicta 12 gauge pump with the twenty inch barrel.
Two boxes of double ought buck.
Where?
You were with him?
I worked ten years without one, I don t need one now.
Okay. How many bank exits?
What about the vault?
Wire pull over?
I m good at that.
Aren t we going a little hard?
It s just a walk in bank. You don t have to be Dillinger for this one.
Growing all of them every day. 318, you ll be the only ones on the floor.
Just sandwiches...
He took the day off.
Just fine.
Mexico. I d like to find a quiet place to cross.
Juarez Chihuahua City road.
What s it to you?
' Bout five thousand.
You serious?
And I keep my mouth shut?
I don t report the car and I don t know either of you?
Wish you hadn t said that. When Slim Canfield s lips are sealed, they re sealed.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
That right?
How long have you been married?
Can he trust you?
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You ll feel better then...
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I ll kill you.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
How?
When did you find out?
How?
Who?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he s rumbled. Somehow, he s seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat. I thought they d just duff him up a bit. Honest.
Nothing. What could I do?
Yes. I told him.
What happened to this car?
This is my brother s car.
Yeah.
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
I know.
What?
What about?
Yes.
What name?
Why?
Why?
Christ, what...
Jack, you re wrong.
Good evening.
That s nice.
That s very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank? What happens if I miss the train?
I can t Jack. How can I?
Who sent you, Thorpey?
He s got a new place at Burnham.
Fine... I want to talk to you.
What do you mean? You ve been Frank s bird ever since her mother cleared off. You re closer to her than anyone.
I must go. I m in a hurry.
I can t.
He was all right to me.
Nicer than most.
Yes.
Yes. I can t help the way I am.
Once a week?
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Look, I m me, right. You re not. We are what we are, like it or not. Why all the bloody needle?
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
What?
I work for him.
Who?
Oh, do you?
Go on.
Really?
Really?
While he was here. You went about together?
Was he?
Yeah, I ll do you a favour.
No. I didn t know that.
So where are we going, Princess?
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Nasty.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
Brumby.
Entertaining.
Not entirely. No.
You ve been watching the film.
What girl?
I don t know.
Shouldn t think so.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Expect so.
The girl s name was Doreen. That s all I know.
No.
Nice of you to come.
Don t worry. She s bound to be upset.
No. It s all right.
Yeah.
I left last year.
Working at Woolworths.
Yeah.
At me friend s house.
Wilton Estate.
What?
Did you work with him, Keith?
That s what I was wondering.
Why would it?
Since when did he drink whisky?
Right.
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Old Thorpey? Haven t seen him in a long time.
That s nice. What d you tell him?
Where you off to?
How many?
Who s Brumby?
Yeah.
No. You bastard. You knew they d come back.
Get knotted.
I see.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
Definitely.
Very nice. I ll pay you for tonight as well.
My brother, Frank.
Funny. Can I phone London?
I m sorry.
No. Really, I am.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I ll tell you. I might even let you watch.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you ve been great about the...
They came back?
You re lucky. They kill as well.
That little shit!
What about Keith?
Pension him off.
What s that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there s a bloke staying in my hotel who s planning to shoot somebody?
How d you know I wouldn t?
What s that supposed to mean?
No.
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast, Did you sleep well?
No. Are you tired?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
Not much.
And that ll make me feel better?
Jack Carter.
What you doing around here then?
No, I didn t know that.
No. I m visiting relatives.
It would be. If they were still living.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Very... So, who you working for these days Eric?
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
I ve always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I m nosy.
Making a living.
Still got a sense of humour?
You should have told me who you were working for.
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it s all girls together, is it?
Sit down, Jack, I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I ll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them, Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Yep.
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
Yeah.
I have to. Things to see to.
We ve got to take you back to London.
They do that up North.
Knock it off, Gerald.
You re bluffing, you bastard!
That s right, Harry.
That, Harry? That s another hundred twenty five pounds notes of the realm.
That s right.
... Polacks...
... they hold on to their money...
I m not?
I had to.
To get on the...
I d never try to sell an Indian.
Mmm...
Well, I think I had one once.
What?
They came in and they, you know...
They killed the goose.
And now...
We re stuck with this fucking shit...
It s too...
Eh?
You get a bad month, all of a...
All of, they got you on this " board... "
Some contest board...
I know it s not. I ll tell you, you got, you know, you got... what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don t sell a guy one car. Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
Eh...?
Goddamn right, that s right. Guys come on: " Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I ll do: I ll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before. "
Eh?
And so they kill the goose. I, I, I ll... and a fuckin man, worked all his life has got to...
For some fuckin " Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives... "
... sales promotion, " You lose, then we fire your... " No. It s medieval... it s wrong. " Or we re going to fire your ass. " It s wrong.
Yes, it is. And you know who s responsible?
You know who it is. It s Mitch. And Murray. Cause it doesn t have to be this way.
Look at Jerry Graff. He s clean, he s doing business for himself, he s got his, that list of his with the nurses... see? You see? That s thinking. Why take ten percent? A ten percent comm... why are we giving the rest away? What are we giving ninety per... for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you " Get out there and close. " " Go win the Cadillac. " Graff. He goes out and buys. He pays top dollar for the... you see?
Nurses.
He is?
I heard that they were running cold.
Yes.
With River Oaks?
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there s lots of things.
No, it s not that simple, Dave...
What?
What hard part?
What?
That s right...
That s the truth...
Huh.
No.
You...
That s what I...
They...
When they...
What?
What?
What do you mean?
Yes...?
Someone should hurt them.
How?
Huh.
The Glengarry... the premium leads...? I d say we got five thousand. Five. Five thousand leads.
Yes.
Graff? Because I worked for him.
No, we re just...
We re just speaking about it. As an idea.
Yes.
Talking about it as a...
As a robbery.
Well. Well...
No. Not actually.
What did you say?
That s right. It s a crime. It is a crime. It s also very safe.
Did you talk to Graff?
What did he say?
What will he pay?
For five thousand?
You re saying " me. "
Is that what I said?
What?
You have to steal the leads tonight?
You re, you re saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
I m sorry?
I...
They ll know when you go over to Graff...
Yes.
What does that mean?
What if you don t get caught?
Why would they come to me?
Why would I do it?
No.
Yes. I m sure.
... and rob the place...
... they take me, then. They re going to ask me who were my accomplices.
Absolutely.
Well, to the law, you re an accessory. Before the fact.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
That s right.
You went for it.
So I m making it concrete.
Why? Why you going to give me five grand?
Is that what I just said?
Hey, hey, let s just keep it simple, what I need is not the... what do you need...?
I lied. Alright? My end is my business. Your end s twenty five. In or out. You tell me, you re out you take the consequences.
Uh huh.
Yeah. That s swell. Yes. You re right. How are you?
I don t... yes. Okay, the board.
Well, they re old. I saw the shit that they were giving you.
Huh?
They re ancient.
It s a waste of time.
That s...
That s not... Fuck that shit, George. You re a, hey, you had a bad month. You re a good man, George.
You hit a bad streak. We ve all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
He filed half of them, he filed the big one. All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and... ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the... I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone s self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where s the phones?
They stole the phones.
... what am I going to do all month...
To the cops?
Yeah. That s swell. Another waste of time.
Why? Cause they aren t going to find the guy.
Yes. The cops. No.
No.
Why? Because they re stupid. " Where were you last night... "
Where was I?
I was at home, where were you?
Was I?
No.
No.
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
No, who?
Why?
You think so?
Where did Moss...? I...
You understand?
No.
You...
Rick, I m going to flag a cab.
Excuse me, sir...
... did they...
Who told me wh...? You ve got a fuckin, you ve... a... who is this...? You ve got a board up on the window... Moss told me.
Please don t leave. I m going to talk to you. What s your name?
Levene!
I ve... look. Will someone get this guy off my back.
I m talking with Mr. Lingk. If you please, I ll be back in. I ll be back in a while... I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Could I...
Hey, fella, let s get this done...
You re done, come down, and let s...
And what if you don t close.
My ass. I told em. Listen to this: I said...
"... you have to believe in yourself... "
"... You look around, you say, This one has so and so, and I have nothing... "
" Why? Why don t I get the opportunities...? "
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
You sold eight Mountain View?
That s right.
They took the phones...
From the store.
" What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity... and take it. And that s it. " And we sit there. I got the pen out...
That s what I m saying. The old ways. The old ways... convert the motherfucker... sell him... sell him... make him sign the check. The... Bruce, Harriet... the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds... I say fuck it, we re going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units. Eighty two grand. I tell them. " This is now. This is that thing that you ve been dreaming of, you re going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that s full of money. This is it, Harriett... "
Like you taught me...
Yes. I did. This morning. What I m saying to you: things can change. You see? This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don t know. You can t look down the road. And see what s coming. Might be someone else, John. It might be someone new, eh? Someone new. And you can t look back. Cause you don t know history. You ask them. When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man? A month...? Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row. You know what that means? You know what that means? Is that luck? Is that some, some, some purloined leads? That s skill. That s talent, that s, that s...
... and you don t remember. Cause you weren t around. That s cold calling. Walk up to the door. I don t even know their name. I m selling something they don t even want. You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it... before we called it anything, we did it.
The hell with him. We ll go to lunch, the leads won t be up for...
What is it?
I just put Jim into Black Creek... are you acquainted with...
Yes.
Well, we ll do that this weekend.
Sure.
Which...
Uh...
Home cooking...
Oh! For the magazine...
Go ahead.
No, his wife is.
Twelve fifteen.
Didn t I say I was taking the two o...
Kenilworth...?
Kenilworth.
Me.
Mm.
Okay, okay, I ll be at the resta...
Did I...?
What do I...?
Mmmm...
Gimlet.
Lingk. James Lingk.
She called the consumer... the attorney, I don t know. The attorney gen... they said we have three days...
I don t know, the attorney gen... the... some consumer office, um...
Three days.
To change our minds.
But we have to before Monday. To get our money ba...
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
I m not.
But I m not counting it. Wednesday. Thursday. Friday. So it would have elapsed.
If we wait till Mon...
Yest...
Tuesday.
I don t know.
The check wasn t cashed?
It s not me, it s my wife.
I told you.
Tell me again. Your wife.
You tell me again.
We re going to speak to her.
We ll speak to her, Jim...
She told me I have to.
Where are you going...? This is me... This is Ricky, Jim. Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it. You understand? This is me. Something upset you. Sit down, now sit down. You tell me what it is. Am I going to help you fix it? You re goddamned right I am. Sit down. Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside. It s... no, sit down... Now talk to me.
What does that mean?
I...
I...
I don t have the power. I said it.
The power to negotiate.
This.
The " deal, " forget the deal. Forget the deal, you ve got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
She told me not to talk to you.
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State s att...
And the check is...
It s nothing.
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
You going to turn State s?
Fuck the Machine.
Fuckin cop s got no right talk to me that way. I didn t rob the place...
Yeah. He closed a deal.
Guess who?
Why not?
Who said " Fuck the Machine "?
Sittin on top of the world, sittin on top of the world, everything s fucking peachfuzz...
Who s my pal...? And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean? Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...? What are you, friend to the workingman? Big deal. Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin fly. I never liked you.
I m going home.
I m not going home. I m going to Wisconsin.
Yes.
I got lots of presents.
I didn t know the people who gave them to me.
No, where is it?
I m leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
Just a few days.
I can t.
To do business.
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
I m not hungry.
That s right.
The Corleone Family, Senator. We called it,  quot; The Family.  quot;
We have no money for a rug.
What? You read it in the papers?
That scar faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won t take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
You know his friends... real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he d like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that s how he operates. We ll have to pay. Three hundred, are we agreed?
He s going to kill Fanucci.
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late. This is for my Mama. You remember Merle?
How are the kids?
I got surprises for everybody!
This is swell. Where s Michael? I ve got things to get straight with him and I can t wait on line.
Connie.
I saw him with you.
Michael...
You re not my father!
Because I need MONEY!
No.
Tom is right.
The children can stay.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother in law Michael.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him. How come you re so scared of your own kid brother?
Dancing is alright; you re falling on the floor.
Deanna, I m going to belt you right in the mouth!
My two friends have my share of the money. I ll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
You must understand, this is all new to me...
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
I m a little short. I ve been out of work. Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
It s all right. He stays with me all the time.
We re making an investment in Havana.
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
Pentangeli s dead. He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers. Didn t you know that?
I want you to help me, Fredo.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
I d like to come along. There s been a lot of strain, and I ve been cooped up in this room for three days.
No.
It was hard to have him killed.
It was hard to have him killed.
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
You know otherwise, Freddie?
What s that?
Sincere. What are you talking about, of course I m sincere with you, Mike.
Mike, are you crazy, I m your brother.
... Who?
But, you told me yourself...
What do you want me to do?
What is it? Can I help?
We have time.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
And you believed that story.
I ve always taken care of you.
It s the way Pop wanted it.
There s nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
He s an Italian?
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone? What do you think of my angel?
Beautiful.
What?
No, I didn t know. Is he dead?
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
Why?
And he agreed?
Chi?
I m supposed to stay in my house.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
I m going to see my parents.
How long does this go on?
Am I a prisoner?
Kay... Kay...
You don t know that s true. But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let s assume it is, I m not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
Okay, just hear me out. What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed? What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what? And what if the Don, a great man, couldn t bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son s death by killing his daughter s husband? What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
If he were, he d be dead by now. You d be a widow. You d have no problem.
When is it finally over? I want it to be over before my baby is born.
We don t know that s true, he never said that.
Talk to him. Tell him how you feel.
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat. Rocco tried to say she wasn t in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride. That was three hours ago.
Yes.
I know. I went down to the Barrett house. But she s gone. They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
Two thirty. That gives me time to see my boy.
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don t think...
Will we... be able to get who ordered it out of them?
But if you re wrong...
I took care of it.
Roth got out on a private boat. He s in a hospital in Miami. Had a stroke but he s recovered okay. Bussetta s dead.
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth s brother, Sam. The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I m not sure, but I think he s somewhere in New York.
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping. Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
Wait... there s something else.
Mike, at three and a half...
It was a boy.
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
His medical condition is reported as...  quot; terminal.  quot;
That plane goes to Miami...
Mike, it s impossible. He ll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there s no way we can get to him.
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
I turned Houstan down; I didn t see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down. Are you sure, Mikey? Are you sure of what we re doing; what we ll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
Why do you hurt me, Michael? I ve always been loyal to you.
No questions.
Al, as far as you re concerned, I m the Don.
I m sorry, Mrs. Corleone. We re not to let you through.
If you could just give us a list, we ll pick up anything you want.
This is my boy, and my wife. Mr. John Ola of Miami.
Sleeping inside me.
Yes, Michael, it does.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada. Also, the children Michael, they re here.
In a minute. They re outside with Esther. I m very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you re simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
I m not going to stay long; I can t.
I think it s too late for changes, Michael. I promised myself I wouldn t talk about it and I ve gone and spoiled it.
Tell me, Michael. What really happened with Pentangeli?
I didn t even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
And that s all he had to do. Just show his face.
You would have killed his brother?
I ll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
Goodbye, Michael.
Michael.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it s pity. For the first time since I ve known you, you seem so helpless. You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all. I never thought that could happen, but it has.
The baby I lost...
Who s asking?
Right here.
Who do you think you re talking to?
You don t come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
I m alright. Will you stay home for awhile?
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight. How are your eyes?
You talk about the baby. She can have another baby.
Your family? How can you ever lose your family?
Not for a few years.
Yes.
The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I m going to do with you, just in case.
You re a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
Then it s done. I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
We re making a big investment in Cuba. That s my only concern.
The money was sent.
I wouldn t consider anyone else.
Still no word of your courier? We ll find him. But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You ve been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he ll come.
I ve read it; I m pleased that the government is doing so well. As a heavy investor, I m pleased. How did the doctor find you?
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
Very impressive.
So?
How is his health?
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
He s very kind, tell him it s appreciated. I m sure it will be profitable all the way around.
Let him gamble.
And?
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn t she stay. As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
How much more a month?
Yes.
What was that?
I say let loverboy watch his movie. And be grateful Boone s not cutting Shirley Temple s lawn.
Just thinking out loud.
All right, then. He s interested in you for your conversation. We know what a great talker you are.
Not anymore you don t. Doll.
Maybe it s supposed to be funny.
What s to be jealous of?
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
It means it s too cold to go swimming. And I don t mean the water.
Do you realize you re more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
It never crossed your mind?
Hey, no strings, right? That s what you always said. Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
I didn t mean to...
You liked it too.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
I m not a kid.
Is that all this conversation means to you? Am I going to put out or not?
I m keeping away. What you are doing is no business of mine.
What kind of man are you? Are you a good man?
You will not hurt him?
No. No. I am sorry. Forget everything I say. Here. I will take the tray.
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch. I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
Long enough. Fifteen years.
No. We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I. People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim. You have people, Boone?
Your wife?
Why?
A man who is not married has nothing. He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
Of course. I am married still.
He is dead now, twenty years.
No. I have children, grandchildren too. I visit when I can. But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much. Poor Mr. Jimmy. There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell. Very sad.
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
A homo?
You re telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
Well... no, not really
No!
I m not going to hurt anyone.
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go. We are having a guest for breakfast.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
What do I do?
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
But I didn t do this!
We have his note.
But how re you going to explain this? How did you get him out of the pool?
Mornin.
Nice place.
Boone. Clayton Boone.
Just that I was in the Marines.
I stink to high heaven right now.
No. Iced tea s fine.
What? Oh yes.
You know what they say. If you have to ask
They were familiar when I painted them. That one s copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago. And that s a Rembrandt.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were. Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood. No, I was merely a director here.
This and that. The only ones you maybe have heard of are the " Frankenstein " pictures.
I made only the first two. The others were done by hacks.
What did she mean by going flooey?
What was wrong?
Huh?
You mean, like posed for pictures?
What s to sketch?
Broke is more like it.
Football in college.
Just a year. I dropped out to join the Marines.
You mean you really want to draw me?
But why?
And it s just my head you want? Nothing else?
You don t want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
You don t say? Which picture?
It s new.
I m not wearing an undershirt.
But it s just my face you want to draw.
No. I m fine.
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
Your family ate dripping?
What?
We weren t rich. But we weren t poor either.
I guess you d say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
All right, I guess.
This David s a friend?
Did you now?
Did anyone laugh?
Pity. People are so earnest nowadays.
I don t like to talk about that.
Proud? Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
No. I could have, though.
Full up. I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
Can t today.
Sorry. I don t feel like sitting still today.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
No, I you re a homosexual.
I m not, you know.
You don t think of me that way, do you?
You know. Look at me like like I look at women.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
It will only make you self conscious. You ll have to remove your shirt.
But we have to match the other sketch.
I m fine. I d just rather keep it on.
Not at the moment.
You know how it is. You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
The world is just one kiss ass game after another. A man has to make up his own life, alone.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
What happened?
Do you miss it?
You ve done a helluva lot more than most people.
How long were you...?
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no
You first.
I don t know. I guess I like your stories.
Not me.
Not fear. More like disgust.
There s no people like you in my crowd.
You must think the whole world is queer. Well it s not. War sure isn t.
You re talking through your hat now.
You were a soldier?
I didn t
You re the one who started it.
You asked me to model. Remember?
I don t get it. First you creep me out with homo shit. Then you hit me with war stories. And now you re upset because I listen? What do you want?
No harm done.
I m game. Sure.
If that s okay?
I don t hear anything.
David. The friend I thought was in New York.
Actually, no. I feel a little out of place.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Run for what?
You don t want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
Just a night out. Sounds like she can t say no to her daughter.
Ten minutes ago. Didn t you hear me calling?
You don t have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
Do I have any other choice?
I thought you d given up on my picture.
Never gave it much thought.
But you said
The Great War?
A very lucky thing indeed.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father s sake?
What happened?
I m very sorry.
" A perfect night for mystery and horror. The air itself is filled with monsters. "
I don t remember that one.
I don t recall. Memories of the war, perhaps.
Oh, but it does. Especially in light of the journey I m about to make.
You survived it. It can t hurt you now. It s no good to dig it up.
What won t do?
What did you expect? Bronze?
For the artistic effect. The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask. It s quite striking.
Please, Clayton. Just for a minute. Long enough for me to see the effect.
What was that?
I haven t done a damn thing with you!
Oh Clayton.
Nothing I didn t deserve.
You ll feel better tomorrow.
Fuck off!
If you don t believe me, let s watch this movie. See if his name s on it. How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
It s the ridiculous pills they prescribe. If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don t, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once
" The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars. "
Thank you.
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
You didn t, Jimmy.
You only embarrass yourself.
You know what I mean. Your reputation.
Well the rest of us aren t. Can t you remember that?
Then who did?
Yes. Perfectly.
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne. But from the neck up? What s my story there?
You re saying there s an electrical storm in my head?
But the rest of it? The killing headaches. The phantom smells. My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It s all nothing more than bad electricity?
So what do I do?
Yes, Mr. Jimmy. An interview. After so many years. Very exciting.
I do not think you anything anymore. Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
Yes, yes, yes. I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We ll have a brief chat and he ll finish the yard.
I ll be fine, Hanna. Thank you.
I d hardly call our yardman a friend.
I have my family. Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
I ll be out this afternoon, remember? Your family can visit as long as they like.
No. I expect you can t.
One likes to live simply.
Sure.
Everything. Start at the beginning.
Your father was a schoolmaster?
How much longer before we get to " Frankenstein "?
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all
I don t mind.
It is, isn t it? My life as a game of strip poker. Shall we play?
Quite.
What rumors might those be?
Certainly, Mr. Kay. Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Of course.
Maybe you d like a swim when we re through. I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
Who came up with the Monster s makeup and look?
He s one of the great images of the twentieth century. As important as the Mona Lisa.
I m sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
Bet you thought you d never see me again. I didn t know if you d be well enough to come to this party.
I m the one who got you on Mr. Cukor s guest list.
I interviewed him after I met you. I m his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
Don t think that, Mr. Whale. I love your movies. That s why I wanted you to come to this. So I could see you with your monsters.
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you...
I knew you d say that.
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five zero. For that he gets 200 large...
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community...
One more night
This is number 50. We did it. It s over Where s the money?
What do you mean?
You got no choice. It s over.
No... And they won t take my calls...
You guys are through...
" Carol. " A 198 Mercedes... She lives in the suburbs...
It s ear marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
What do you say, Toby?,
Yeah... You want a ride...
How d you get here? Your Moms give you ride?
You boosted a Vette? Then where is it?
Yeah...
I think so. There s things I can t feel right now. Like my feet. But... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I d appreciate it
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car crusher?
Totally. I m fine. You want a beer, man?
Yeah
Something like that
About what?
About Calitri? No worries, man. I ll call him. He s a reasonable dude...
C mon, man... My " demise... " Overreaction
Hey, now
I can handle it
I can handle it
I can handle it
Me.
I like how you wallop back in here after four years and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit...
" Shadow games? "
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
Thank you...
The family that steals together, deals together...
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
The era when crime didn t pay
Price of doing business...
Nah.
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
What?
What?
I know...
I saw her get smashed up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her...
Ya gotta keep tabs on your " Eleanors ", Memphis. Cos you never know when you re gonna need one
Hell, yeah. She s not my unicorn.
Sure, man
What for?
Hospital.
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
Hell, yeah. I m not getting rich in here...
Mitch.
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive... You left me, remember?
A distinction worth noting...
Yes. But I got a feeling it s not on account of any longing for my touch on your part
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
Six or seven...
What s wrong with her?
She was the only " Annie " you could find?
That what you want?
Very good...
No way...
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
I think so... They re just... So...
I take out my slim jim...
You re going high cheese, dude
" Unlock my button "...?
Woo woo wooooo!
They re factory alarms... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
Cut em...
Of course you are. You re a professional...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
Wrong preposition...
What about The Club...?
No worries...
How is he?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
What s that?
Hello, Otto...
The chop shop... Where are the stripped cars? The rolled back odometers? The part bins?
Are you considering a comeback tour?
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I ll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip s jerk circus didn t undo Castlebeck s linkage so much so that he s setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
" A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men Yes, and then to get around them... " Nietzsche said that.
The old crew. Go find them. I can t help you with that. Since I ve cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular
And the moral of that story is?
No we don t
His criminal career has officially come to a close...
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on...
He s gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
Who s " Eleanor? "
Why do you call it " Eleanor? "
So she flies
So what s in there?
You ll be at the docks... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress...
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man...
Not really
Not really
Not
Why you gotta front me like that? I m talking to Kip
I known Kip longing than you, man...
Look at Jeannie s kid.
The oldest one. He was in an argument. A lousy ten dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he s been arrested. She has a heart attack. She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie s got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
Billy, how are you?
Listen to him. " Watch the suit, " he says. A little pisser I ve known all my life. Hey, Tommy, don t go get too big.
No more shines, Billy.
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
Wha? Me?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
Nods.
Nods again.
I ve been all fucked up since I got out.
It was easy money. I did it in the can. Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
But, Paulie, I m sorry. Believe me. I was fucking crazy. But I m okay now. I can be trusted. I m clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
Have more coffee. It ll wake you up.
She s screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes. I remember she s screaming, but mostly I m looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor s. That s what everybody said.
I m in construction.
What are you gonna do?
What bag?
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
I m just having my last few drinks.
What are you talking about?
Jezuz Christ!
It ll be okay.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
I can t do it anymore.
I m afraid. I m afraid if Paulie finds out.
I don t want to hear about her anymore.
With what?
But you ve got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and I promised we d take Judy to F. A. O. Schwarz.
She s beautiful. Look at her. Henry, look at her.
What did he say, exactly?
Safe? Here? They ll kill me here. They re all afraid I m gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I m dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Where s the stuff?
You know. The stuff I left.
You what?
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand. I need it. I was depending on that money.
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
I got seared.
Paulie was just talking about him.
What?
It s been six months.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
What lions? I m not going near any lions.
Jimmy.
I gotta talk to you.
What s going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
There are cops all over the place.
Come on, don t fuck around, will ya?
Nah.
He was jumpy. He hadn t touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all. On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
How?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Done.
He heard.
I can t make any more deliveries.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Jesus! You must think I m dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I ve been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
I don t care. I need my hat. I won t go without it.
I don t give a shit. That guy s got no right.
He s insulting me. Rat bastard. He s never been any fuckin good.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
No, no. It s okay.
Don t start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It s a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this. There s enough powder around here to put us all away.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
It s okay. I ll make it up. I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
He s okay. They sobered him up.
Jimmy. I don t know. I got so much else on my mind. I got the kids. We got no money.
He says he s too hot. He doesn t even know I came here today. It s like he s crazy. Jimmy.
I got dry cleaning.
I don t want them left back.
But I m worried. I m hearing all kinds of things. Paulie. You know me all my life. I ve always done the right thing.
But it isn t right, Paulie. That Tommy, he s making trouble for me all over town. I can t go here. I can t go there.
But, Paulie, please.
Paulie, I swear, I m afraid. The guy s nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I ll do.
Yeah.
What? Come on!
Oh shit.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Suck my cock!
All right, then.
What are we gonna do up there?
Probation, counselin, few days a week.
Why not?
What do I look like, Al Cowlins? You want to take my car, drop her off?
Gone.
She went to Medical school in California.
Oh I m sure, that s why only one of us has herpes.
Week after I m twenty one.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Yeah, be a fuckin lab rat.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Chuckie, what are you talkin...
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don t want to?
You don t know that.
No, I had to talk him down.
Ah, history I think.
How you doin?
What? No. This is my mother s house. I don t live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I m good like that.
She ll live. If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
You caught that, huh?
What Morgan, you re not gonna go talk to her?
All right Morgan, fine. I ll tell you why we re not going to " Kelly s. " It s because the take out bitch is a fuckin idiot. I m sorry you like her but she s dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
So why don t you give me my sandwhich?
Yah, all right...
I told you, I just got change.
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
Shut up.
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin knows? So the cop goes " Stay here " And he goes runnin down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty s standin on the side of the road for a little while, and he s so fuckin lit, that he forgets what he s waitin for. So he goes, " Fuck it. " He gets in his car and drives home.
Why don t you beat off at your house?
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin router you think sanded out all that bondo?
Retainer...
I have about seventy three...
History.
Good, it was all right.
Well, you d be working on the cutting edge. You d be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn t see anywhere else because we ve classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms
That s one aspect of what we do.
That s exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn t " why should you work for N. S. A. " it s " why shouldn t you? "
Seven.
Somethin s in my room.
Down there. And I m nervous.
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree
Yeah, can I help you?
No students work for me.
Which one s your building?
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can t give you his name unless you have a complaint.
What re you doing?
Hey fuck you.
Fuck do you want?
Really?
What re those?
That s right.
Of course.
I think so.
Half red, half black
Half red, half black
Oh, come on! You re not pinnin this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin fun.
Okay... don t forget to get another therapist for next week.
I don t know what it s called.
That s fine, but did you ever think
Will, what happened at the Tri tech meeting?
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don t show up it reflects poorly on me.
I ll cancel every meeting right now. I ll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
Hey, how you doin?
I was just sayin goodbye to Sean.
I just want you to know... It s been a pleasure.
Listen, I ll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don t be afraid to give me a call.
Yes.
It s Saturday.
Find out what?
Uh oh.
Yeah, cured polio.
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
Good to see you.
I ve been busy.
Since Nancy died.
This kid s special, Sean. I ve never seen anything like him.
That s right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan s genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he s very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
I need someone with your kind of background.
You re from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
Just meet with the boy once a week.
I ll be okay.
Tom.
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
To show me he doesn t have to talk to me if he doesn t want to.
Not at all.
I live right around the corner.
I think so.
We haven t really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone s been ringing off the hook with job offers.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will s is given free reign.
Sean, I really don t think you understand
Who?
I do.
Look, I don t know what else I can say. I m not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy s life. But it s important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty three years to do something worthy of a Field s medal.
Now wait a minute, Gerry
Personal rivalry? I m not getting back at you.
Is it Gerry? Cause I don t think it s fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
Now wait a minute
Gerry
Hold on!
I know what I m doing and I know why I m here!
" Undermine? "
He is at a fragile point. He s got problems
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn t he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It s called loyalty!
And who do you think he s handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he s been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it s going to be the same thing all over again. And I m not going to let that happen to him!
I m not angry at you
I don t have any anger at you
That s it. That s why I don t come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can t stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I m a failure! I know who I am. I m proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I m some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
I don t want your trophy and I don t give a shit about it! Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply faced and didn t know what side of the bed to piss on!
I don t blame you! It s not about that! It s about the boy! Cause he s a good kid! And I won t see this happen to him I won t see you make him feel like a failure too!
If you push him into something, if you ride him
Come in.
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I d travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
I don t know. India maybe.
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty five is having this event in six months.
I don t know... Gotta be at least four to one.
You re pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
What s the point?
There is somebody...
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Had one, now I m fucked again.
Have you read all these books, Will?
What did you think?
I did.
How about Noam Chomsky s " Manufacturing Consent? "
You think so?
Nautilus?
285.
No.
This is a real piece of shit.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn t really concern me.
The color here, see how dark it is? It s interesting.
I think you re one step away from cutting your ear off.
You ever heard the saying, " any port in a storm? "
Well, maybe that means you.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven t thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
You re just a boy. You don t have the faintest idea what you re talking about.
You ve never been out of Boston.
You ve never been on a plane.
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
Fine.
I don t know.
Haven t called her.
I know what I m doing. She s different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She s smart, beautiful, fun...
Why? So I can realize she s not so smart. That she s boring. You don t get it. Right now she s perfect, I don t want to ruin that.
You ever think about gettin remarried?
Hence, the word remarried.
No, I don t.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
I didn t write anything else cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Yeah.
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don t regret a singel day I spent with her.
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty five thousand fans on their feet, screamin at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin up the baseline, wavin at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn t one of them.
I was havin a drink with my future wife.
That s right.
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
" I gotta go see about a girl "? What did they say?
You re kiddin me.
I don t know.
I guess.
What?
Define that.
Not to me, they re not.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
Oh, what? You re going to take the professor s side on this?
I didn t want the job.
I didn t ask for this.
Why is it a cop out? I don t see anythin wrong with layin brick, that s somebody s home I m buildin. Or fixin somebody s car, somebody s gonna get to work the next day cause of me. There s honor in that.
If you won t answer my questions, you re wasting my time.
That s right. And you fuckin lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way. And it s between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
No. Have you had any experience with that?
No, have you had any experience with that?
I used to go with the wrench.
It s not your fault.
It s not your fault.
It s not your fault.
It s not your fault.
It s not your fault.
It s not...
Over at Tri tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven t told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
Yeah, I think so.
Thanks you. So, that s it? We re done?
You re Welcome, Will.
Does this violate the patient / doctor relationship?
What?
I m Will.
I kind of got that impression.
I didn t mean you. Listen, maybe...
What?
What?
See, it s my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick up line.
It s Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
Okay, you got me. It s the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn t leave you alone all night.
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
Is Harvard gettin all that money?
So you just want to use me and go?
In that case, fine. Want to see my magic trick?
No.
You know what I mean. I know you ve at least thought about it.
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
Yes you were.
No... I was hoping to get a kiss.
Not far from here, South Boston.
You know, nothing special.
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
You wouldn t believe me if I told you.
Not a chance.
Bullshit.
Your house must have been a zoo.
Do you know all their names?
Well...
Do you keep in touch with them?
I m sorry, I been real busy.
Sorry. I m sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
How the hell did you do that?
I m supposed to understand this.
No.
' Cause it s nicer than my place.
Exactly.
They don t come over here that much.
Aah, it s kind of a hike.
All right, all right. We ll go.
Sometime. I don t know. Next week.
Fine.
No.
It s important that I learn this.
Clearly.
Rich? I have an inheritance. It s two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That s exactly what it ll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I m doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
I guess. I don t know. How do you remember your phone number?
Some, a little.
I guess so.
Like me?
Come one Will. I just want to know.
I see " Hot Cross Buns, " but okay.
So, do you play the piano?
But you can do my O chem lab in under an hour, you can
No.
What?
How do you know that?
Yeah, but how do you know?
And you re sure about that?
' Cause that s a serious thing you re sayin. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin about me that you don t like. And you might feel like " hey this is a big mistake. " But you can t take it back, cause you know it s real serious and you can t take somethin like that back. Now I m in California, cause you asked me to come. But you don t really want me there. And I m stuck in California with someone who really doesn t want me there and just wishes they had a take back.
I can t go out to California.
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here
I m not sayin I m not in love with you.
What do you mean " What am I afraid of? "
What am I scared of?
Don t tell me about my world. You re the one that s afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry
Some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you ll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin too.
At least you have a mother.
What the fuck am I afraid of?!
I m not honest?
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don t really have any brothers? That I m a fuckin orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
No, you don t want to hear that.
What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says " save me " on my back?
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
How bout you?
But ain t no reason
Okay. I think you re a darn fool, though.
We re goin to California, ain t we? Awright then, let s  go  to California.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin scared?
Naw. They paroled me.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Gallon or two?
I guess that s what he looked like.
What d he look like again?
Was he bruised up this mornin? About the face?
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream and apple.
What s it to you?
Riot? I don t see no riot. Who re you?
Got a warrant?
Joad. Tom Joad.
We ll work it out. What s this committee you talkin about?
Are you aimin to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus fellas campin here?
An you say no cops?
I can t hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out the deputies an some of them poolroom fellas.
You got dances too?
Say, who runs this place?
Why ain t they more like it?
Anything like work aroun here?
Ma s shore gonna like it here. She ain t been treated decent for a long time.
Crate fell on me.
Yeah. On my way home now.
Why, you re the preacher!
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
Have a little snort?
Ought to be. That s fact ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
Didn t you hear? It was in the papers.
I been in the penitentiary for four years.
I don t mind any more. I d do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
He had a knife in me. That s why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four parole.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
I ll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin, an he had one a the bigges doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin over bushes, howlin like a dog wolf in moon time. Fin ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an he let out a squawk an took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin dentist there and he set her, an I give her a prayin over, but they wasn t no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
They never wrote you nothing?
I ain t no preacher anymore.
What you figger to do?
We know. But ain t none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
I ain t gonna run.
You re right!
Casy! What you doin here?
Thought you was in jail.
I dunno. Payin five now.
I aim to.
Try an tell em, Tom. They ll get two an a half, jus the minute we re gone. An you know what that is? That s one ton a peaches picked an carried for a dollar. That way you can t even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is  ripe . Two days out an they ll pay  all  of us five!
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa s gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma s gonna starve that baby jus cause a bunch a fellas is yellin outside a gate?
Women is always tar d.
No, but but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don t pay nothin. Jus send em the coupon an you re a radio expert nice clean work.
Save your strength, lady. Get goin, buddy. No campin here.
Want to work, do you?
Pull up behind that car. Okay for this one. Take em through.
Then what are you doin this kind a thing for against your own people?
But this is  my land , son. Don t you understand?
Just a few miles. I d a walked her if my dogs wasn t pooped out.
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He s a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
Yeah.
Why don t you get to it, buddy?
You know what I mean. You been givin me a goin over ever since I got in. Whyn t you go on and ask me where I been?
Naw not much!
Listen. That big nose of yours been goin over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain t keepin it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Me neither. I m just tryin to get along without shovin anybody around, that s all. See that road up ahead?
What you mean?
You been acrost?
If we broke down maybe somebody d give us a han.
This here s a strike.
Fi cents! They pain you fi cents?
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
Didn you have no breakfast?
I ain t talkin about you, I m talkin about me. And I m a stayin. I give her a good goin over all night long and I m a stayin.
Ain t a goin, thas all...

No plants.
Thought I d take a walk. Any law against it?
You mean I can t even get outa here?
Whatta ya mean? You ain t et today.
You take that plate inside the tent an you eat it.
Now don t you go gettin nimsy mimsy.
Well, can t nobody get through nine  months  without sorrow.
They use to be a sayin: A chile born outa sorrow ll be a happy chile. An another: Born outa too much joy ll be a doleful boy. That s the way I always heard it.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain t scairt so much. It s just waitin an wonderin. But when sump n happens that I got to do sump n I ll do it.
Why, sure. It won t be so bad once we get her washed out.
No m.
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way makes folks sort of giggly an happy.
An you won t let nobody touch me?
Cut it out, Ma, or I ll
Now don t get sassy, Ma.
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an never will be
We  got  to, Tommy. But that s gonna be awright. I seen the han bills, about how much work they is, an high wages, too. But I gotta fin out somepin else first, Tommy. Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an make you mean mad?
Sometimes they do.
Sometimes they do somethin to you, Tommy. They hurt you and you get mad and then you get mean and they hurt you again and you get meaner, and meaner till you ain t no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin chunk a mean mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
Don t taste bad.
Your pa tol me you didn t ought to cross it if you re paroled. Says they ll send you up again.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don t know about. Crimes we don t even know  is  crimes.
Ya say we re acrost?
Thank God! An we re still together most of us.
No.
Granma s dead.
Since before they stopped us las night.
Tom you tol me you promised you wasn t like that. You promised me.
You promised, Tommy.
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly s breakin up. You  got  to keep clear.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
Busted my cheek but I can still see. What d you hear?
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
They killed Casy first.
They know what this fella looks like?
I m sorry, Ma. But I didn t know what I was doin, no more n when you take a breath. I didn t even know I was gonna do it.
I m gonna go away tonight. I can t go puttin this on you folks.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
I could hide you, Tommy.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
He was a good man.
Tommy, they ll drive you, an cut you down like they done to Casy.
You don t aim to kill nobody, Tom!
How m I gonna know bout you? They might kill you an I wouldn t know. They might hurt you. How m I gonna know?
Then what, Tom?
I don t understan it, Tom.
Good by, Tom. Later when it s blowed over you ll come back? You ll try to fin us?
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma am.
I know, ma am... on y it s for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof n it with water so she can chew it, an she s hongry.
I shore would like to do that, ma am, but the fack is, we ain t got but a dime for it. It s all figgered out, I mean for the trip.
I don t wanta rob you, ma am.
Muley! Where s my folks, Muley?
But what s happened? How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years same place.
But who done it?
Are you crazy?
But it don t seem possible kicked off like that!
Hide out for what? We ain t doin nothin.
Won t they come out here?
But we couldn t  do  on any less n what our share is now. The chillun ain t gettin enough to eat as it is, and they re so ragged we d be shamed if ever body else s chillun wasn t the same way.
Brother, I don t know. If I did I d tell you. But I just don t know  who s  to blame!
Sol things, chopped cotton even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol. Shucked out seventy five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
Can t tie him. Either we ll hurt him or he ll git so mad he ll hurt his self. Reckon we could git him  drunk ?
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin his name is there with im, not just a old fella lonesome underground.
I ain t got nothin in  my  han.
Think I ll walk out an try to fin out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
We gonna stay, ain t we?
If this don t beat all! Well, I see you been busy already!
Tom, I jus don t feel like nothin a tall. Without him I jus don t wanta live.
I wisht it was day.
Man bones?
Whatsa matter?
Keep qui te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear? But lissen here. I won t tell nobody, y understan?
Morning.
Mister, we re lookin even under boards for work.
We can pick anything.
Ain t gonna be no trouble.
Awright. An if she gets outa han, I ll be in the right han corner, this side the dance floor.
Yes I do.
In the corporate offices.
Yeah...
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
It s what I do.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those
Wonderful.
What?
Computer guy.
I sell BMW s. What do you do?
What?
Really...? So what?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
What do you want to do?
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
I m in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That s about it, really.
Not much else.
I m a professional killer.
Where have I been?
I don t know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7 11
And I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don t know. Anyway, this whole thing s my therapist s idea. It s my shrink, really.
You see someone?
No. I m not going. Is that why you re here?
Well, you ll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Well, there s not much to tell.
Bad experiences.
Bad people.
Bad television.
What s that?
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Unbelievable.
Yes.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
As long as I get the laugh.
I think they ll probably have booze there.
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four by nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
She s not dead
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
Like heroin?
Like love?
Yes.
No.
Get the fuck outta here.
Jesus Christ!
Okay. Great, Martin, that s just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Let me help you along, Martin. You re a sociopath!
You never could have kept this from me.
That s probably a good idea.
I m staying here.
You don t understand...
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I ve lost my passion for work.
I work alone.
You understand the psychology of the job.
No.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It s only natural.
Okay.
Up on the right.
I m setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I m willing to let you in on the ground floor.
Not me. So don t paw at me with your dirty little guild.
No harm no foul.
Hard to get good help these days.
Fine. But we re not going to let you do your job. Because we re gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we re gonna do another little job...
Yeah after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I m gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
I know what I do isn t moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you d see a man worth loving.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
I don t think so.
Nooo
It was the PLO.
We can t do our job unless he does his job.
Do his job? I m not a cold blooded killer.
Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you re the Good Guy.
He using her.
One cannot love and kill.
If he does our job, he s our job.
No...
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
This?
It s from one of those P. O. Boxes. How was the trip?
All of it?
That s going to cost.
I m not happy.
He didn t.
And they want me to make up for it.
Tell them that s impossible. I need my normal lead time.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
There s nothing to be done about it.
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
Never enough.
It s fine.
Yes. It s the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh And if you could find out why they double booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back that s be great.
That s wonderful, Mom.
It s a place where religious people
Jim?
I spoke to your father the other day.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
I think I ll go see Debi today.
I can t think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Yeah...
Paul?
Same thing that happened to you I stopped poutin there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don t you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
Kind of crept up on you, didn t it?
Yeah, but it s still kind of eerie, isn t it?
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I m a professional killer.
He sold me this bad boy.
He gave me a great deal.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
That s too bad.
Well, see, truth is, ma am, I help horses with people s problems.
Ma am, I m very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I m afraid you ve misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don t do that sort of thing.
Look, even if it was nearer, that s just not what I do. I give clinics. And I m not even doing them for a while. I m heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex
Plenty of signs just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you re not just passing through!
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Well, that ll be a little complicated
Well, it s worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
You ever just stand still for a minute?
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you re here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
What s that to miss?
Does Chicago count?
When I was first married.
Well, I, uh... you didn t...
A jogger, huh?
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
You sleeping all right in that house?
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R. B. is my wife... ex wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
It s all right. He s young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
Why don t you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
Need a lift?
You haven t heard the question yet. Truth is, you d be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
He d be grateful, he d take real good care with you.
Yeah, it s been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Well, he don t know that. Just sit the horse. Good... You have a nice seat.
Feel good?
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
Five years. My son was born here.
Yeah. I haven t seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
It is. It s lovely.
That s very important to you, isn t it? Home.
Not really. I d forgotten how long it s been since I ve done this. And I couldn t get any Parmesan cheese.
I am comfortable.
Annie!
I don t care! We d be together.
The point was to love each other.
Doesn t matter. I... I don t want to come back, that s all.
I m not coming back! That s it! I want to go home!
Is that your version of a pep talk?
Fine!
I brought it to you in the hospital.
Grace, I put it on the table near your
What about him?
I think we should. It s not fair to let him suffer. He s not much use anymore. He d hate living like that.
Mom?
Maybe they should put me down too.
Enough time tomorrow. I know.
Whatever you want.
I already did. This morning. When you went running.
I didn t know I had to.
I don t care.
What?
Bullshit! It s about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody like we work for you or something!
You just want to get away from Daddy and you re using me to do it!
You re amazing! You act like I don t live in that house! Don t you think I hear the two of you!? Don t you think I can tell what s going on? I m not five years old, Mom! You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn t want to.
He doesn t have to! It s, like, so obvious you can t stand him.
Then why do you want to leave?
Don t they believe in signs here?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
You already did.
Why? There s no food in the house?
Well, one was for salad...
I ll take care of it.
About what?
Yeah. Does that mean I m cured?!
... You worried everything all right now and we ll have to go home?
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
I can t remember the last time you made him dinner.
Yeah, you know everything!!
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn t about you and Tom.
My period.
What?... Oh baby...
That s not true.
What?
Uh, nothing. I m going to pick it up in the other room would you hang this up for me?
So do you.
Good.
Hi.
I should be in by two.
Sure... What s Grace up to?
That s okay. We have to talk about it and we re not always in the same place... so... I just have to get used to it. What do you want to do about dinner?
No, it s got a little left. They ll be in to change it.
No, let me go.
We re very lucky.
Okay.
Sing it to me, Frankie!
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It s ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
I love you.
Doing what?
All our " favorite " people were there saying all their " favorite " things about their " favorite " subjects. I thought to myself, we ve been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We re so afraid we won t like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
Yeah.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
Robert, Grace isn t adjusting to school. And she can t sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
I ve called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we d stay at motels along the way...
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
I m not asking you to. I ll do it.
He ll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I m the one who taught Grace how to ride.
Why?!
I can t say he s been all that effective with her.
I don t care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can t sit here and trust everything s going to work out just by pretending it will.
She will if you think she should.
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty two employees to interview before Monday. I don t know how I m going to do it.
Yeah, but nothing I can t handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks s plotting, but what else is new.
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn t know.
I know. We miss you too.
Oh, Robert, I m sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn t have the energy to take my clothes off.
Everything all right.
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
About what?
Oh. I didn t look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
You re allergic to hay.
You don t have to explain. You have every right to come.
No, it s okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn t know what the hell was right.
Connecticut. I told the office I d work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
May I have a suggestion?
Take your time.
I don t understa
Hi. Um, there doesn t seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for " Tubab " who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you " Tubab "?
What do you mean?
You want to take a walk with me?
Oh, I don t know...
No. He had the choice.
Uh, no, we re going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don t want to impose.
She calls him Tommy...
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I m not going to.
I was there for that shot, actually.
I d love to go there one time...
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I m sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I ve said it out loud.
No, it s more like a leave of Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher s wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that s not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain t saying it s the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
They don t come better. But I don t deny there are times I wonder about things I won t have. Maybe one day I ll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
Annie, I m not good at this kind of talk goes round and round a thing but never comes to it so let s just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn t like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don t go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don t make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Promise?
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it s under control.
Yes, but he s in a tremendous pain...
I understand, but Annie, please...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
It isn t right to make him suffer...
Problem is, there aren t many volunteers. He s already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
Oh hell, I don t know... According to Tom, she s a pretty determined woman. Must ve thought it was worth it.
What?
Diane!
Diane takes care of the books. I don t know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
Sure. As long as she don t mind.
That s what some folks say.
Have you talked to Tom about it?
I don t thinks you d want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
Probably. She s on the phone twenty three hours a day.
She s an editor.
Drive? I m not old enough yet.
I don t know if I can with my leg.
I don t know if I can.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
I know where he goes.
What does that mean?
No, you re only going to hurt him some more.
No!
You want to go to a movie tonight?
No, not yet.
I know. Amazing.
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
You just showing off for her!
We still have a way to go.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I m late.
Fit? You want to check my teeth. Good crowd today. I think you ll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
Kind of trouble I m in the mood for.
I don t any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
How long were you married?
You ever miss it?
Where did you learn all this stuff?
About horses? I d love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
What do you mean?
Now that s cool.
Yeah, cool.
It s cool!
It looks good, sir. We ve got an uncorrupted hard drive.
I m sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don t think he had time to erase his computer files.
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
... IF it weren t run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Hackers of the World, Unite!
Shh!
Look at this, it s so lean and clean.
That s far out!
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
It was him, man!
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Never send a boy to do a woman s job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Cereal.
Go fix the phones.
Curtis.
Dead?
I m sorry. Who are you?
Blow me.
I told you, I don t play well with others.
That s bullshit.
You lay a finger on her and I ll kill you.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn t know what s on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She s not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Yeah, maybe I m not. But we are, you asshole.
Never heard of you. Done anything?
How did you know that?
What s this one eat?
Fucked if I care, man.
My... class. You mean I m not in your class?
Think you can do better?
I said give me time.
What?
It s cool, I m just looking.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
Crash Override. What was it. " Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest? "
Are you challenging me?
If I win, you become my slave.
You wish. You ll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
Make it my first born.
You re not gonna win.
I m sorry, I can t.
Okay. I ll copy it.
Uh, hold on...
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Right. And when the worm s ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
I know, I know who wrote it.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
I ll make it up to you!
Razor and Blade! They re flakes!
It s somehow connected with the worm that s stealing the money.
Yeah.
What?
You would have looked better.
They didn t. The guys felt it was the only way I d get a date. Anyway, you re pretty good. You re elite.
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I m in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I ve got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don t get it in, he s gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques. Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
It s a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
Yo, chill man, I m talking to Venezuela.
Homicidal?
No. He s either very smart or very stupid.
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool? A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
We caught em.
What s happening?
The System Command Processor, it s the brain.
My name is the Plague.
As in what, you hapless techno weenie?
I ve narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Joey, Joey...
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
Nono, it s like hot or something. I don t know.
Hey, it s me.
I m freaking! Joey wasn t making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I m in jail! They re charging me with some serious shit! And there s stuff I didn t even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
Once again, don t call me Eugene. A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
Virus?
Excuse me?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they d arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can t do on our own.
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
Congratulations.
So?
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
Yeah. To civilians. But they re hackers. But don t worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they ll all be put away.
Nothing, it s just a minor glitch.
Hello, operator? I m having trouble dialing a number.
555 4202.
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith s Grove.
Yeah. Should be on the road.
Real charmer.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
Okay sure. What about?
My parents baby sitter canceled.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
This morning.
Don t get angry.
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
I don t know Brady.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
We ve been better.
Michael Myers.
Not without Jamie.
What does that mean?
Get back!
Brady! Come with us.
Brady!
Get up there Rachel!
You ll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Its too late.
You guys always look great.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope she feels better. Susan s mother, she can t baby sit tonight.
How do you know their not?
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9: 30 yet.
Sure ain t. Martians could land on Ben s doorstep, all he d do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
Got it Earl.
I can t sleep.
Do you love me Rachel?
Like a sister?
Like a real sister?
I know you miss your parents, its hasn t been that long.
Your mother used to baby sit me when I was your age. I bet you didn t know that.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It s my fault that you can t.
I don t want to.
Double scoops?
You ready for some Ice Cream?
It was the nightmare man
Coming.
No way! Halloween s great. Can we stay out all night?
No.
I can t.
I ve got you come on, go down.
Everybody s dead. I just wanna go home.
Then we ll be safe?
Dad, what s going on?
Why?
You knew. You just didn t care.
Don t you mean what you do best?
No. Brady s working there till 6: 00 today.
I don t want to look pushy.
Well I don t want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Well I don t want to seem desperate or anything.
I don t know.
Its not over yet.
The Corruther s house. That s where Jamie lives, that s where he ll go.
The state police won t know how to stop him.
Right here, Ben.
This is 132, over.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
What are we doing?
Isn t this all a little paranoid?
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr....
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He s here in Haddonfield.
He s here, Sheriff.
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out. And assuming what you say is true..
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
He s been here.
It isn t a man.
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr.. ah
Car trouble?
Your hunting it, ain t ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Now you understand?
Hi, Dad. What happened?
What happened?
You blame everything on kids.
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
We just talked.
I wouldn t want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
I don t know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick or treating.
I m never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys locker room to tell me...
I have a place for that.
Look where?
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Why did you hang up on me?
Of course.
I had my mouth full. Couldn t you hear me?
Now you hear obscene chewing. You re losing it, Laurie.
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I ll pick you up. 6: 30.
I wasn t spooked.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle s back yard.
He was watching me.
He can still watch.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack O Lantern would keep him occupied.
Thanks.
What s this big, big news?
I d say you must have the wrong number.
Annie, you didn t. Tell me you didn t.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
I can t.
If you watch her, I ll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
Well, come on, get your coat. We re going to pick up Paul.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
... Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY S clothes off. I think I ve got it.
Just answer the damn phone.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Will you call me tomorrow?
Promise?
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
Looks like to me you re just plain scared.
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I m going to wait for him.
If you do they ll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
You all right?
Nothing s going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you re way off on this...
You re not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Well, it s going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You re telling me they re lined up for a slaughterhouse.
I found the car! He s here!
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
As usual, I don t have anything to do.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
No. I thought she d be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I ve got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Same time, same place.
Sure.
Sure.
Uh uh. That s a spook house.
I don t like that story.
Why are they under there?
After the movie.
After the Jack O Lantern.
There is no such thing.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
There was no one outside.
What did he look like?
We re no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
And I m here tonight and I won t let him get to you.
I promise.
I saw him...
What is it, Laurie?
I m scared...
It s the bogyman, isn t it?
Yes.
I killed him...
Let s make more popcorn.
You re coming with us...
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
Will you get her for me?
Well, go tell her it s me, okay?
Of course not.
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he s going.
What did you use before?
He ll barely be able to sit up.
Are there any special instructions?
I think we should refer to it as him. '
Only minimum security.
What does that mean?
You don t have to make this harder than it already is.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
Shouldn t we pick him up?
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
Come in, come in.
Mmm?
I know. You re an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Are you really interested?
You want to see some?
Well, let s do it.
And then, uh, April... huh?
Oh, is that what it is?
Right.
Yeah.
... a monstrosity! Who would do that?
It depends on what way you want to go.
Uh...
Oh, I m just glad we have a catering job this week. I m real low on money.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera. I didn t know what to say.
No, he called late last night.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Well, I I I didn t know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it. He said, uh, he d taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
I know. I said that, but... he said it was something he really felt like doing.
Right.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home. I think it s a matter for your analyst... and mine.
Only a few. A few. Do you like em?
Really? How flattering! Did you try the shrimp puffs?
We re actresses.
Really? Is the food that bad?
Yeah, we re the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Uh huh.
Yes.
Yeah.
And it ruins everything else.
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Yes.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
... and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
You mentioned on the phone that you d had some dizziness.
When did you first notice this?
Yes, now now that you mention it, uh, I I I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing. Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
Well, if it s nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all? I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I m, so I m a little weak on the, on the high decibels. So I, you know, I won t go to the opera.
Like what?
I told him about your work, and he s very excited.
Look I I I ll be okay. I ll be okay.
Now, look, you you you go on ahead.
Yeah?
Well, are... are they big?
Ed Smythe, yes.
Could you
Read the papers! Half the country s doing it!
Oh, Elliot!
What are you doing here?
Oh, what, in this section of town?
You re out looking here?
Ohhhh!
Oh. Well, I live
Yes, I do.
Oh. You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Oh, God.
Don t let me get started on my childhood. Oh, you know what? There is a bookstore.
Yes?
Well, i if if you have some free time...
Yes, it s it s wonderful.
You seem tense. Is everything all right? You feel okay?
No?
I m... all right.
Oh, no, I can t let you get me that. That s too much.
No, I don t think so.
Uh, uh, this is great. I mean, I love e. e. cummings, but I can t let you get this.
Well, sure.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime. Uh... uh, I d love to see what goes on.
Bye.
Oh, you know... I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, that s really nice of you.
Oh.
Yeah.
What are you doing?!
I, I must apologize. I I m, I I m sorry. I m so mixed up.
Oh, don t say those words!
What do you expect me to say?
Wh She s never said anything, and we re very close. She d tell me such a thing.
Not because of me, I hope.
Oh, I can t be the cause of anything between you and Hannah. I jus
Why?
But not over me?
Poor Hannah.
I can t say anything!
Look, don t do anything on my behalf. I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
I almost didn t.
I didn t sleep all night.
I don t want anyone else ever to have you.
Yes, she s, she s very warm, but, but it it s me that wants to be giving to you. I I I want to do things for you. Hannah doesn t need me as much. I m being presumptuous. Not that you need me.
No.
Uh... I I I know. I deserve this.
If if if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
It s been nearly a year since our first time and you re still married to my sister, which... I now realize is fine because you re probably much more in love with her than you know.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Aren t they great?
No, she doesn t, either. You ve got tons as well.
I know.
Let s go have dinner, shall we?
I ve, uh... gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk. I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
Was I?
Well, I I don t think it s a very good idea.
Because it s the last thing in the world we need right now.
I don t know.
But, you got four children!
Well... I I think we should wait till things settle.
You know, y you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured. A a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h, a home in Connecticut. I it s all very... preconceived.
Are you angry with me?
Do you feel, um... are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Are you in love with someone else?
What kind of interrogation... Su supposing I said yes? I I I am disenchanted. I am in love with someone else.
No! But you keep asking these, these awful questions. My God, it s it s like you want me to say yes!
Get his wine away.
Yeah.
But Catholicism? Why not your own people?
I know it sounds funny, but I m gonna try.
Oh! Cause you won t exist!
I don t understand. Aren t you frightened?
Yeah, I know. But never to exist again!
Absolutely.
I m going through a period of my life where I just can t be around people. I didn t want to wind up abusing anyone.
Mmm...
Mm hm.
Because he likes you.
I can t take this anymore.
I m not your pupil. I was, but I m not.
Oh, you know what. I m suffocating!
Yes, we re going to have this conversation again. I... I have to leave. I have to move out.
Because I have to!
I don t know. I thought, maybe I d move in with my parents for a while.
Well, maybe it ll only be temporary, but I ha I have to try.
No.
No.
I m sorry.
I m saying it now!
Who is it?
But who? Where did you meet him?
Jesus... Jesus!
Oh...
Hello?
But not you.
I can t keep my mind on the show.
If there s nothing wrong with me then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
Like what?! What?
Don t say that! I don t want to hear that word! Don t mention that while I m in the building.
Naturally, I, I Do you know I The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
Mickey, you re off the hook. You should be celebrating.
Yeah... but you re not dying!
Can I tell you something? Can I tell you a secret?
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
I went into a store, I bought a rifle. I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself. The only thing that mighta stopped me, might ve, is my parents would be devastated. I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first. And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
I know, I know, and your hamster.
I think they re fantastic.
You look so beautiful.
Doesn t she look pretty?
Hi. She s auditioning for a television commercial. She said she s gonna be a little late.
Why?
Oh, me, I m okay.
No.
How are you?
You know, how s everything? You doing okay? How s Frederick? I mean, Elliot.
Really?
Oh...
Oh, now
I m I m okay. Yeah, I I I, you know, I... I m just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden. I m I m... I have a headache.
I know, she... she really writes good dialogue.
I know... I know.
I got two minutes.
Huh?
Everything s good. Everything s fine.
He s fine.
Oh, you know what? I m trying to convince him to produce a play.
I think he ll find that satisfying.
I think so.
Yeah.
H he s so awkward and he s clumsy like me...
... so I, so I like that. I always like an underconfident person...
... you know? I, uh...
Thanks, thanks.
That s a beauty!
Oh!
Wow!
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
I don t know. Excessive masturbation?
Well, what about artificial insemination?
You know, where I I I would get implanted from a a donor.
Fro? You want a a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
With a, with a stranger? With a
No! I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention. He s gotten sourer as he s gotten older, and I ve tried to stay young... at heart.
The sacrifices I ve made because of that man. He s ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his his his his his mediocrity!
He s the one that s made every ingenue in stock!
Th th they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Yes, she s lovely, but she doesn t have your spark. She knows it. She worships you. She wouldn t dare get up there on the stage.
True.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Someday, I ll pay it all back.
Yeah.
Will you just tell me one thing?
Are we talking about cocaine again?
When does Frederick ever come with her?
It s, uh, you never know
He s not a loser at all!
He s the headmaster of Daisy s school.
Here. Be careful with those.
Well, how about this?
Oooo.
Oh?
Singing?
Really?
You know.
I mean, y you know, don t say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I
Uh huh.
No, I didn t, I, that s no. No, I I I, no, I I just... hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know. You know, you know how you take...
Yeah. Well, maybe I ll get it.
What? You don t, don t be so sensitive. Can t I say anything?
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Yeah, that s clerical.
I m not! I m not! I m trying to be helpful. A person doesn t just say one day, " Okay, now now I m finished as an actress. Now I m a writer. " I mean
How?
Hmm!
Uh, losers! All losers!
Look. Listen. Listen. You want to write? Write.
Write! Let s just not talk about it anymore.
It s obviously based on Elliot and me.
No, not " Oh, so loosely "! Real specifically! Is that how you see us?
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something. You think I m too self sufficient?
You re grateful, but you resent me.
I don t... I don t want to bother everyone.
I don t see how you could know about these things unless Elliot s been talking to you.
I can t hear you. I can t hear anything. I m, I m, I m, I m gonna lose hearing in my ear! I m
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown! I can t hear anything.
No!
Not when they re sung by extraterrestrials.
Do you mind? I m I m my own person.
Eh, Mickey, it s getting late.
Well, if you didn t like it, you didn t like it, but you didn t have to talk while the guy was singing.
Yeah, that s tough! You don t deserve Cole Porter. You should stay with those groups that look like they re gonna stab their mother!
And you don t have to snort cocaine at the table all the time! What do you, what do you do? Carry a kilo around in your purse?
Yeah. Me, too.
Right. Yeah. I had a...
I remember you.
I recall you.
Yeah.
We didn t hit it off.
How are you?
I m fine.
Oh, no.
Yeah?
Yeah, it was.
... in a really horrible way.
You look wonderful. You do. What happened to you?
Well, I hope you ve changed.
Yeah, and for yours. I m sure you ve changed.
I m okay.
Oh, nothing much. You know...
... just some stuff. A little of this, a little of that, that s all.
Probably not.
No, well... I ve been trying to write.
Yeah.
Oh... well, you you re not interested in this.
Come on.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, " Hey, I have something I just wrote, " right?
Really?
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you. I don t know why it would.
You ve always hated my taste in the past.
You have.
I m not anymore. I haven t, I haven t been in television for a year.
Oh. Oh.
I m Yes. Yes, I m fine. I m fine. How are you?
What... what about your script? So what s it about?
Hmm.
Yeah.
Oh, gosh, I don t know. Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Hmm. I think it s lucky I ran into you. Maybe.
Oh, well.
It s great. I swea I m I m, tch, I m speechless. I was... I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now. I don t know what to say. I m moved and I laughed and I Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat. I just think it s wonderful! I m, I m totally... stunned. This is not an insult. I m amazed that you can... It was I just thought it was great.
Yes! I was abso And... w what... made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and and the ex wife who s schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Well, it was just fabulous! I m, I, you know...
I thought it was wonder There s maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
... but who cares? It was just It was fabulous.
I am. You you made my day.
It was just great. Uh, I was all set... I was set to be bored stiff.
I I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script. I I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Oh, who cares?
Oh, yeah? What?
Oh, don t be silly! No! Don t be ridiculous.
Sure. Sure, uh, yes.
Hi.
Okay.
Just a few minutes ago.
You know, I was talking with your father before... and I was telling him that it s ironic. I I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah... and I never thought that I could love anybody else. And here it is, years later and I m married to you and completely in love with you. The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle. It really is. I... It d made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister... doesn t work out... many years later... he winds up married to the other sister. It s, you know, it s a...
Mmm, what?
At least she isn t drinking. Did you notice?
Get a garter belt... Get a garter belt and flirt.
Oh...
... you don t have to think.
I m on the track of a reward, which...
I m going to tell you later....
Some museum director disappeared.
They re offering...
What is this, a whorehouse, or are you my wife?
... I was working...
I swear to you...
Yes? My promotion...?
I have not read you your rights.
I hereby acknowledge that...
Then why did you chose to inform me of it...?
Oh yeah? Wanna arm wrestle...?
... what hindered you...?
Perhaps you did not have the support you required.
Or, perhaps...
It s a growth business.
Orderly.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
I m struck by your phraseology. I did not last with him. I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
He said, and these were his words, he valued our time together, because I was civil.
We got a bunch of materials, coming up at auction. Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter s cell, drawings he made, his books.
And I d like your help, determining who s bidding for their purchase.
Waal, because your selling em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller s affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz. P. A. N. Z. Sounds to me like an Orderly. Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
Here s what they want you to do: we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
Let s just say they got a passion for collectibles...
Now, whyn t you help us?
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
Say it in English.
Then who s buying it?
That s the spirit...
You want me to be?
Let s keep it to business, shall we?
... they did it for a lark.
Rich, comic book freaks.
Because we both know who s buying the Lechteriana.
Mason Verger. For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice. Can you be free....?
Oh, yes. He s found Peace.
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I m ready....
I m not.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
And who is " they? "
... the whole world s out to get you...
Well, you wanna shoot back, it give you a big target...
M I gonna see you tonight?
Then I m doing fine.
I know her by the Back.
Are you alright...?
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
What s up...?
Yeah, so where is he?
They got that kind of money?
Atrocious Torture. Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
Impossible.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
You take this much time over everything?
Not with any certainty we...
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
... are you alright, sir...?
Seen what, sir..?
Somewhere in Italy.
... then we won t need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
No. And...
... yes, if you ll, just step away...
Yes. You know I will. That s right.
The children...?
I ve never heard that he...
I won t take much of his time.
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a donation. To a charitable institution of your choice.
I... think... he was.... he was touched, by your reaction. To his appearance.
Exactly.
Do you know the seller?
Try Barney Clark.
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter s stay in Prison.
Before " The Change, " Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study.
.... I hardly think so... after " The Incident "...
... Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
... young boys, still...?
Mmm...
You said the bad news...
I believe that your tone implied that there was some good news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for you...
I can make you rich.
Come on, stay with us. Look here: I could get behind you, and give you a spinal, tomorrow, you wuunt feel anything down there, a l il pulling is all. N I ll tell you what, after he s got his jollies, ten, f teen minutes, I ll come down here, give you a shotta this stop your heart, an that s you done, an there s an end to it. What do you say...? I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so. I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it around...... stay with me now, fuss with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a code... move that money to me, he confirms it, and I fix you up Right Now... Whatsay?
Come on, Doctor, then you can sleep...
Let the girl go.
For a consideration.
Shut up, Starling...
Starling, I ve ordered you to shut...
Starling...?
... what s he got against you?
You seen John Brigham...?
... what m I looking at...?
... standard issue...
Am I on that case, sir...?
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
I m going to work for your reinstatement...
Well, well, well, well, well, she went in there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, without the Felon, with out the gun...
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
I think its meaning is clear.
That could be.
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall. And...
I don t think so...
You nervous...?
Said what?
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
I said sometime it gets so...
You want to hold him...?
Well, you know my name, honey, but I don t know yours...
Could you tell me: did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a note, a farewell note, a suicide note...
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
Of course, in his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
Why did you look at me that way?
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
... your scar..?
How so?
You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family s chapel at Santa Croce.
I wonder no longer. You were out of the country.
I sense... The faintest whiff of a perfume, whose base, whose base, whose base is " Hamamelis "... it is witch hazel such a clean scent. No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World. I would say, you have been in America. Have I struck home?
Well, if you will excuse me. Madame. What a pleasure.
If such there breathe, I m sure you could unearth him... Your reputation does you honor.
Yes, I think I amused them. To what do I owe...?
Where do you live?
She my foster.
No.
We got KittyKat...
... and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
... who say...?
They will, sir. We train them, to the figurine, eventually, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
Is it necessary to know?
Sir, I m in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
THEN WHERE WAS IT? I m sent out there... I m told that the arrest must be a joint...
And I m telling you: You wanna throw a Birthday Party: Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that s fine, but...
Due respect, you don t, sir, your precious Joint Operation. FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it s alphabet soup, we don t have the same Radio Freqs, we don t...
... get outta my way, you sonofa bitch...
Perhaps... shall we see...?
Thank you. No, I know you d prefer " I m glad you find me so... "
What is that that smells so wonderful.
... we were speaking of my father...
... and my need for The Institution...
And how did he do that?
I m afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
... but will that satisfy you?
It is not that I care for you but that I posses an enquiring mind. What will you do when I am gone? When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
Yes.
Would that add to your mirth?
You re free...
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime. The Greatest crime. Perhaps the only crime. I never ceased to hope!
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence. DON T YOU THINK? IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON T YOU THINK? BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE HIM AND HER FOR THE PIGS!
Alcohol. Where both its life enhancing And its life destroying qualities...... not unlike some Hindu God...
What else s he goin to do with his day, he can t work, and he won t steal...
That s what I should do. Tell me why?
Show m the FBI Hand shake...
You re going to do that?
The Multi Jurisdiction Task Force: read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo. The man s hazing you.
I ll tell you what: I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota.
Saying what, " Look out for a guy with ten fingers...? "
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your mind cleared.... you don t wanna go out there a half step slow...
What do you want to do? You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
What broke you free, Girl?
... something about my father...?
Every suicide kills two.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Y want to gimme Brigham s pistol?
You goin to shoot yourself?
Why?
No, y know, I never doubted it...
Hey, lost again.
I m sure there is, but my young Friend here, would kill you.
The great and beautiful...
No, I get it, this is my Cavalier. This gents my Italian Knight. Take this... For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
Or clear your windshield with it.
I know it well.
... but: this particular statue...
.... this is perhaps an inappropriate time... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who solved the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
They re grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
Brazilian.
And what does that mean?
I can t remember. I ve got to make some money.
No, sir, it s not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
Because?
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
Why are you... don t stop... why?
Yeah... Are we going to do it or what? I still haven t packed.
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
And this Peepers was your... dog? If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn t paying attention.
Don t raise your voice at I gave you the ultimate male fantasy sex, nothing on the side. Don t pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
Andrew. You re not gay; you re ten. You shouldn t even be having thoughts like...
Well, uh... Promise me you won t do anything until you re 18.
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
Call me conservative, but I d rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry s lovely visage.
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
Uh, yeah, that s... wow.
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
Eric... You can t be like me. You have to be better. I m not the guy you think I am...
Wha at? What is it?
I hope so...
What are you gonna do about it?
Sorry about all that... I m your CIT Jasper.
Your Secret admirer?
Hey, I thought I wasn t your type.
Hey, it s not a crush anymore if  you actually say it to the person  you supposedly have the...   JASPER  Thought I d get points for a post  modern approach to coming on to you. 
Stop, stop... I m willing to put my mouth where my mouth is... I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it dramatic pause You let me go down on you...
You and Wichita go to school together, right? Have you two ever...
" or you re going to get it? " Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won t try moving so fast with Wichita.
Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don t listen to her.
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority? Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita s lightning rod?
I didn t realize I had to declare a major.
I m not a nai ive little...
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
Yeah. And?
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn t mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord s body...
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
Talia, you re a wonderful person...
I just never thought of you in that...
I unno... Don t worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
Yes you do.
I think your passion is terrific.
Gosh, this is really a great conversation I can t believe I said that out loud.
Iunno.
And you ll be happy to know I m going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act... Not all of it, but...
I love you. Don t say I love you, too. I hate that " love you, too. "
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Not now, Wendy.
What do you want me to say?
Stop! Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought... I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the " test "... Do you believe me?
It s not my style, okay?
No, not at all. BRAD You re pretty enough to be one.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn t drinking and driving?
Hey really, I don t feel so great.
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
In my heart, Heather s still alive.
Because you re an idiot.
So what was the first day after Heather s suicide like?
Because you re an idiot.
Something like that. Will you do it?
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn t have to be Vietnam. You don t get treated badly here do you?
If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they re blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
No, but if you re nice I ll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7 11speak pretty well.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
I don t know. Should you?
Time out.... Jason Dean. Your Pop s Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
I don t really like your friends either.
S okay....
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
A well timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
Just saying it s not hard to end a life.
I know exactly what the hell you re talking about and you re right, you don t know what the hell you re talking about. Let s just grow up, be adults, and die.
Chick en.
No shit, sherlock. I can t believe it. I just killed my best friend.
Stop kidding around. I m going to have to send my S. A. T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
Like a suicide thing?
" To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me. "
This is the last thing she ll ever write. She ll want to cash in on as many fifty cent words as poss.
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
" I die knowing no one knew the real me. "
My Mom s making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Get crucial. We won t be using blanks this time.
Exquisite, but I don t think ununderstanding is a word.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Oh.
You must have had fun.
Oh come on. Lots of people drink Perrier. It s come a long way.
Yeah, but don t worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
I did not want them dead.
Did not.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way s better. We scare people into not being assholes.
Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke s wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
What in the hell do you think I m doing? Taking out her tonsils?
You re not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there s a school that self destructed not because society didn t care, but because that school was society. Is that deep or what? I ll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
Just push the red button twice. That s what stops it. If that s what you want, babe?
I thought I... you..
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
What did your boyfriend say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
Let s kick his ass.
I think so, man.
Shut the fuck up, all right.
I guess.
I m lost. You don t get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
But Ms. Fleming, it s just not right.
Where is he? Where s J. D.?
What s that?
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
Actually, Mr. Rieper... it s a novel, and we ll be sending it to New York. That s where all the big publishing houses are based.
Playfully shoves his hand away.
Come on through.
Look who I ve found!
Pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline s plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
I ve just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
Pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
Comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
I m not hungry.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven t!
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
But she ll have no one to look after her!
Sighs.
Well, I guess I take after you then!
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
It s a letter from the school... from Miss Stewart.
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn t think you ll get School Certificate.
I care... your father cares... we want you to have a good education.
You re failing English... you used to be top of the class PAULINE I m doing my own writing!
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don t seriously think anyone s going to publish them?
Is very angry.
I don t wanna be in bloody school!
Don t be so ridiculous. You re our daughter, you belong here with us.
You re not going anywhere. You re 15 years old!!
And HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
Hurries over.
Gives her a sympathetic look.
They sent me off to the Bahamas " for the good of my health. " They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands " for the good of my health. "
I m sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I m feeling quite fatigued.
Stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
It doesn t matter.
It s so beautiful!
You re such an incredible woman.
What??
No, you re not, Gina it s everybody else who is bonkers!
Hurry up! I m freezing!
I can try my father s safe. I m sure I can get the keys to his office.
Do you think Bloody Bill s trying to get into her draws?
Yes...
Your mother is a rather miserable woman... isn t she?
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it s going through a meat grinder. I m not sure if I m dreaming or...
Your insight is enlightening.
Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
Well that s not necessarily a bad thing is it?
Shh. Don t blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you ve got me on.
The way you just looked at me...
I m stumped.
Okay Mr. Statistics I ve got one for you. What s the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Second most common?
Eighty third most common.
I understand, I think. Other women?
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Well?
Did I ever talk about the accident?
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
No you don t understand. That s why I ve been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn t be a patient anymore.
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn t remember doing these things and now you are so it s a shock to the system. I m telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife s death.
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Hospital? You haven t been to the hospital since uh...
What?
Yeah, how s that?
Really? Do tell.
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
What s the occasion?
How much time off?
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I ve always wanted to go to take a trip. We re just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn t believe you went through five dart games and didn t even joke about it.
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody d suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
I said she s been missing for
Zero s a number right?
Please, Gwen. You re you re all over me.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you
Gwen, my wife s dead.
What?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Uh... eighty two?
But... I thought...
You ve been cheating on me haven t you?
What?
In a word? Lucrative.
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
What?
Really, why s that?
Where s my wife?
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
I ll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you ve disrupted me at work.
What?
Thanks.
A little? Try unbelievably.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that s common knowledge. But this wasn t murder it was an accident
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I m the executive of the will, Kirsty s entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You re obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
I don t work here.
... but I m starting to think I was... I was going to...
Ambulance.
Two.
This game is over do you hear me?
I don t know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what s under that sheet...
What things do you think you ve done?
All you ve got is the here and the now Trevor. That s all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he s a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he s a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you re describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
I don t even know what s real and what isn t how can I trust anyone?
Whew. You bounce right back don t you?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
I m, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
I ve never said this to a woman before but can t we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
I... think we need to talk, there s something really strange going on...
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it s about... what we did together last night.
Nah, I fucked it up. I was tryin to impress this kid, don t ask me why. I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn t find the poor bastard. He musta blew up. I got the hell outta there. I didn t have the nerve to face the kid.
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
One leg! Like the Red Cross or something?
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
LaPlante!
Talk from there. You can talk from there.
What am I, a goddamn postman? I m way the fuck up here, I m scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter? Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
I don t recall saying I didn t want a million bucks...
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
Jail! Listen, Bubber... This is crazy. We could fall off of here.
What s the big deal? You decided to pretend you were me. A little moment of weakness, right? So I sorta swiped her purse. I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
Huh? Whadda you mean?
I don t need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can t face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
It was you! I thought I heard...
You woulda gone in there, you wouldn ta thought twice... Trust me on that, that s the kinda guy you are. For a guy like me, it s a momentary loss of sanity. I wasn t thinking clearly. Listen, I m no hero, John. I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do gooder bullshit? You didn t spend it all didja?
Bernie. Call me Bernie.
And give a deposition to the jUdge.
On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there s no way I can promise anything. I can t tell him what we re up to...
I... I ll do the best I can, Bernie.
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse. Why not? I had this shoe.
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
I got your bail continued.
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer s report...
We can hope. You still have your job, right?
And a son by your ex wife? Joseph.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
I understand. How often do you see your son?
How recently?
It s November.
" Angel! " I didn t say " angel, " that s a little strong. Listen, here s the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
So you can call me " naive, " Mister LaPlante.
I read the probation report. It s not good. I think you re going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
Mister LaPlante...
Mister LaPlante...
Mister LaPlante...
Spanish kinda guys!
My attorney, she s just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
Nine. I think. Maybe ten. Yeah, ten. Nice kid.
The thing about kids is, they re so... young! They don t know nothin yet. When you re a kid, you think you re gonna grow up an be a " wonderful person " instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
You don t wanna know, Chick, you don t wanna know. Those guys been in here?
You mean like Bubber? The hero?
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern? Is this a riddle or what?
It s a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn t do it. No offense. Me neither. I mean, a guy like Bubber, he s a certain kinda guy. Heroic. You and me, we re not... heroic. It s not our nature. It don t mean we re bad or nothing. We re just not so inclined. What about it?
I wouldn t be depressed about it, Bern. A guy don t have to be heroic to be a human being.
DON T SAY " BILL, " BERNIE! DON T SAY ONE WORD! DIDN T I SAY " ONE WORD AND YOU RE FIRED? "
YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE IT LL BE AN EXCUSE! IT LL BE " BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX. " NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE. THAT S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
THAT S IT! YOU TALKED! YOU RE FIRED! OUTTA HERE! GET OUTTA HERE!
OUT! I TOLDJA. JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING! AN YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT? AN MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING FUCKING FEET?
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn! Absolutely fantastic! I m on my way
Ev, it s not my fault! I m trying to tell you this incredible
Is he here, your friend. The fireman?
He s in bed! You re not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand? He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot s a " war hero " like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
I had to explain your tendancy to " exaggerate ", How you were actually " in country " all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it! And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he d like to hear from you. Where s your other shoe? Never mind! I don t want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
Camera, Chucky. Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir? What is your relationship with John Bubber?
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
Me!
The cops! What kinda bullshit is this? Is this America or?
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I m going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Yes, everybody is in love with John Bubber. The whole country, in fact. And they re not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money grubbing low life fence...
He had one tiny, uncharacteristic moment of weakness. That s not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet... blackmailing a national hero...
You think I haven t figured it out? Just because the cops aren t on to you yet doesn t mean you re home free. I m a veteran reporter. I ve seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
I m going to apologize to Bubber?
Lie, you mean...
I got a kid, you know. I m a person, for Chrissake.
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Who am I? You re asking me? You re the big expert for Chrissake! I m what? The " Scumbag, " right? The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
Me? Listen, I don t give no interviews. That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O Day.
Sometimes. His name s Elliot. He saved a guy s life one time. In a fire.
" The Nomm "? What s that?
Were you in it? In the war?
What picture?
Uh, no.
You were saying you don t want a million dollars.
All the adulation? It makes you feel like a fake, doesn t it?
Yes.
You... you think I saved your... life. I can t take advantage....
No, I don t have the right. You re a news story!
Vietnam!
A script! I thought we just walked through everything...
Gale! I can t go through with this! It s... it s all wrong! '
That s not what I mean...
Gale...
John, I know all about it.
Maybe, maybe not. I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
The... Silver... Mike... Award!
" For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth. "
Unprofessional.
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
She s flying to New York. She s been nominated for a Silver Mike...
It s a wonderful piece. Emotional. I love it.
Relax, Wally. He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Said he s not an actor.
She s talking to him now.
Quit? She wants to quit?
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber has got something to hide? What if he s the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
What?
Who lost a shoe? Wash your hands.
You were in bed. Weren t you?
What s " cynical "?
Never reach out!
You didn t?
We re from Channel Four, yes. We d like to find
He s pretty... remarkable.
Don t be ridiculous. I m a reporter.
What about?
Who?
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn t have to pass as many tests. You want consistency? You want dependability? You want safety?
How are they with kids?
So this really does the trick, eh?
Okay.
Let s watch some TV.
A lot of my stuff hasn t been unpacked yet. Here s the TV.
I m looking for some perfume.
Well, it s for a woman.
It s great. It s clean and airy and quiet there are trees and flowers. There s still some fixing up I have to do, but it s coming along.
Oh, it s nothing. No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
Right.
Well, I ve been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y know, do it yourself type stuff. I still find it very soothing.
Yeah, since I was a kid. I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time. Then I learned a lot more when I was in the
Institution.
Actually, I have met someone. There s a woman I think I like.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you hope the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
Oh, fine. She s gone away for a little while and when she comes back I ve sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
I am. I m really feeling pretty good. I have a much stronger sense of how far I ve come.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
I understand that.
No, no, no, no.
That would be stupid.
A sense of proportion.
Who doesn t?
Well, now, don t go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
It s not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You re going to have to assert yourself a little bit more. Show your affection.
Ask her how she feels.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
I know. I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I ve laid up till now.
There s so much I want to say to her, it s all jumbled up in my mind, and I don t want her to misunderstand
Sure.
Yeah, that was easy.
Isn t that always the way?
General handyman, yeah. I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house. I do housesitting while the owners are away. In fact, that s why I ve been in the area. I ve been living very close by. Here s the part that s giving you trouble, but I won t be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
An occupational hazard, I m afraid.
Uh, no I ve never really found the time to settle down.
Yeah, I ve always been able to make my way in the world. I don t like having to rely on other people.
I was alone a lot as a child. No one to compete with. My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things. When you re all alone it s your own world, you don t have to take orders from anybody. You don t necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
Yeah, I m okay it s been a long night.
Uh huh.
Listen, I m sorry, but it s really late you don t have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
About us.
I m thirsty.
A man scared me.
Why are you mad at each other?
Uh huh.
Did Daddy tease you?
Yeah. There s still a lot I want to do. It s not quite... the kids aren t really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high strung and whines a lot since we ve been here. Look, he hasn t even come in for his food today.
No, I told you. A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
I ve asked him what s wrong.
The same thing his business pressures, the whole move and everything. He s frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
I ve tried to get him to agree to one. I just I don t know... I m getting such weird vibes lately.
Because you d have to get up at five a. m., would you like that?
Here, take this out to the table.
No, honey, I haven t seen him. Didn t you feed him this morning?
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
The pocket s a cinch I ll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
Mom, there s somebody in the house!
No, thanks, Mom I ll go up to bed now.
Neil, don t leave the back doors open I don t want Holly near the pool.
What?
What s that?
Stop knowing me so well.
High end? Honey, it s a whole new budget.
You wanted furniture too, didn t you?
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range? I ll have a stroke. I ve got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
It s a nice pool, isn t it?
Paul Newman in " The Hustler. "
What?
What?
Honey, are you okay?
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine. Don t get in an uproar.
Huh?
Oh great.
No.
All new houses have noises.
One day before we know it it ll be an old house and we ll be old in it and I ll still be paying for it.
Honey, you know what I ve been like lately... I ve been a total zombie. I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
I don t care, Philip. You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead. Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At " Trattoria Valentino "?
Where should I hide the car keys?
Philip! The senior partner?
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
He wasn t there.
Oh, honey.
I m fired. I m unemployed. Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength? Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
This is for the best, you know it is. Why do my socks keep disappearing!
I m having the floor fixed,
Philip, what are you doing here?
There s always an excuse, isn t there?
No, Philip, I don t want you coming back here. And if you want to talk to me call.
What about cable?
Why? I just read your report card. What s the point? Stay home, watch some television, we ll get " Mad " magazine delivered. What kind of report card do you call this?!
I have a cold.
And I can t help having a cold.
No.
Oh yeah? Where s the bed?
It s a double.
Even cosier.
Would you?
What? Who are you? What do you want?
They appear to be authentic.
Interrogation s over, Bedsoe.
Cut him loose. The D. A. says you ain t got shit on this guy.
Lieutenant.
A few days ago.
I already told you. I took a walk.
Central Park.
No. I don t scare easy.
Around.
You didn t bring me here to talk about her.
No.
Lieutenant, you re really frightening me.
No it isn t. A cop died today and the other is barely holding on. I want some answers, Nash.
That doesn t mean you don t know what s going on. You re connected to this guy somehow. He s after you just like the others were.
Since we hardly know each other, I m sure you ll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
No. He was my brother. He died at anothers hand.
Who are you?
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
There will be more to the prize than that. Power will come with it and it must be used for good.
What?
It is a beautiful day. I am merely enjoying it.
Are you always this pleasant? You know what you re problem is?
I hear you.
That s all?
That is what bothers me.
Leaving what?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
I m sure they will.
We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
If it came down to it what would you do?
The sea and I don t agree with each other. Where we off to?
How long is the voyage?
Living. Remember?
She s the King s cousin.
What worries you?
I ve learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
No. What am I to do?
No I will.
That doesn t matter.
Can you really tell from doing that?
She s a treasure she is.
It is. Do not ask me how. I do not know. I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
I would like to say goodbye.
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
The past?
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland your life there.
Why not?
I cannot explain.
Aye.
Where I m going you cannot follow.
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
No we re from Strange facts and mysteries. It s a syndicated show out of..
I remember you.
Are you a cop?
What do you want?
Yes. We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
A lucky guess.
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
You got me.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
This is. Go home. Stay out of this.
I ll be fine.
Because it s my name.
Who was that man last night?
New York is dangerous place.
About what?
I m interested in mythology.
Meet me Tratino s at nine.
You re twenty minutes late.
Why? Because I don t give up all my secrets?
A little yes. My interest in coming here is profession.
Yes it is.
The Calan. Do you know who they are?
No.
Because I don t feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty eight hours.
So?
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
For three hundred years.
I ve seen it.
The crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word: Courage.
And the other one he is like you?
It will end tonight.
Now I can start to live. To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
I do not know and even if I did...
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
That s what the Kurgan said.
Why did you wait?
It will not end tonight.
I know.
No.
I love you, Conner.
I ll no forget you.
I shouldn t have come back here. It was a mistake.
Yes when their troubles can harm them.
Fine.
Why?
My dreams died long ago.
I haven t lived life I ve hidden from it. I ve existed in the shadows.
I think he s dead!
That would be the girl who opened the door. Are the others inside?
Don t tell anyone what you re doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs. You understand me, Larry?
Fuck guessing. You keep your mouth shut.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
He knows better than that.
You think we should take that chance?
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too. You should let them know.
I m going to my desk.
You won t die if you let me help.
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
We got jobs, man; we re working. Why even take the chance?
Shut up, goddamnit! Just calm down!
We re on foot. We can t get away.
Stop it! They found the truck, Kev! They re already behind us!
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Bullshit. Why would Mars do that?
That s crazy, Dennis. The cops will see us.
We re fucked until we think of a way out; then we re rich.
For chrissake, please! Help me celebrate! I figured it out!
What are you talking about?
That s crazy. He s not going to kill us.
Fuck it s over. That money s mine.
Let me speak to Mr. Smith. I want to hear it from him.
How about your two friends? You don t have a man dying in there, do you?
You don t have to explain shit! That Chinaman pulled a gun. We wrestled for it. That Chinaman shot himself.
How about the cop?
Fuck that. They re the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
I m here.
That s not going to happen, Dennis. They won t give you a helicopter.
What?
The one and only. We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
Okay.
Fuck that! You bastards will jump me!
You ll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Hey, I ve got a situation here, in case you haven t noticed.
Use more ice.
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
Who gives a shit, Mars? Check out the cash! We re rich.
Find something: Extension cords, rope, wire we ll have to tie them tight.
I got the gasoline
I like it here, Dennis. I m never going to leave.
I overheard him with the girl.
I don t know.
That would be Mars Krupchek. Jesus, he works for me, too.
Keeps to himself, more like.
It won t be a problem.
Okey doke.
Give me an ETA.
What do you mean?
Goddamnit, tell me what you know. Did the cops go in? Did Smith have the disks?
What hospital?
Mr. Jones is dead. So are two of his men. The other three are in jail. I have the disks. I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker? I have you.
My wife and my daughter and the money. I ll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family. We ll trade.
Yeah.
Where is it?
You re hiding, Jeffrey. You re hiding from the job and you re hiding from me.
Don t worry about it. How are you doing?
You sure?
That big asshole nailed my windows.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs. Then we can run for it.
You go, Thomas. You get out, and I ll stay with Daddy.
Shh, they ll hear you!
I don t drink beer.
I don t see why you can t just lock me in. It s not like I can go anywhere.
Whatever.
He s just knocked out. I ve been knocked out.
Do you want to go or not? I m offering you a way out of here.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast. Mars and Dennis don t know I m doing this.
Dennis and Mars are in the den. I ll get your brother, then come back for you. We ll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
He said something about a girl
What are we going to do about Mike?
Just one question. Please.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
Three white males shot Junior. Mike followed them to York Estates
What s that, Chief? Say again.
We have a boy on the line. He says he s Thomas Smith and he s calling from the house.
I ve done it once or twice. I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you ll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Jesus. He must ve siphoned it from the cars.
Looks like you re bailing out at the right time.
If we have a man dying in there, we ll have to go in.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
I m looking for you. I need your tactical unit.
Don t question me, Captain! This is my crime scene!
Are all of you named Jones?
You used to be a cop. All of you used to be cops. I can tell by the way you move.
How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
What?
Special Agent Jones.
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we ll wait for the man to call. When he gives the word, we move.
Not until the man calls.
Where s the office?
Dennis hit him. His head s all big and he won t wake up. I m really scared.
We re okay.
The doctors are taking care of him right now. Thomas... are you safe? Can you talk?
I need your help with something. But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don t want you to do it, okay?
I m serious, Thomas; I don t want you to get hurt.
Your dad has two computer disks. They have funny names: Marlon and Al.
I think he was working on them today, so they re probably in his office. Could you find them and see who they belong to?
I thought they locked you in your room.
Can you get into the office?
I opened Marlon. I think it s somebody s taxes.
Who is it?
Yes.
A man has my family. Gold watch here. Dark tan.
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
We, who is we?
That s what I came to talk to you about.
The Hutu Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U. N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
Do you know how to open the safe there? Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
Name a price.
How many in your family?
And four children?
I don t have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
Business is good at the hotel?
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
You have no whiskey?
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
We  re not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That s the ground rules.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I m ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya?
Good. I d like to book a massage.
When will they be here?
I don t have to listen to you anymore.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
For supplies, you drive.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
Promoted. House Manager.
I m sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
I would never do that.
Move? Where to?
The third floor are low class rooms.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
He wants your wisdom.
What?
I couldn t help.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
I sent them home. Go and call them.
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Please. Let them stay til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
No, Odette says he s in shock.
He needs to be in a safe place. Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
What about us?
But who is left?
What are you saying, Tatsi?
What for Paul.
So where is the lamb?
Go out! Where?
No, no.
You cannot go alone.
In Ruhengeri?
Yes.
What?
Why?
What was the bribe? What am I worth to you?
Tell me what it was.
What sort of car?
I want to know.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
No! Sit down now.
What sort of plan?
Please do not talk like this.
What s wrong?
What s wrong?
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
He has taken the presidential suite.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
Thank you, sir.
When?
The staff, the guests.
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Where?
Can I help you?
What is his room number?
Not too big on it myself but then again, not on marriage either.
I m confused.
You re the Doctor, sweetheart. Guess the atropine worked, then.
And what s Steven s status?
" oh, no, Officer, I m very much alive just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game What? What do you mean he s dead? It s all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself! "
The James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger
So what stopped her?
There s already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
So we don t even know if she s alive or dead
There s plenty: for all we know, Steven s got her spying on us right now
But nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven t been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof positive that their lives are in danger.
But they didn t see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven s bloody hands right next to it!
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
Oh dear.
I got an engraved literally invitation with my name
Three times, to be exact.
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we ve been informed.
What was he doing here?
I ll stay, if it ll ease your mind.
A cleaning crew s supposed to arrive at 9: 30 tomorrow morning I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
Price didn t make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
What?
And we get this money when?
Prove it.
I m better than that.
Why?
Most fun I ve had all day.
Start with the name you were born with, and we ll work forward from there.
I don t think so...
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes let alone rewire an entire house. You don t fit the bill not even close.
An answer, I hope: exactly what or who Melissa was taping.
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
No prob: I ll just hop down the hardware store
Not a chance there s too much weirdness down there I don t think even bullets are gonna stop.
That s the fact, bud
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
That s crazy!
It s succeeding!
Run.
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
You ve got your own TV show?
I m impressed: I don t think Evelyn s ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
You shouldn t be you were nearly just killed, sweetheart. And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they d be willing to do anything. I thought you d be more comfortable with your peers.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren t the ones I invited.
You tell me. I don t know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
Sure know it wasn t me. And if you say it wasn t you then who the hell did, Evelyn?
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn t it? The " O. J. " knife with the not quite retractable blade? Your " Jim Jones Kool Aid " that was exactly that?
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men or just the other men?
You re hurting me.
Sure it wasn t. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills n chills for the kiddies? Don t raise your hands all at once.
Really? Well, let it rip.
The sadistic prick
Where is she?
Asking the wrong person again.
I pose you the same question
If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who d be first and last
That wasn t my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive
Question answered.
Anything, sweetheart, you need only speak
Just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I m going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure
Well, who s the damn thing from?
You didn t think to ask?
No, no, it s just
What?
My wife. Where were we?
And then what happens?
My loss
What?
You re forgetting my lovely wife; she s part of the same winner take all as the rest of you.
Good way to get your head blown off.
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
Then just wait maybe this whoever s got you next on the Asylum s equipment test list. Maybe a literal mind blow inside the " Saturation Chamber. "
Confirming everything we already know
Don t think so. Stay the fuck back.
" Dummy 6 " keeps losing his arm.
The lockdown thing.
It wasn t me.
I was just sitting here it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
No idea. I didn t even know the damn thing still worked!
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife s up in the bedroom the whole time.
Guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Well, then, how bout maybe we call someone?
Believe me, we need to.
The basement but, believe me, you don t want to go down there.
You ll never find it, it s a maze down there.
Not ghosts... at least not what you re thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
This? This is nothing. You ve only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you re tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...... Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Blackburn s dead.
He must ve unsealed the room!
Melissa...?
Melissa, it s Sara is that you?
Keep talking, I ll find you!
I m coming
What s the matter?
What was her name?
It might have been her mother.
What will they tell you?
Thank you. If you told me two years ago we d be living here, I would never have believed it. Do you live around here?
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university. I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
So was I. The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
A few years older, perhaps.
I m sorry.
By killing them?
I don t understand.
I didn t do anything, mommy.
Maybe it was Colleen...
We re going to go someplace new.
Where is she?
Where is she now?
Sure. Did you see the others?
He s blessing the house.
That s father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did. Lived here my whole life.
Don t be afraid!
Yeah I ll look into that tonight.
The place is pretty dusty.
Who knows... we have to get used to living around here. Maybe good help is hard to find.
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
I just, I don t know...
You didn t think much about that before.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
What?
She s asleep. I think that s what I need, too. I m starting to see things.
Were you fooling with the power?
It was in the cellar. Weird.
So what are you saying?
Yeah, I d say some weird things have happened.
Maybe Eliza wasn t so crazy after all.
Well what power lines, Will? Where? Maybe we should call someone about it.
I don t know. Someone who... knows about this kind of stuff.
Voodoo stick? It s nothing like that Will. You re just being cynical.
She has a... friend. Colleen.
I think everything s ready.
She s gone!
Should I...
What?
We re not going.
We re usually successful in detecting the source of most problems. Unfortunately.
We usually find nothing. We ve debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
Maura.
Oh, that s nice...
It was a shame.
Why?
Thank you.
So what does that have to do with Aubrey! Where is she!
What are you getting at!
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other
I didn t do anything... God saved her...
And what would you do?
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
What?
Well what is it!
Yeah? Well, you just struck out. It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way. Not tight skirts. Tight stories.
I know what I saw.
Joey.... Look, you wanna ride? I can go by your place.
OK. Be careful. And lighten up. Story of your life could be right round the corner.
You wanted a story. You got it. Turn on the TV now. And then get your ass down here......
You have to help me. You will understand. And no, you re not dreaming. Do you know where we are?
Captain Spenser. Elliott. I... What the Hell is going on?
And what is... this frozen moment?
Because monster as I was I was bound by Laws. The protocol of Hell. The Box had to be opened to let me out. The truly innocent were safe. That s no longer true. The shell of the beast has been fleshed. What I was is out there, Joey. In your world. Unbound. Unstoppable.
He ll do what he does best. But he ll do it unfettered. He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
Then tell me what to do.
So where is it?
Uh... Hi! Is this... er... Joanne Summerskill?
I want to talk to you. We met... now, listen, don t hang up, OK?... We met at the hospital last night.
Of course tonight. Is that a problem? Like, if you ve got a guy there or something...
Your dream. You said you were having a bad dream.
What is it?
Sorry.
Oh, right. Did he used to...?
That s great.
No... I mean, it s not like great about your dad or anything. It s just I don t dream. Never have.... Maybe it d help if I slept sometime... Just kidding... No, so it s always neat for me to hear about dreams. I m jealous. It s like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
I m trying to quit.
Yes I do. Terri, something awful happened to that boy. I have to find out what it was.
Did you know him?
Taken what?
Wait a minute. He was already... wounded... when you found him?
Wait. Wait. The chains. Where did the chains come from?
Right... That s... er... that s nice of you, Terri. Can I ask? Is it always this... exploratory?
I ll do it!
The bank owns it. But I m working on it.
No. I buy them to impress people. Of course I ve read them.
And he still sits there?
Maybe he thinks it ll come back.
Maybe not. But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
Woah. Wait a minute. Who? The kid?
Would you know this store again?
Yeah. Happening, isn t it?
Buying some drugs, alright?
Then you shouldn t even be around it. You know, it s...
No. No, you don t understand. We re not selling it. It came from here. We want...
No. We want...
Fine. Fine. But can you tell us anything about it?
What else came with it? Anything still here?
Can we see?
I don t know. Maybe.
You re JP Monroe, right?
And this is your club. Great club. I really love it here. Great club.
Thank you for the drink. And the rose. Wow. That s... really nice.
A prize? For what?
The barman? I thought he was called Rick?
I m sorry.
Oh come on. There re lots of girls here who look better than...
Wow. Thank you.
And tomorrow I ll give one to somebody else. Get dressed. Get out.
I m JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
On the contrary. It has everything to do with the world. And our dreams of how it will succumb to us. You enjoyed the girl?
Good. So did I. And that s all...
What!? What are you talking about? Why should I help you?
But how in God s name...
Not quite.
Live and in the flesh. How re you doing, babe?
Will you relax? Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
Really?
No. I mean, really? Because I m concerned for you, sweetheart. I care about you. I guess I miss you. I m sorry we split up. I m sorry I...
Hey, it has been known. C mon Terri, I m not that bad a guy. I have regrets. I d like to put things right. Don t tell me you haven t thought about me. Huh?
I know. I know. It s bad. I m a bad person. But I try not to be, Terri. I really do. And I really miss you.
That s so good to hear, sweetheart. It really is. You know, I.. are you alone?
Good... Good... Look, why don t you come over? You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk. Just see how we both feel?
No. But, as you can see, I m having some work done on it. You found a real treasure for me, Terri. I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up. Put her heart and soul into it.
No. It isn t... she wouldn t... It s like I must have done something wrong, you know? Freaked her out. Just fucked up something good again.
Something like that.
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable... Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
Don t say it, Hawkins. I m incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Show off. Hey, boss tune. " Come Fly with Me. "
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I ll bet you re still the best damn cat burg
Now that you re born again, what do you wanna do? Statue of Liberty? Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix? Seduce some women? Play Nintendo? Bone some chicks?
I read about these people in Newsweek. Where s all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe? Where s Ed Kranepool s autograph? Captain Bob s steering wheel?
Just means it ll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce. You re still the best, I know it.
There goes five seconds... My record s eighteen.
5: 32. " Swinging on a Star. "
What am I doing here? There are so many things I wanna do that aren t this. Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
Oh, not much. Gates just had his tonsils taken out. The hard way.
Morning edition. Seems two thieves " attempted " to steal it last night, but thanks to three " courageous " guards, it will be ready for tonight.
Why try?
You re not thinking of going to...
But I said I was sorry....
You sound disappointed.
Why not just go now?
Anna, I think you better stay....
I can t believe you didn t notice. My weight. I lost ten pounds in Rome
Let s just forget it, I mean...
You re unemployed, Alfie. Boss is dead. Her plan is over.
No, your Eminence. I think he s going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
That s the best kind. A wise woman once said " Polite conversation is rarely either. "
I betrayed a man. A good man. An innocent man. A thief.
A little petting is not the issue!
Oh, why couldn t I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci s crystal and his instructions for the gold machine Aie yi Do we got anything? What of Alex, Hawk s friend, where is his loyalty?
I m sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
Forget about it it was nothing anybody would have done the same thing It s an impulse...
That s what you theenk.
Sure Hudson. Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
Delivers up to ten at night. The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals. It s actually not that an unusual set up. The secret passageway on the other hand....
Nice. But right out of our brochure.
Actually I wrote it. It s a good sentence. It can apply to people.
I don t steal stuffed elephants from little girls. And I buy my own clothes. My life s a little boring...
Secret passageways don t mean as much as they used to. There s a place two blocks east of here. Enzo s. Say 10: 30.
Prison?
How long were you in?
Wow, you were " in the joint. " " Doing hard time. " It s funny, but that excites me. I seem to have a thing for sinners.
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it s been a slow decade. I don t make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
You really went and did it. With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it. Nobody does it better, Hudson. You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
Does everyone in the world know more than me? Jesus, I m just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff..... Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half. Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you re lucky I don t hit women, assuming you are a woman. I m not taking anything for granted anymore.
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
It s that kind of selfish attitude that...
Uh, yeah. Guess I m a wee bit nervous. I m sorry I could only score clergy passports.
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
Trust Leonardo....
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
Hudson, I m afraid I m sticking with God. But you re a close second, tough guy. What is that smile?
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they re going to want to make a deal...
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some " neat " things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you re part of the same car pool.
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I m a regular joe. I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It s just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it s hard to keep coming up with new ones. But now finally I got my new goal. World domination. With your help... Bunny.... quit that!
Market crashes. Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects. We ll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world. In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower. It s one party we d love to poop.
We re here to say, your government was right.
That New York Italian Father made twenty bucks a week son of a bitch. What was our bet? A million?
You could host American Bandstand in here. Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
Whatever. You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads. You think you re God. For all I know, you re probably right. I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is. Man, why didn t you just buy the horse? What am I saying, you did buy it...
If you re pausing for a " thank you, " give it up. So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
Yes.
You certainly do.
You go back, you won t be alone. You ll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate. You re still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but " Alex " will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it ll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
It ll take a couple of years of steady production, but I ll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns. Markets will crash crash. Financial Empires will crumble crumble.
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time table. You re hitting the Vatican to night.
Bastard! If you were a true American.
You just might. I m the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it. At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don t recognize me, I won t be offended.
I used you as a diversion. while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement. Deep down, I guess I was just jealous. You were one incredible thief...
Three minutes, twenty three seconds. If you think I m doing another...
Employer? The president?
I m supposed to fall for that?
Why George, you big softie...
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast. You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we ll be roasting weenies on the beach.
The Dancing Dingus!
Sharp.
With a little jazz.
The Hudswinger!
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
Ah keeps the ol circle turning this ol clock needs plenty o care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money it drives that ol global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a spinnin on roun. Ya see, without that capital fo mation
I don t tell no one nothin lessen they ask. Thatches ain t ole Moses way.
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn t think the Board was that smart.
But then I figured it out: they did it cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
Well, maybe I
It s hardly the same
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were
I m happy enough.
Adenoids?
He didn t offer you money.
Ten dollars? Let s grab a highball!
You ve lost it, Aim. You ve gone soft by the looks of it soft on the dummy from Dubuque
Not at all. You re light as a feather.
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really
Oh, no, really, I
Well, I just don t know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes
Well, I... didn t bother to read the article. I didn t think the picture did you justice.
Or lack thereof?
... Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I m an imbecile?
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
... Why don t I just type this up...
Well, I don t know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should ve come in to face you man to man.
Sure, but she could still have gotten your side for the record!
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast talking career gals, thinks she s one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn t it? She s probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men s clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
Exactly. And I bet she s ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn t they print her picture next to her byline?
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
Let me hold it, or you ll have a real shiner.
... I m sorry.
I know that, Amy.
I understand that you re not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I m not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front not that everyone s buying it.
Oh, I don t blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson s feed tower and look out over the town?
You know, on farm route 17.
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
You don t say.
Every year?
Well, the Hindus say and the beatniks also that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another s coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
Oh! Hello, Amy was it I thought she said, Mamie
Well, I wouldn t call them nincom
Well yes, we re pruning away some of the dead wood, but if
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker
Now, Aim
Now, Aim
Now, Aim
Norville!
Norville, I m sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It s hard to admit when you ve been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to to give me another chance
Just give me another chance, Norville I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can
Phony, huh?
Sez who?
Yeah, well, monkey or not I m still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F. B. I. J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
Why not, it s all true! The board is using this poor guy! They re depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
Whatever. That s what sells newspapers.
Watch it, Archer
You re fools, both of you! It s obvious they re out to crucify Norville! They re trying to destroy him!
Daddy, it s like I been tellin ya
What kind of bar is it if ya can t get a martini?!
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I ve had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I m not about to
This I know, Benny.
Forty fourth floor, and it s very
I
Well, I
Yeah, but, buddy
But, buddy
But, buddy, you were
Geez, I m sorry, buddy
Get up!
Nah, that s all forgotten.
Sure, Mr. Muss uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
Say, that was a swell idea!
And Sid says you stole it!
Norville.
Yes sir...
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must ve mislaid
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Ah, it s New Year s, I m not gonna add to your woes. I m just saying.
Well, why don t ya read it.
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin.
Yeah, yeah, it s the standard resignation boilerplate go down to the second paragraph.
Yeah?
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
Thank you for waking me.
I know, miss. But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you. You settle right back, now, and I ll mix you your coffee.
She must have been beautiful. What happened to her, Alma?
We ll see if we can t make her well, Alma, you and I.
A puff up, I call it. But Miss Jessica always says " brioche. "
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma. They can t cure everything.
What do you mean " doctors that are people "?
Where?
That s nonsense, Alma.
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan the voodoo priest could cure Mrs. Holland?
Ti Misery? What s that?
Alive?
You mean a figurehead.
But they came to a beautiful place, didn t they?
I m afraid so.
Oh, Mrs. Rand
Use your influence with Paul. Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
You ve never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
You don t believe in it?
I don t mean believe, like believing in a religion. I mean, do you believe it has power? Do you think it could heal a sick person?
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been " mindless "...
Wait. Don t draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
I knew you d come. And I knew I d have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn t let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again Jessica cannot be cured.
But you didn t have to come up here.
You must, Betsy. They ll have to believe you.
Yes.
Very well. That means that you have met all Mr. Holland s requirements. Now, as to salary it s quite good two hundred dollars a month.
I m afraid I m not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
No, this is quite final. You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter. He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
A year s contract a trip with all expenses paid that s not so bad, you know.
Yes on the boat.
Is she a doctor?
I like her already.
Thank you. But who sits there?
I went to school in Buffalo. Paul went to school in England.
Mr. Holland?
I don t know. He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
It s my day off.
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren t there shops, restaurants and things?
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
Higher mathematics. Two ounces to a drink three drinks, six ounces.
Why? Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that. Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning just to watch me squirm.
That s right he s playing the noble husband for you, isn t he? That won t last long.
I don t know. I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question. He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
But she s not dead, Wes.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
I m not sure I can make you understand. You know what this is?
I am not a frightened girl.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn t have gone into the tower in the first place.
Nothing really. But you must admit it s an eerie sort of place so dark
I m sorry...
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful
And charming?
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
Yes, he can. But I ve been wondering you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table
But for Wes it must be a temptation to him.
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter. Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won t be long before he is.
I often do.
Why did you come in here?
I love Fort Holland.
You didn t drive her mad.
And instead, I came bringing you nothing.
Help me? How?
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland s life. There s no telling what you may have started with this insanity. Why did you do it?
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me? Why should that mean anything to you?
She was beautiful.
I have no defense. So far as I know it is true.
How do you know I m not? I was cruel to Jessica. When I got to know her when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her something smooth and false that made we want to hurt her.
The night you came to me in this room to comfort me, to help me I turned you away.
I remember words I said to Jessica words mixed like to poison to hurt her, to madden her.
I want you to be safe, Betsy. I want to know you re away from this place home again, where nothing can harm you nothing and no one.
To the asylum?
Why?
You re wrong, Wesley. The guilt is mine all of it.
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Overpriced bomb, cost over  6 million no stars, and no one s into the horror genre these days anyway. I m advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It s disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
Got a meeting uptown.
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
Well, hey, isn t that a one in a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
Don t see how. I think the public s had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me disaster pics. And air hockey.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am. Say, where s the wife?
No thank you. We should be off.
I wasn t star
That shrink the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
So maybe you ll come too?
It s you Ben who needs to talk. I ve had my say, and I m waiting to hear back from you.
And you haven t moved out yet. It s because you re too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision
You want to go?
So early?
Oh. Sure, I Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
I do. I m are you...?
You know Elena, I ve been thinking
I m just sad Ben I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don t know...
No, I didn t mean to sound negative. It was But Ben. What is going to happen with us? Have you
I wasn t accusing you, Ben. It s just that we ve got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
That shirt?
Up to you. I d like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
So what were you doing in the Williams basement anyway?
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
See for yourself.
You think I
What s on your mind? Don t
What do you mean?
Elena, what are you re talking about?
Listen, Elena, if you re gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you re trying to say?
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that s what you mean.
In the car.
I know, I know. I had no idea
Yeah, well, if we d understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
I think we re here and we don t have to stay we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
I m not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else s wife. That s not why we re here, right? We re simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that
I m not.
Well, I m really pleased to hear a confession.
Ben, I ve got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
Sure. I ll try. And we ll talk in the morning?
The phone s out.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Well good. Just confirming. You ll be on the 3: 50 Wednesday afternoon.
All right.
Good.
Fine.
Hnnn.
Yeah.
Uh, dad, you know I m 16.
Sure dad.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
Ben
You re boring me. I have a husband. I don t particularly feel the need for another.
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Have I noticed anything? I m not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you ve probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Birth control.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
What?
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don t know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband
Nah.
What do you think we re doing, dad?
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
Huh?
And why are you still calling me dad? You re forty years old already, and
Advice? I m supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless have you quit your job? They fired you?
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don t mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now
Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty two years we never once contemplated divorce I assume you re talking here about divorce? The very thought
Waiter! Where s my cobb salad? You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I d have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice
That s besides the point. The point is if I d had any sense in me I d have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that s the truth, and here it is, 1972
But what?
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn t tell anyone, including the IRS, and I d of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff
Jesus, Benjamin, you re still as gullible as ever.
Sure is good shit. It s opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other
Don t fret, Benjie, it s
A key party?
I suppose we ll make an appearance.
You couldn t have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen
What the hey. Let s go for a drive.
Jim, maybe we should just go. I ve got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
Well, we can talk about it.
Maybe you just need look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up just a minute, I ll be right back. You ll wait?
Yeah. You?
Sure. Maybe coffee.
With Mikey?
Nobody.
Mom. Are you ok?
You re not a psycho!
I know. They re rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don t want to believe me
I thought you quit the band I never hear you practice anymore.
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
Just curious. If there s a problem, I guess I ll just call you there to interrupt.
It s not a bother.
It s really quite all right.
Thanks for eating it. I don t know why I even pretend I can cook.
Social work?
Educated guess.
Thanks for the lift. If the bike s any bother
Yes.
Yes, it was I ended up
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it I ve never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person
They say you never forget.
You re saying that Christ is the child, and
All well and good But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
That s right.
I would say it sounds like you re trying to get me into bed.
I m sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn t mean to be so rude.
But not too ashamed.
And you re still trying to get me into bed.
I m afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about. Take care.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, cause you re fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
See ya.
Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I m off to get laid. See you.
Do what?
Um, Libbets Casey.
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
Am I right or am I right?
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Major.
Sorry honey. Hell, we ve got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
You going to tell dad?
You know, it s the whip the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
No!
The Idiot?
Great, thanks for the tip.
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
It s like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really
You do? I m glad. Because I feel for you
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
Yeah, well, you ve been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you d get around to Libbets.
That s good, because I don t think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break and like they didn t invite her!
They did it last year too. It s like traditional or something. They ve got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash. Aren t the hugely wealthy sad?
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don t you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
Who said so?
Yeah?
Out.
Sure. Twinkie?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
I don t know.
I don t know.
Huh?
Yeah. Yours?
Maybe. Can t really tell yet.
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
Watching what?
Dad s like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn t been saying much.
Why don t you use the phone downstairs?
Can I come?
With who?
Charles, what time is it?
What time is it?
I m, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you re a very moral person, and
Shit. I can t really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
Hey Sandy.
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p. o. d.
The ones you built?
I have to go to the bathroom.
What are you doing?
Mike s out I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
Are you his girlfriend?
If it wasn t raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
Communist Viet Cong.
Vodka?
One more shot?
Huh?
That s nice. Are you drunk?
But they re so boring. All small stuff.
We already did.
The bartender at Darrow s. He was there Friday night.
Yeah. All over.
Oh. We always have play offs in the middle of the night. It s the best time.
It s okay. Happened a long time ago. He was killed in a fire. In New Mexico.
Then change it.
I don t remember.
I know.
I wish I d had the chance to get to know him better. Take him fishing or something.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
What I saw?
Right. Got lost in the rocks.
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
What time was that?
What?
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house. It s signed. Personally.
That s right.
She flattered me about my writing. Asked if she could visit me. To talk about my books.
How do you mean?
When s that, a week? Two weeks?... We have to figure out a plan of action now.
To do nothing.
Dammit, Will. Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday. Five hours. Asking all kinds of questions...
But he s zeroing in on me. On us. Everyone s talking about it.
Well, I gotta tell you. With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it s rattling hard.
You know I remember that.
Maybe not. We could talk to Buck...
Cut some kind of a deal. I heard that s what Flynn s doing...
Goddammit, Hap. Think about what you re doing...
No. He didn t say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
That s not what he thinks.
What is it?
Huh?
Huh?
She loved me. She wanted to see me every night.
Friday night, at the party what d you fight about?
What kind of stuff?
The other guy?
After that she left the party to go to him.
Ran like hell to go to him...
You don t know.
You re not missing much.
Best friend?
That s a long time.
That s what I said.
You don t know.
What was?
Who?
Who?
What was it?
I said you re going to get a phone call.
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
But she was an attractive girl.
But you wanted to.
Yes.
Yes.
Told you I could write an ending.
There s nothing more to talk about.
Then so was mine...
This an accident, Walter?
No back up.
Yes, and very beautiful.
We had feared we were the only ones...
Are you the leader of tis group?
Ah! You have questions?
Nothing if not vampires...
Surely you know the one who made you...
You mean we are not children of Satan?
Then there is nothing.
Then God does not exist...
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
He knew nothing. He just didn t care.
Your lover.
If you say so. You are innocent.
She is.
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It s forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won t say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
It s already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
You said there were none.
We can do that?
That s what the one who made me said.
Yes... My God...
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
I can t save her.
I don t believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
Louis, I swear I did not.
No.
I knew. I rescued you, didn t I? From the terrible dawn.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don t we?
What night? What do you mean?
I didn t realise.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
It will grow back again!
Stop her Louis!
Does it?
Is that supposed to frighten me?
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
You re a liar. But you upset my plans.
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I ve brought a present for you.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
He jests.
Claudia don t
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I d done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
Don t mock, Claudia...
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
And you never cried
Yes.
It was something hurries... and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
Claudia, you torture yourself.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
What danger?
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
Never.
That s not so.
So you felt it too!
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
Yes...
But if she dies...
What do you mean?
Then my luck would have changed.
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
Give it to me!!!
How do you mean, start?
I can t do it.
You re the devil, aren t you? That s who you are.
I can t go through with it, I tell you.
But why do you want me?
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised
The crucifix
It can t be...
And if I don t?
Fascination...
But how do you know?
I can t.
Paris? You came from Paris?
Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
Come the New Orleans then. There s an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
I m not interested in you. You disgust me. I m interested in my own nature and know I can t trust you to tell me the truth about me.
I don t pretend to know.
NO!!!
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
What are you saying?
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Don t try to speak... it s alright...
That s all past, Lestat.
Don t fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
I can t bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
You know I love the dark. But there s no dark anymore.
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
I tried...
That s what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F. M. radio. F. F. R. C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who
So much the better. I ve got a pocket full of tapes.
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
So shall we begin? What do yo do?
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
We can t begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
You re not lying to me, are you?
Yes.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
Can a vampire feel love?
He did it to make you stay with him!
How could I not? She had to know.
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
But it has. There is no more to tell.
It s over, I m telling you...
No...
Yes...
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
Is that bad?
And, while you re here, our marginally trained, off season staff of five will attend to your every need.
What about a radio?
What the hell would you call this?
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven t exchanged vows, yet?
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I m coming.
No.
Fish are all over the water... Come on, let us take a boat out.
What are you doing in my closet?
Yeah, right whatever.
No.
Would you relax? We ve been dating three months. He ain t stalking your butt.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
He said he d try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
Work hard, huh? He s breaking your heart just because he can. And I don t want to have to say I told you so...
Karla! You promised.
He s cute... And he s got a crush on you... But...
Don t even think about it.
Yes.
Yes.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn t want to involve anybody else.
No, you re not.
You re okay. Thank god.
Oh, that s Will. He s a friend. You d like him.
Ray, we re just friend.
Can t what?
No, you don t have to be sorry. I m the one
Oh... it s not working right. You re home early. Did I scare you?
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
Who?
I don t know.
I m fine.
I m fine.
It was in a church... it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn t had one for months.
It s... the anniversary. That s what s going on... Take it easy on yourself.
To get out of Southport?
I m okay.
What?
What if I don t have anything happy from childhood... Sorry, I can t relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute... Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface to air missiles over the internet. Planes use O rings... which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
Sure. It s fine. As long as you don t snore.
It s... him.
I scared you I crossed the line
Hey, you don t have to appologize to me. I m the one. I understand. I m going to take a walk and dry off.
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
He s in it with Willis?
Me, me, me. It s always about you. I m having bad dreams. I can t sleep. I m not doing well in school. I m having trouble with my boyfriend.
I don t think so. It s pretty crowded.
Why?
Hello?
Hey
How s Julie?
Well, Karla, what re you doin at home over the long fourth weekend?
How d you like to win a Magic 96. 7 Quicky Getaway?
Oh, no... Did you say Rio?
How much?
Tell me this ain t the bar scene.
Not anymore.
Julie thinks there s a dead guy in the closet.
And so could you crazy fool.
Must have missed the sign.
How s the water?
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression
What is up with that weirdo?
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn t she?
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I m Oliver Davis. To be perfectly frank with you, we didn t expect to find anyone living here.
Drunk again?
Our friend, Poseidon, didn t use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
He won t even know you re there. He is delirious.
Don t bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I ll be working late. I can hear any movement down here.
Go ahead. I ll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
They were gore before I came here.
All the graves?
We will know when the next one sickens. Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
That s impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
No. She shall not be left here.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Sharp, shiny teeth and they creep up to your bed
Poor Cathy
She has never mentioned her family.
In the morning go. I ll not die until then  I ll not die   I ll watch  they shall not hurt you.
What an odd question!
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
But one must love a father.
That should decide it or you
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can t think of anything else.
It was, the plague
Her name is Thea?
Her family name?
She s not too well.
Nothing, really. She s been under a great strain the journey the battle
This girl Thea  is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter s companion. Now, sir, if you ll excuse me, I ll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
Hero?
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur. What do you expect after a battle?
There s no one there  nothing but the caves and the dead.
It doesn t seem to bother you much, General.
Oh, now   now look here  
I can t understand that.
Plague? There s no possibility of that, is there?
But the war, the army   they need you.
We still don t know that it s the plague  
How did she die?
In a way this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
You are my friend.
If I told you   you wouldn t believe me but this much I can tell you   the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend s advice an old man s advice leave her alone 
Listen to what I say
Come  you ll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
I don t know. Everything s so mixed up
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I m afraid of him.
The General threatened me.
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
I can t.
He hates all my race.
Well, you re begging, and that s a whole lot worse.
Then foreclose!
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven t you any romance in you?
Who?
All right   all right.
Carter   bank examiner.
Merry Christmas.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Yeah, very funny.
Well, I did, didn t I? You didn t go through with it, did you?
What are you, a mind reader or something?
Well, who are you, then?
Odbody... A S 2. What s that A S 2?
I wouldn t be a bit surprised.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I d get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren t you? What happened to your wings?
I don t know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
Only one way you can help me. You don t happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
Oh, that s right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
I found it out a little late. I m worth more dead than alive.
I said I wish I d never been born.
It isn t me!
You ll see a lot of strange things from now on.
No.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Made what?
No, of course not.
Don t you understand, George? It s because you were not born.
Yes, George?
Oh, well, I can t...
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
The Building and what?
I know. I know.
Hiya, George!
Okay. Three twenty Sycamore?...
Of course it s the place.
Mother...
When d you see him last?
Well, what happened to you?
Want to give my flower a drink.
Will you try to get some sleep?
I know   I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it ll be a whole garden.
Zuzu   Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I d give the kids a treat.
Yeah   old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you re going to make it after all.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
No charge.
I m working across on a cattle boat.
Oh   Welch. That s what I get for praying.
I m all right.
Yes, sir.
No.
Yes   charge.
Aw, get going!
Aw, forget it.
I m going to miss you, too, Pop. What s the matter? You look tired.
Oh...
I wonder what s eating that old money grubbing buzzard anyway?
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
He s pretty young for that job.
Maybe you were born older, George.
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you ve decided what you re going to do when you get out of college.
Still after that first million before you re thirty.
You see what I mean, don t you, Pop?
Couldn t want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we re going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Come on, George, let s hurry.
Say, where s Mother?
Hiya, Marty. Well, it s old home week.
What s that?
Hello, Violet.
Nothing.
Huh?
Here, now, you re broke, aren t you?
Yeah   yeah... sure I will.
I m not interested in your book. I m talking about the Building and Loan.
Would I? You re not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Well, Mr. Potter, I... I... I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I... I just... I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty four hours to think it over?
I d like to do that.
Have you notified the police?
I can t get hold of him. He s in Europe.
They don t have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You re the only one in town that can help me.
I don t like coconuts.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn t know me.
You ve passed me on the street almost every day.
Uh huh.
Neither am I.
I guess I m not quite the football type. You... look wonderful. You know, if it wasn t me talking I d say you were the prettiest girl in town.
I don t know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
You may kiss my hand.
In that place?
Come on, tell me.
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
Have you made up your mind?
Didn t you tell her?
Tuesday.
Do you like it?
Would you rather leave?
Don t you like her?
Oh, it s just marriage in general you re not enthusiastic about, huh?
I feel like a bootlegger s wife. Look!
Please, let s not stop, George.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Hi.
To keep from being an old maid.
I didn t want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
Yeah, just started.
Oh, she s got a cold. She s in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn t want to crush it so she didn t button up her coat.
Just a cold. The doctor says it s nothing serious.
Yes, I called him right away. He says it s nothing to worry about.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you re real!
You have no idea what s happened to me.
I ve eaten.
What plates?
With the right wind, 15 20 knots.
How fast is enough?
Someone pop your balloon?
What d you do? Memorize the tide tables?
Is she responsible for the punch?
Yeah.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
We better go back in.
That s awful.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
Listen to Andy, Sean.
Let s just go sailing, okay?
N o o o o o o....
No! It s still there!
It s still there!
Aren t you off duty?
Happy to do it.
I just made it up. It means, " Get me out of there. " What the hell s that?
Abandoned? It s a little early in the season for that.
If I had a  100, 000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn t leave it anchored alone in the channel.
In here.
You didn t miss much. Christ, what a mess.
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
What camera?
If there is, develop it!
Not the drugstore!
The drugstore s closed? What the hell time is it?
No place special. Just hanging out.
Every day?
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
What about tennis? Riding? fixing up old cars? Bartending?
Okay, not bartending. Why on the water every day?
Look, humor the old man just be careful.
Oh, c mon.
Yeah?
I kind of had plans....
Hey, come on....
Pop. I m sorry.
Sean s still out there.
You said something about a camera.
Did you get any pictures?
What else you got?
Come on, Phil, don t jerk me around.
Me neither.
Too late, it s written.
Is that what it is?
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him? You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could ve been injured what if somebody de cides to sue us? That could ruin us.
You don t make enough.
What s that supposed to mean?
Come on, let s check the bite radius.
Bite radius. You know, the size of the mouth?
The Shark s mouth.
We don t know that, do we?
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
That s it.
Is there one in these waters?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Jesus, don t quibble with me. I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
That s it? Probably? Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Sound?
So there s one around here.
Can t you tell?
Look can Great White Sharks communicate? Send out signals, or something? You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Late.
Why?
And how. I thought you wouldn t respect me.
Fooling around?
Door s locked.
It s good with coffee.
Because, I m in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat He s another one.
Boat nut. What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
For me?
Oh, perfect a 75 per cent family affair. Where were you?
Careful. What s wrong?
Nothing, huh?
Use the little brush there. Why were you at Santos?
Oh. Want to talk about it?
Do you?
It was bad, wasn t it.
Are you going to be able to sleep?
That s great.
What d I say?
Then that s what I meant. Fired. Canned. Out on my fanny. The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police. Just like that.
No sweat. A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale s without waiting six hours for the ferryboat... we re surrounded by water here, you realize that? Me, surrounded by water... Ridiculous.
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn t see it. Not like me. Not like the poor son of a bitch who snapped this li l picture... He s out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
... Everybody wants the job. No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks. Fine. He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me. Call me in New York... tell him to kiss my ass....
Fired me! I m not a hysterical man. I m responsible. I know what I saw....
Turn in the car. Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit faced and punch your boss.
Very impressive ceremony. Good speech.
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
Of course. Look I ve got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
I got a feeling. I have to act on it you can understand that, can t you?
We have to do something.
I know, I know....
It s still a good idea.
Please, Larry there s good reason. Those water skiers....
Two of them are still missing!
Bullshit? I ll give you bullshit there s a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
Someone has to do something.
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
Dad! Dad!
That s you.
Now I really want to see it.
Seventeen. She s a senior.
Waiting for Andy.
Sure. They like to play. We may see some today.
Ready?
Help! Help!
Nope.
Who d you ask?
You re crazy. She s Ed s girl friend.
That s a crock of shit.
Shut up.
What s that mean?
Next week.
Nope.
Just like this.
The tide s running. It ll take us to the light.
They ll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
And second?
Wait a minute. Promise me something.
That you ll put down a blanket. I ve got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom s getting uptight about them.
What Kids? Who went out?
Mike? Our Mike?
Figure they split?
Until we find something.
Power line.
Untangle it and let s go We don t need a blackout on the island.
It s an island, near here, with a lighthouse. We sometimes hang out there, you know....
I m not sure I can.
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
That s not it. My dad told me not to go.
No.
If we beat them, they can both go home stag! Single O! Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
Uh. Well. Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
When are we going out? You and me?
You always go with Andy.
Eat Cheerios.
Yeah.
Maybe.
No.
Quiet! Shhh!
Brody s riding his tower.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
So? So?
I m only walking him. You caught him. You have to be exhausted.
No one s ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
With those camera lights and...
No, it will be too much distraction. I don t want that many people in the water. I ll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
Can t help you, Mike. Don t have the manpower.
You buying?
Yeah. Down there.
No.
She can take care of herself. She doesn t need you.
How many sharks have you killed?
What is it, 97 days?
Hope I make it through both.
They re acting very strange suddenly.
Don t forget you have your brother.
Don t let him get you. Just continue your patterns and pretend he s not around.
Honey, I gotta go.
Everything s going wrong. I m having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before. I can t get him to respond.
I don t know. I can t understand it. Something s bothering them.
... Hutton. He really pisses me off.
I don t like what he does.
He doesn t need the money. He inherited a fortune. He kills for kicks. TV battles between non predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
I can t leave now. We taking Sean out?
No, you don t need all that starch. You re getting too fat.
Look, Michael... you don t have to come.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
No.
Hi, baby.
They just wanted to say hello.
That s a lot of ground to cover.
Oh, yeah. Very.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
That we swim.
Michael, the sub s dead.
Up.
Make up your mind.
I talked you into this?
Are you coming...?
I think so. I m not sure... Are you?
God, they re horrible. I hate them. Did you see its eyes? How black they are? The look in them?
Yes.
I know I can capture it.
I got it on sale. A real steel.
What s that?
Should protect you a little, from the compression. If that thing gets ahold of you.
It s easier to lure sharks at night.
No.
Sounds wonderful.
Get some sleep. And tell Sean I m sorry.
How s your patient?
You don t.
What s up?
Okay.
... Mean through the tubes?
No, I m not going through there.
I m not going to walk through that shark arcade.
I don t want to see them, Kathryn.
... He ought to put him in here.
So tell Calvin.
Hydrophobia...
I have to get out of here.
I can t take water, Kathryn.
It s a shark s tooth!
That s just it, Michael. We don t!
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
That s why they re always moving. They have to have it.
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he s gonna be all right.
Who s going to do it?
Michael, you re not going down there.
But you
I want that shark, Kathryn.
On the telly. We re to film him for the evening news.
I just did. Can you make them do tricks?
Fine. Have them do some.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
I thought they were clever.
No, no. That won t do.
Well, I have to get this into the networks. If you can t do it, you can t do it, that s all.
Sharks are man biters, Mister Hutton. Not man eaters
I think we can capture it. I d like to try.
I ve handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
No!
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
It s one of the world s greatest creatures.
Well, then I m going to film it.
Shark bait. Draws them over for closeups.
We re taking that shark alive!
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Afraid I can t do that.
Still sleeping.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Thanks for helping.
Why are you?
So do I. But for different reasons.
Skillful? I missed my first shot.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
You re a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade. Now you re helping to nurse it back to life.
We re all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans. By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
Get ready to go.
She, Mister Hutton.
They still seem nervous.
Don t blame yourself.
Not good enough.
Sure.
He s missing.
Sure. No problem.
How you doing, Kelly?
Yeah, from Boston.
Massachussettans aren t.
... Massachussettans aren t.
I don t know, it depends.
Depends on big brother.
Are you really?
That s too bad. I don t like water. I don t like being around in. I never go in it.
Did you see me?! Wasn t I terrific?
I don t know, what else is there?
The one that goes underwater?
No, Kelly, I don t want to...
Not for me. I don t go in the water, remember?
No, think of something else.
Now what s this do?
It s okay, Sean.
Hold still, damn it!
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Now what?
Don t you dare.
What?
That?
Calvin said it was all right.
Yeah, poor bastard.
Hey, I don t want to hear.
Buzz off.
Yeah? Well, in that case, have a drink.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
What the hell s there?
Polar bears in Georgia???
Oh...
How come you re so brave with all this stuff?
Yeah, tradition s a bitch, ain t it?
Five hundred yards.
No way.
It s not closing, Mike.
I know. But we show it s not closing.
Damn! You sonuvabitch! Look at you!
Got a job for me?
Sharks???
Great. I got one B, two C s, and eight incompletes.
He needs a haircut.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring. Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac Man games.
Booked them all at Baskin Robbins.
Who s grown up?
I want to see Kathryn.
Something wrong?
It s not that easy. Worked construction every summer to get through school. Three years apprentice in the park s engineering department, and two years to build all this. Finish school first, Sean. Then make up your mind. If you still want to work with me, we ll have plenty of time.
This company s expanding. They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California. I think I m gonna be going to Waco.
Tell Dad we re getting married in Las Vegas. In one of those chapels. He can meet us there.
We re in love.
No, really. I ve never met anyone like her before. This is it.
That bugger moves fast.
I wouldn t mind going down with her.
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
But you always let me....
Did you hear what I said? Come inside....
Yes, I did.
He was doing his job....
No way....
We need milk....
We need beer....
My brain is shrinking. There s only so much room.
We don t have anything straightened out. You re uptight about something... what s wrong?
Then don t come any closer.
No....
I have work....
What s wrong? What happened?
She could have been killed... You knew and you didn t tell us... You let your mother think....
How could you do that? Your own daughter....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...? About spending so much time working in the water?
I can t help it....
I shouldn t interfere... My mother in law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
You caught me....
Whatever happens next.....
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn t... I don t know why he wants me....
We ll be there....
You rigged it... You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
Stop what?
Serves you right. Will you please stop....
I m hungry, Mom....
You check it....
He heard that.
You can stay in my room.
What?
Come on, Mom, you can t be serious....
I m just getting started....
It picked Sean... It killed your father....
Don t be such a Grandma... I was always climbing something....
Okay.
Mom, please don t start that again....
I m not going to quit now....
I don t like him chasing around after you... I don t trust him....
You re not a pain in the ass....
I m pleased. I really am. Really....
You just got here....
Trying to write our report....
I have to get this finished.
I m not unhappy. Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little. It ll work out....
There s nothing to worry about....
I don t want to talk about that.
Why d you come out here?
Promise me....
First time for everything is the best. After that you know too much and it s never quite the same.
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
It could have been an accident....
I m not saying you re wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
Boss day off... Take the wheel....
Sure you can....
Where do I pull off...?
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon. Went down in the jungle....
Got picked up by a tribe of head hunters....
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
No, you re not....
Sharks come and go, Ellen. People don t have anything to do with it....
A big one....
You re not going to bet it all....
I have my own little island.
That s hard to imagine....
You re always taking time off....
What?
Won t you get in trouble...?
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
Why?
I m sorry... I....
I have coffee in the thermos.
How come it bumps up and down when there s no road?
Yes I can....
You sure you know how to do this.
It ll come for the plane. It s attracted to metal. The electro magnetic impulse....
Still chasing fish?
We ll be done pretty soon....
Inch by inch....
She s a tough lady....
She s had a lot to deal with... She needs time....
Feathers all over the place....
I ll get her. Have a good Christmas, Matt....
Stop busting my hump....
Will you leave me alone...?
I m separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
The females have eggs....
If we had some decent money, I d be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
The readings suck....
I made them, man....
You didn t stick them on right....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
You leave me high and dry... You come back looking like a zombie....
Shouldn t pick on that. Sorry. I m sorry about your brother....
Put me down....
Forget it....
They put bombs on dolphins....
It s not a bad life, Jake....
Stop busting my hump....
What?
We don t write up anything until we re done....
When we got the grant....
When I signed on....
We got it together, Jake....
We have at least three months work left. We can t write a report... We don t know enough....
My name goes on that report. It s a half assed job, I don t get my doctorate. Neither do you....
What she s got. Nine knots....
What?
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
How long has he been here...?
Hoagie.
Half the pilots down here fly drugs... He s always going off....
I am... You must know something about him....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don t ride again....
I didn t ask you to....
I m going down, Jake....
I live to hear the sound... You all right?
Nothing... Hey Michael... You know I was thinking about yesterday. Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
Maybe he only likes white meat....
' It was so ugly... It was so big.... '
' Snuck up on me.... '
Don t be so down, man. Money s gone... Shark s gone... We re back to conch... We ve got it made....
You ll be the eternal tropo... The old man and the sea... Know the words to this one? Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white... '
You don t like my voice...?
I ve got to get to her....
It ll work....
The big picture... If we can t get him to swallow it, we ll shove it up his....
No way....
We need it to eat electronics, man... Not you. Get it on me....
Here it comes....
Here comes the cow ca ca....
I told you....
Oh, Jake...
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
I m training to....
When he has a pillow over his head....
Gone to Ben Masters place. Cow tipping.
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows. They re not giving milk.
Yes.
What?
Oh no
No, Jakie, no. I I I
Yeah?
Oh, no. I wouldn t go...
I m afraid it s the " van " again.
Is it your vehicle?
Only me and Mom..
I hope I m not intruding?
The dogs?
O. K.
Not too good in daylight..
Because, don t get into it...
Why don t you throw them all away, and smoke none?
Maybe?
I am stopping smoking...
How d you do it, old man?
Worrying clicking picking You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
Why don t you dump the " Fat Lady? "
O. K. and I m not in love with this fukker? That s how I feel about him.
Thank Christ we got a witness.
No, you didn t.
No way.. not me, Mister. I m not going up there again. Might find someone s prick in a hot dog roll.
So am I. But where s my money?
Pay me, and I shut up.
Then give me that Zippo.
I need some security. I don t trust you anymore.
It s not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem ber the old Bum s lungs?
How come the F. B. I. don t put anya this together? They work ed over " Jennifer " for months?
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn t even have a driver s lic ense?.. She s untraceable, John.. You need fifty detectives on this.
Listen to me saying what?
For a dead dog?
All but.. How you doing?
You looked like you did?
I never knew about the sailor the ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
Just makes to so God damned mad..
Alright, she wasn t lying about the van. But it could have been any van? Any little foreign diesel?.. She s blind, Bro.. It s sad.. She s pro bably lonely, and you re a nice guy to have around.. But you re getting far too far into the element, Brother..
You don t need me to tell you what hap pens when you get emotionally involved?
I m not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen  it s happened? " Good bye, Princess, "  the same night she gets attacked? That s a tough one to swallow, Bro?
You don t really believe this?
I m asking it.
I m sick of this toy town shit.
I dunno what I d do with your help. I ve gotta take her out of there..
Hey, John, don t start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
I m going up to the institute.
I guess by the bed.
Bits.
You ain t going in alone?
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen nifer had raven black hair.
I thought it was Taylor s case?
Coz this is a major  we re closer to this bastard than anyone s ever been.
He hasn t hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast.. She s probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
No.
No, Sir.
It s her hand. Her scars. Her dog. Her dog s shot. And she s missing.
If you re not gonna hear me, Chief..
We have a multiple homicide, Sir..
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
Three or four.
Once.
That s bullshit,
And did they?
I want Serato.. Why can t I have Serato?
You ain t talking to no one, till you calm down.
My pleasure.. Who s Popeye?
I think he would have if he could have been trying to get me up here long enough I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire..
No.. But we have a theory..
What are you looking for?
You put it in there.
Don t lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment you gave him the whole damned case!
Bullshit.
Hey, c mon, country boys, let s all line up and hear the expert.
I ve heard you call him Freddy.
I m afraid I can t give you an ans wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex plained to your secretary, we re do ing a lotta looking, but we re not even sure it s her we re lookin for..
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
As she s a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
I m Mr Berlin. Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that s O. K.? O. K... I d like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing s too trivial, O. K.
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
No.
Yes.
No, just a minute or two.. I knocked on your door no one home, so I followed the music..
I gotta admit, you re one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a " hollow car? "
Hamlet. Have you read it?
No.
Well, I m glad we got the conver sational side of lunch over with.
Was. But I don t like to talk about it.
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It s something that happens to a lota cops. We don t wanna talk about that.
Yeah, that ll do.. Is that " Hamlet? "
Do you pray?
You said, you were in the bad lands?
Have you known her long?
How d you know what I m like?
Really? What did he say?
He said that? What else did he say?
Which is what?
I know.
I don t think so.. He said the police had been calling.. want ed to ask me some more questions..
No I m not.
It s not possible right now.
I m going back to the institute.
I know you re trying to help me, but you don t understand.
Why does he want to kill me?
I can t identify him..
I know about alcohol, John.
I don t want them to arrest you.
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
Yes, Sir.
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
Wasn t frozen, was it, Sergeant?
You find something curious in that?
Then let me put your mind at ease.. Firstly, Amber isn t " blind " she has some useful vision and second, this isn t a prison, it s a college of higher education a severe vis ual disability doesn t mean my stud ents don t value their independence as much as anybody else and Amber was a very independent young woman She decided to leave so she left..
Two or three years ago.
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi professional model. But a policeman s wife she wasn t. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
He s not that bad of a guy..?
Alright, guys. We stop this now.
He has?.. What s he doing here?
Don t annoy me, Travis.
Whatta you mean, " horrible? "
Sooner... or later... I ll have to stop.
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket. Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Ugh!
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
That s right.
Okay, this is working.
Don t worry about it I never told you what I thought of that memo either
You lost your head, it happens. I m so fuckin jazzed! Listen. I m going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
What do I do? How do I spin this?
Could you just stop moving?
Look, I don t want a
What was our deal when we first got together? Brutal truth, remember?
No.
There is something missing here.
Hey, man, tonight I m going to teach Ray about jazz.
Yeah, how d it go with Sportboy?
I see what you re saying.
" It s okay to eat fish, cause they Don t have any feelings...
Just be friendly and say " no comment. "
Oh come on
Oh. Hi. I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I m
Hmm. Pretty good.
Well, take care.
No no. I knew.
You think so?
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
Give me your number. I ll call tomorrow. I m just a little. I m a little insane right now. But it s going to be great.
Hello?
We are?
Well, I m happy for you.
Thanks.
He s asleep. Watch out for that lamp.
Better now than later. We ll still be friends. I m dying here.
Do you have something to drink?
We will be fine!
Sorry about this hand. You know that feeling you re not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow s embarrassment?
Oh shit. You said " boss. "
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
No, I do. I feel like Clarence Thomas. I m like... harrassing you... right now.
Happy. He said " happy? "
You don t have to explain.
Yeah, what happened there.
I m relieved you said that.
Oh good.
Yeah guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults no offense buster. You meet Chad the nanny?
What?
Same to you.
Right. I ll come in.
Fine, I just
This rig? Phht. No problem.
No no. Don t do that. Don t say that if you don t...
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
What
Tell me let me help
Well I m not the guy who s going to run. I stick.
You want...
Dorothy what if I m just not built that way?
I know. I watched it. I sort of know it by heart.
Oh please. My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, " responsible "... if one of us doesn t say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don t we call this next road trip what it is. A nice long break.
So this break... is a break up.
If you d read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
Dotty this is not " guy. ". This is a " syndrome. " It s called Early Midlife, About To Marry, Hanging Onto The Bottom Rung Dear God Don t Let Me Be Alone, I ll Call My Newly Long suffering Assistant Without Medical For Company Syndrome. And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
No kidding. I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
Thank you.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing. You re very responsible with Ray and you know it s not right for a little boy to hear some strange man s voice in the house.
Good.
Please, if I start talking
Well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten point two million dollars. Playing in the state where you grew up.
Ten seconds, Rod.
Told myself if he shows up, we ll stick with him.
I ll give it everything.
Said who? Sugar?
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Now you want Arizona dollars.
Mmm. Hmm.
Yes.
Yeah. And it might have even worked too.
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Get some sleep. See you tomorrow.
Call me tomorrow.
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow! You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Huh?
Well, boo fucking hoo.
No.
Another drink please.
Uh, not today, but
I understand your anxiety.
That s your word?
Great word. Towel?
Forget it. Forget it.
Won t happen. I m strong in my mind.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
How do I know?
No, I don t know.
But I sure don t like that she s leaving.
No. A real man does not shoplift the " pooty " from a single mom.
No.
I m a little worried
Take care, okay? You re my entire client roster.
What s that supposed to mean?
I don t know how s " dedication " for an answer?
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
No, you re
Then why d you get married? I m asking you as a friend.
No, I m going to answer you. You want an answer? I ll give it to you. Loyalty. She was loyal. Everything grew from there.
Damn right.
Look. I m happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you. Are we really " friends? "
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our " friends " hats on
Fine.
We still having dinner in L. A.?
What
Jerry Maguire. SMI.
I think you ll know when you see him at the gate.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
So our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
A year and a half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I ve always hit a wall at 18 months. Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months. It s like ka boom. The curse of 18 months.
Exactly. And the world does not need another 35 year old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
To the pools. Now she s Miss Rock Climber, and I m more the Non Rock Climber, but we re hiking up through the pools and there s a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I m a little nervous, I m lagging behind, and she says to me, get this " Hurry up, klutz. "
How sad
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod s poster and putting it where people can see it!
Don t be silly.
I m freakin out. Oh God I m
" Stay calm? " I m freakin...
Marcee this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
You okay?
You ll lose.
I m over it. Now I want all my clients and yours too.
And I ll get em.
No.
Wait. I want to tell you more about my dad.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
Funny.
I m scared. What is it?
Can you be quiet?
Shut up!!!
What is it?
What?
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
Twenty, twenty fire pounds. I ve been swimming at the Y.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
Because " Dr. Grant " isn t looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
Oh, don t worry about that.
Nothing.
Nothing.
No, it s...
That one time was just the bumper.
When did you have it last?
You couldn t have made that jump.
How would you have helped Eric? He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
You mean it?
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
He loves you too.
Thirty thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
I thought you were an expert.
We ll be broke in four weeks.
It s a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It s the future of paleontology.
They re here.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Obviously a superpredator. Suchimimus. that snout.
Baryonyx?
I don t remember that on InGen s list.
Alan, I want to tell you that I m so sorry about the...
NO!
Raptors, mostly.
I try not to.
You think they could talk to each other?
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
Let me know if I can help, Alan. You  re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
A well accepted theory.
In Costa Rica?
Which one do you prefer?
Yeah.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that s where they d start.
Are you sure?
I want to be an astronaut.
But then you never get to go in space.
You should.
No. I couldn t see.
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you re the best. You ve seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
I have never been on this island!
Dr. Grant, we re not leaving without our son.
Well, we don t exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it. I m touched. Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
Just a little bit too much, I think.
You broke that idiot s jaw for no reason other than your boredom. Tell the truth, Roland. Aren t you even interested in knowing this expedition s quarry?
Minimal.
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it s only impossible. God save me from academics.
Former academic. Now I actually make things. I don t just talk.
It doesn t matter what I think.
It s the lawyers. The lawyers are finally killing me.
Well? Didn t it all seem a trifle compact to you?
The hatchery, in particular? You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that s a thousand embryos for every single live birth. Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor. We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight some miles from Nublar.
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B. We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did. For four years I ve fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
John...
I m not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there s never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
That doesn t say a thing about T rex, they could have been rogues. Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
I don t even know this woman.
Stop saying fantastic. Where are you going?
My vacation is over in a week.
I m your daughter all the time, you know. Not just when it s convenient.
Which one?
That was about a year ago.
No. Richard talked to his parents.
Out of the question. You d miss the gymnastics trials. You ve been training for that for a year.
This is nothing like Austin. Forget about it.
Where does it say that?
I m fine, I m fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
Okay.
My father s. 600 Nitro Express. Made in 1904. Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant. 8700 foot pound striking force.
Forty yards. Less, maybe. I assume it ll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep. All the jeep had done was startle the bull s calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Rex won t be any different. It ll come.
You ve broken its leg!
Do me a favor. Don t pretend for a second that you and I don t know the truth. You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
You cost me my livelihood. That on which I relied to support my children.
I didn t tell anything, I told the truth.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn t a corporate maneuver, it s my life.
It was a payoff and an insult. InGen never
You re going too?
Our chance to do what?
It has a broken leg!
No.
Where s Kelly?
We re sure as hell not going back out there "
It ll hold!
I have to find Kelly!
Look, we have two choices. We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we re waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
What s that?
Why did you come here?
Why should they?
It ll still exit if they go on not knowing, won t it?
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
But why?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice principal.
Funded by whom?
It has to be temporary, something that ll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
Are you insane?!
They will come after me. But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick s tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
What?!
Maybe. Maybe not.
What?
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since 91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
Women. Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
You think this is all a joke?
Ian s a very good friend of mine.
You re sure we have to?
So how much for our first tour. Two no shows and one sick triceratops.
The door security systems are shutting down.
What now?
Find Nedry! Check the vending machines!
I will not do it. You ll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It s all pretty standard stuff, until this one
Uh about two million.
How would we cut off the lysine?
Remember viable embryos. They re no use to us if they don t survive.
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry. The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
These are dilated. Take a look.
Are you sure?
There s only one way to be positive. I need to see some droppings. I have to see the dinosaur s droppings.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
But you can t think through this one. You have to feel it.
Why?
Good! Keep going, now. The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
They died together?
Yeah, I know, you know... kids. You want to have one of those?
Oh, Ellie, look. They re noisy, they re messy, they re sticky, they re expensive.
They smell.
They do smell. Some of them smell.. babies smell.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
The Cretaceous.
Yeah, plenty. Some of them can t walk!
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
We were right!
Not just every six weeks.
The undigested state of the berries because it s
Like birds. What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs
Which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while
Barfs them up
You can t hold it by yourself!
The fences are electrified, right?
Why not?
I get ah
And scary.
When people try to control things that it s out of their power
I m still not clear on Chaos.
It changed. Why? Okay, back over your wrist. Because and here is the principle of tiny variations the orientations of the hairs
On your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin
Microscopic never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome. That s what?
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Must go faster, it s getting closer must go faster!
Shut up.
He sends his apologies.
He had to leave early to be with his daughter. She s getting a divorce.
Grant? You ll never get him out of Montana.
What are we looking for?
I can t believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
In a box under my seat.
Yeah.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems. Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich. Everyone in the world s got a right to enjoy these animals.
That s conservative, of course. There s no reason to speculate wildly.
Hey! Where are the brakes?
Listen, ahh
Tim. Which car were you planning on
Tim, are you okay?
Yes it is.
No.
This is impossible. How am I going... I can t make it. This is... it s about fifty feet.
That s a good idea.
I doubt it.
I don t know. What do you call a blind dinosaur?
You got me.
It s good protein. Come on, Lex. Why don t you touch it? Look at his nose.
But my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
You re crazy! I m not gonna jump!
You have no idea.
Why?
You haven t touched didn t touch anything. We re stopping. We ve stopped.
Machines hate you?
You want to talk about this?
The kids okay?
Kids get scared.
I didn t say I was scared.
I know.
You re sure?!
We gotta do something.
For today, I guarantee it.
I, uh, don t really know any. We
What kind of opinions?
No, I m sorry, that wouldn t be possible. We ve just discovered a new skeleton, and
This would be an awfully unusual time
Sorry! It s kind of a ride!
Shhh I m right here, Lex. I m going to look after you. I m going to help your brother. I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
It s safe.
Go that s the way we re going to go. What do you say?
Oh, I hate the other kind.
I ll stay awake.
Please!
Timmy, let go! You re gonna have to let go! Count to three. I ll catch you.
You re gonna get electrocuted electrified!
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
Codswollop! Ian, you ve never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
John, John.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn t stop to think if they should. Science can create pesticides, but it can t tell us not to use them. Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can t tell us not to build it!
Hold on this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam. Dinosaurs had their shot. Nature selected them for extinction.
I m sorry about your financial problems. I really am. But they are your problems.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis. I really will not.
I don t blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
I ll keep an eye on it. Maybe it ll swing south like the last one.
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
Thanks for the presents.
Why did you do this?
They don t bother me.
They re not monsters, Lex. They re just animals. And these are herbivores.
What?
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety eight percent in the last ten years?
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
Logging? We ll need an environmental impact study for that...
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
Yeah?
You have a map.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to
I really think we should go back...
I m not sure I d call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
What?
 Krueger ...
Your... client is being booked right now. He ll be in cell five.
Shit. We re still putting the victim list together. You ll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don t expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months. You re about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
Who s chest?
Take it easy, Ruby... it s all right. Now, try to think clearly... don t you mean  Jason s  hand... don t you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton s throat?
Because everyone knows he s guilty...
He s fucking nuts.
No. When you put me on the stand, I ll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality. And he doesn t sleep.
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation. Not to mention he s a bed wetter.
Great. Battling head doctors. We ll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
So?
None of that s true?
So, what are you saying... that he didn t kill all those people?
I don t " rationalize " anything. I m his lawyer he s my client. That s all.
No. You ve told me all I need to know.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
That s pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
Insomnolesence...
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he s unconscious. If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
There s a pizza place over on Market.
That s open to debate.
Me too. I m drunk.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here. Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six inch blades.
That s right. The murders in the eighties were never solved. But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Don t you see? Jason was  asleep . And he was dreaming the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger s come out of Jason s chest. There has to be a connection.
Yeah, what is it?
That doesn t make sense.
Not yet.
Great. When can you do it?
I ll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it. Let me know what happens.
How s that possible?
I don t know... but I think he s pissed.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
And if he s not?
 Neurolar . It s a stimulant it s also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
Ten CC s of this shit and you won t be dreaming about anything.
About ten minutes.
What is it really?
I don t know what you could have read.
In magazines nobody reads.
Did you?
Naturally? that s not the word I would have chosen.
I haven t got the energy. I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
Success or nothing?
A man must eat And drink.
There is one thing I d like you to tell me.
What made you think I d be able to get you into the Castle?
An empty tomb?
Yes.
Another one?
What an extraordinary request!
Then its authority is in doubt.
I gave it to him yesterday.
No, I left it in his office.
I ve never seen him. I don t believe there is a keeper of the files.
He has it, he just hasn t noticed it yet, all right?
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing
Your credibility yes, it s well known.
Say what you like no one pays the least attention.
Not today, Burgel. Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God s sake don t bother me today.
You re just doing your job.
You re detestable.
I know.
Why would you suppose so?
I ve never seen you here before.
No.
I suspected that he well.
That he was satisfied in that regard. I didn t want to pry.
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
Eduard didn t see it as something that needed bearing.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here? This will always be the ghetto.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
The very fact that they re authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests. For all you know he was killed at the hands of the police.
Tonight?
Last year. I it was broken off.
And you...?
I ve hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
What of it?
I have no right to be, I know. My experience with real life is practically nil.
My only concern is the human tribunal. Isn t it yours?
Burgel gave me this what does it mean?
Why were you given notice?
It couldn t be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
You don t believe that.
Now you ve fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
Burgel hated Eduard. And me. I m sure he knew about us and I m sure it drove him mad.
He used to like me very much more than I liked him.
Now you re saying Eduard was lured there?
I ve heard of it happening.
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it s insignificant Burgel. If indeed there was a mistake and a minor one at that you re suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
I knew you walked this way to work. I wanted to find you before they did.
I I found your jailer.
They re dead now. We can get help.
There s a new potion he said it was perfected.
I told you, they re dead. It s finished.
No not this time.
Listen to me
Yes. Yes, of course why wouldn t it be?
Wednesday. We left the office together.
No, we said goodbye outside the building. He went off, as usual, toward his house.
Accident and Compensation Association.
Eight and seven months.
Well other departments are, yes.
Yes. Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we ve been quite good friends. How was Eduard...
I don t know.
No. He didn t seem to be. Do you think he drowned himself?
No, I suppose not.
Can I ask how you found me?
I don t think he really had any. He had no family either.
What makes you think so?
Anyway, I d like you to reflect that in me you have I won t say a friend, because we re complete fencers, of course from distinctly incompatible social classes but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
That s not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
That s been noted. But where does it lead us? Unless you have something more to add.
What did she say?
I can t make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
Just doing our job.
... A piece of paper...
" Accident and Compensation " no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
It usually is.
Why would we keep files on dead employees? All old files are sent up to the Castle. Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it s up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
Orlac is an account?
You must have read about it in the papers there was a terrible cave in. It wouldn t have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain. A great loss.
Is your friend s name among them? Then he only worked on the one case. Your Chief will send me the final summation when he s finished with it.
Of course not. Only by a Director of the firm. Who d want to let in all kinds of riff raff off the streets?
These laws have been with us for centuries how can you doubt them?
You do not summon them they summon you and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
We re a medical firm, aren t we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
You look tired.
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
They d drive us away. That Kafka s made things very hot for us.
It doesn t matter. It s too late for all of us.
Amerika for us!
You re outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
It s... lovely.
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
You calling me a thief? Well, that s great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian the poor guy s happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
How dare you? My father is the British Museum s most respected archeologist!
There s nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It s over.
I don t know what happened to you, Jack... but I can t believe you were always this much of a bastard.
It s ok. I know what you were feeling.
We re leaving.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
I m not sailing with this thing on board!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
Take to look out there.. Have you seen what he s done? You re talking about a crazy animal!
What a climax to the film The first white men to set foot on... " Skull Island " Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a... a... naked stone age tribe!
I m chartering this vessel, Engelhorn how many days?
They re dead.
Yeah, I saw her... she was carried into the jungle by... an animal.
Jack... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It s gonna be good for you and good for me!
That s your monkey, Denham.
What?
Yeah.
Coz of something I lost.
Compassion.
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions something you could help us about.
Please, if he sees you, he won t come!
What about him? Yes.
Oh yes Mr. Klute won t you both join me? And how do you like our fair city? There s so much here don t you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
Oh you ve got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I ve been reading The Fall The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo it s the same thing, you know the imagery
She was with you after she left Frank.
It s good to see you. Well could we do it first and then just talk?
Well well I m just back. And I must tell you something quite wonderful.
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me but a young man can be so silly
Yes?
I d just be guessing.
Maybe this wasn t just a trick. Maybe you re in danger of real love, real involve
Don t belong?
Sorry.
You think people hate you.
Didn t want you.
No.
Look could I use your phone?
Look. I almost killed my I almost killed someone.
Oh well that shouldn t take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
So do I.
Now there s a picture I d like you to
Well we re pretty
We don t want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
I guess he figured it was better.
No, that s not
From the beginning I don t know why the hell he s messin with you. If he was me he d know better. If he was even a city boy he d know better. You re a whore Miss Daniel, that s the truth of it, right? Now somethin I d like you to look at.
Like for you to look for the man.
Yes all right
Yes.
Yes Jane McKenna s book I could make a phone call.
Yes.
If you ll let me go I could tell them what
I m sorry, I m just frightened. Yes.
I said yes, I see.
My name s John Klute.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I ve been hired to look for him.
You know what I m talking about. Miss Daniel.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
Mm.
No, I m look
Could I ask some questions?
Tuscarora
What? What do you remember about that dumper?
But you can t say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don t say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves
Most of them.
How would I remember?
Look, I m sure this ll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
OK
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
OK?
I go on rounds.
What do you think?
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven t.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
No.
It didn t go anywhere. But that s not why
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
You told me what you could. I guess I m through with your part of it.
I don t see anything, do you?
Try some other ways.
And I don t think that was Tom.
No, I said what did you think.
Well
Yeah, you got to me.
Oh. No. Not that way. I d say it was more I don t know too bad? Pathetic?
Not much point to this, is there?
Mm.
Thanks.
Arlyn Page.
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel time.
Arlyn had a very big habit heroin she s the one who started Frank. She s strung out now; you won t find her.
I can make that in a lunch break! Look, Hiram, you re sure it isn t just me? you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you ll hang around for seconds?
What the hell do you think s the matter. I could wait for you someplace.
Then you don t need me.
How?
Why?
What if i go out on tricks you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
I don t get you.
I told you before, you wouldn t understand.
No.
Arlyn was a junkie; I m not on junk!
We did this before.
Mm.
Yeah.
What am I supposed to say?
What?
I was wondering what that was.
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
Right back at the start, right?
Those were police laboratory people, they ve been over the apartment.
With Trina.
Maybe I wasn t there when you called.
How do you know how bad it was?
Oh. Well it wasn t us city people that did it your fine rosy cheeked country boy.
You re going back?
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me.
I am.
About what?
They don t scare me any more.
OK.
It s where it doesn t get me. I ve got nothing left that connects to anything.
I better keep looking.
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
How is it back there?
Well there s a couple
Well as a matter of
Yeah.
Yeah, two things Pete, that
Yeah. It wasn t Tom.
It wasn t Tom that broke in the room.
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn t prove who it was but proves it wasn t Tom.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Someone s been doing all these things.
Pete, I ve got a chance to buy Jane McKenna s black book.
Call girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she ll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I ve been after it a long time.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna s list of clients?
It probably has the Dumper s name. It might give us some kind of new lead. I want a look at it anyhow.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Just send me a money order.
I ve just got a few
Two years ago? Sorry.
She told me.
Why didn t you tell Bree, afterwards?
I d like to talk with Jane McKenna.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
Did she talk about him to you?
Has she talked with you since prison?
I think she s trying that.
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Then how are you involved?
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed? indicates no Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities?
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly am I right Sergeant?
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
Because he knew I couldn t leave the case alone. And this way at least he d keep track of it. And me.
I don t know. It looks familiar to me.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann s disappearance.
What else do you know?
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there s no evidence of murder there s not even a body.
Nobody s seen that.
Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
Yes sir, we know he
Yes?
He s in his room, playing.
Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly. At the moment I am seeing no one.
Not particularly.
The prospect of losing my child.
I see you have people there. What are their names?
What about your mommy?
Lunch in a restaurant.
Playing.
In real life when does he hit you?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Greatest...
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
Wow! French toast, really?
Soon. I told you before, very soon.
No. If I m not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
I m sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and
Billy, don t eat with your fingers.
Mom, I mean dad?
Uh huh...
C mon, there s not much difference
Je sus Christ! I catch all kind of shit at the office because I m not pulling my weight because I m busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and
That s terrific. That s really terrific, but I notice I m the one that s cleaning up this Oh, crap, I ll have to do this one over.
That s okay.
I hate it.
No I didn t. I hate the brown stuff. It s gross.
I m allergic to onions.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
No.
I don t care. I hate it. I want pizza.
You re no bargain either, pal.
Yeah?
Uh huh?
Good night.
Don t let the bedbugs bite.
It s my name too.
Yep.
Uh huh...
No, she never did.
I don t know. I hadn t thought much about it.
Uh, huh?
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Yeah, there was apple juice.
Uh, uh. There was no such a thing as Burger King.
Why does he decide?
Like a principal?
I don t understand, daddy.
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Where will my toys be?
Who will read me my stories?
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I m at mommy s?
Yes, your honor.
I do not, your honor, however
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
Six years.
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
No, I did not.
Yes. I tried to talk to Ted my ex husband about it, but he wouldn t listen. He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn t get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby sitter for Billy.
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Yes. Very much.
Because my son is here. And his father is here. As a mother, I don t want my child to be separated from his father.
Eight, almost nine years.
Yes...
It was good. He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
Yes.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
How many lovers have you had permanently?
I... I don t know...
I suppose...
Yes.
We were married two years before the baby. And then four very difficult years.
Oh? What do you call it then a success? The marriage ended in divorce.
Ted, I m leaving you.
Okay, okay... What is it this time? What did I do now?...
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I m sorry.
Now listen, before you do something you ll really regret you d better stop and think
I m listening, Joanna believe me, I m listening. My wife is walking out on me after eight years of
I heard you, Joanna. I promise I heard you.
What about Billy?
What?
C mon, Joanna, you don t mean that. You re a terrific mother
Okay, I understand and I promise I won t try and stop you, but you can t just go... Look, come inside and talk... Just for a few minutes.
You have?
He is... You sat in that coffee shop across from school
You ve been living here, in the city?
You want what?!
Are you out of your mind?! You re the one that walked out on him, remember?
Joanna, I don t give a
Ted, if you can t discuss this rationally
Yeah, well he did, didn t he.
Ted, do you love him?
Joanna, what the hell is
What?
Oh, God... Oh, my God...
Jim, I ve got to go. I m already late
Me? I ve never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
I m going to be okay. The way I see it, Joanna ll come home, it s just a matter of time.
I don t know, Jim. This whole thing has happened so... Pow like that.
I don t know, Jim...
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs... I think they re kind of interesting.
Well, ah... I thought it over and I decided we re doing it Murray s way.
Yes, what?
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
I can t. I ve got Billy to take care of.
Oh, for God s sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world s most naive human being. Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you ve done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout... Every idea... Every single thing, right down the line.
Kramer, I m sorry. All I was trying to do was
Right.
Kramer
Kramer... There s something I ought to tell you.
I know.... I know.
No. Uh, uh. Tell him I asked for it Friday. I want it Friday. Period.
Fine.
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
I can t tell you how sorry I am.
Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January. That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month. That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child s vacation period. That s it.
We can appeal, but I can t guarantee anything.
It s going to cost.
Six years. Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
Charley, my husband, and I are... divorced and Kim, that s our daughter is about Billy s age and the children play together a lot. So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
But I m going to have to take some stitches.
No.
Look, Ted, all I
Ted, all I wanted to know was where
OhmyGod. Didn t she say anything? She must ve said something.
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and... well, she told me a lot of... ah, things about the two of you.
I mean... things. Ted, Joanna s very unhappy and
What d you know about how Joanna felt? You went off to an office every morning and you d come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
Oh for shit s sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met. No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
Maybe she didn t feel like she should have to. Maybe she felt like if you d been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would ve noticed.
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You ve got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay. But I ll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
I don t know, Thel... This whole thing has happened so... Pow, like that.
I m gonna keep him, why?
Thelma, I ve lost my wife, I m not losing my child.
Got it.
I understand.
Lenox Hill. 77th Street between Park and Lex. The emergency number is 327 0800.
No, not really... I guess it s different if you don t have children, but... I dunno, even if Charley and I don t live together, even if we re sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again... He d still be my husband. That stuff about " Till death do you part? " That s really true.
Three. And add some basil.
No. I don t think so.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Uh, huh... Yeah...
Sure.
What?
Don t say that! I don t want to hear you say that!
Me?! You want me to take care of Billy?!
Uh, huh...
Ted, I just heard...
Again?
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, " His time has come. "
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
I miss my brother.
How many?
Good day.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
We won t let him get hurt, Ma am.
My department doesn t have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
Oh, but you have, Ma am. You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice. A man s been killed in part cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I m sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
You re to wait right here until the police show, you re under full house arrest.
Thank you.
It happens when I land.
' Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
No. If you don t kill him instantly, I m dead and you ll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry. And even if you were on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
I ll need any and all topographic studies.
Mr. Cyr!
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it s only a matter of time.
Well, you ve got a croc alright, they re keystone species.
Cocktail?
They come on land and they re brazen. They re also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
And you like me.
What the hell are you doing?!!
You re crawling around like a
A spring trap!
I coulda shot you, you
They don t really attack underwater and
Yup.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
He didn t eat the kid cause he d just swallowed a bear.
I m tired, Hector. I know this because you re beginning to not bug me.
Then do it!!
I just have this feeling everything s totally safe.
Get your big gun and guard the shore. Hector. Go to your tent.
Bastard bit my chopper.
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out. And I think I know a way to
Right.
You ready on shore?
Thirty meters or so. Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Radar, he s underwater. But he s definitely coming.
Thank you, Jack.
You talk to Bickerman?
Women s intuition. Are there anymore?
I never had sex with you!
' Cept he wasn t before, was he? You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You re fat.
And what if I tranq him Kelly? He drowns. You think about that?
What? Oh as if I m interested.
Are you sure?
You think I m that nuts?
Nothing s real.
I m no psychiatrist. But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than
No.
Can I tell them you won t go back in the water?
They could try to tranq him on land.
Guess I finally got bit.
Yeah. Thanks to you.
Jack Wells. A museum sent you?
Big but... a bear couldn t do that to a moose or man in water. On land maybe. But...
Never been to Maine before?
I told you.
How would you know, what
So I don t like tents, why
Well. You don t have to stay out here, why don t
What?
Who?
Something s in that water.
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there s one out there...
I beg your pardon?
I am not staying on shore.
I didn t fly up here to roast marshmallows
Good.
Good. See ya soon.
Yeah. Nobody saw anything?
That s probably good.
Excuse me?
What are you talking about?
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack. I m all moist.
Nice? Nice would be " you look pretty, " nice is not some man eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
You did, you
A man just died, you re hitting on me with science.
Yeah. I got some stuff for your cut.
I wonder if he s some kind of mutant. That bear had to be surprised.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Father s a surgeon. I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn t be a bad idea here.
Keep it dry. No swimming.
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
Ssssh!
Maybe. Don t mush it.
You re mushing it a little around the
That is it!!
No. I keep getting hit with heads!
You calm down!
Alright, Jack!
Okay.
Well...
He has been going after everything. It could work. But this is not a happy cow.
He s floating. Take it home.
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven t found somebody in my world. You found anyone in yours?
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in my world who was good for you and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
Worth a try. We don t wanna be alone forever, do we?
You gonna dig up that lady s husband?
White perch.
Doesn t look like it.
We shouldn t even really be doing this.
I ll take it!
Did he say anything?
And you didn t see anything?
There? That s the morgue.
Is the dead guy in there?
I m fine, thank you.
Well. At wakes.
Seconds. Three, four.
Yes.
You talk to the married couple?
What kind of backup do we have?
Sorry. I m just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
I got nothing against
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit. Whatever s out there, one shot with this and he s dead.
Was he swallowed?
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
We re staying in tents?
Yes, camp, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard " tents ", will there be toilets?
I thought I saw...
You threw it at me!!
It s to make you understand him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don t put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
And that s why he thinks they re Godly?
You like Jack?
Hector thinks you like him.
You think Jack s handsome?
I m just curious. I can never tell what women think is handsome. Is he handsome?
What?
Such a simple idea and it s working. What does that tell you?
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it s a dangerous mix.
The somebody else part?
A jerk.
It s ten after nine.
Kevin. How s it going, what s happenin, family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
A tooth?
Oh, well then I m sure that s it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
I m sure it s nothing, but you re a paleontologist, this is what we do, I
I d like you to check out this lake. See
Kelly
Part of our research
It has nothing to do with
Kelly
I tapped you.
Wild guess.
Kevin told me you were upset.
It started before you, Kelly, I never would ve
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Kelly
Backstabber?
Liar?
Shitbutt?
Never cock. Just squeeze.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
Why not?
The worst part the thing that s making me crazy is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can t see him... Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
Not random at all, maybe. Like there s some pattern here...?
Well, except for the one girl.
' Cause she didn t drift. He weighted her down.
Hot damn, Clarice.
Where?
Sometimes.
I will... I promise.
Safe, SHIT, he s got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
Get me out!
I don t know! Get me out!!
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don t you LEAVE ME down here, DON T YOU YOU
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It s not a charm school.
I understand.
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
Dr. Chilton, I told you this is just routine follow up on the Raspail case.
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Starling
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
That wasn t me.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Jack Gordon.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
I hope so. They haven t posted anything.
Not yet.
Who s the subject?
Yes sir.
It s all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Right down to the kleenex I used. Sir, why? Is something wrong?
Sir, that s a field job. It s outside the scope of my assignment. And I ve got a test tomorrow on
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir
Sir, what is it? There s something you re not telling me.
Murdered...? How?
I m here, sir, I just I don t know how to feel about it.
There s no correlation at all between where they re kidnapped and where they re found...? What if what if you trace the heaviest traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
He s a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he s not a drifter he s got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
What he does with them takes privacy... Time, tools... He s in his 30 s or 40 s he s got real physical strength, but combined with an older man s self control. He s cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won t end in suicide, like they often do.
He s got a real taste for it now. And he s getting better at his work.
You haven t said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren t up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
I m wondering if he s done that before placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
Then have the lab check Raspail s head. Dr. Lecter s patient have them probe his soft palette tissues... They ll find another cocoon.
He s already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards asked him for Bill?
But if he knew we have so little time
I think he means it, this time. I think he ll deal.
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
You ll back me up with some paperwork? Then I ll try. But wouldn t this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
I m 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I d still have to retire in two years. It s not a consideration. But you are... You ve done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you ll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that s about it. Now s your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might ve stalked her. I m going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio. Now s the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don t let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We ve got less than 30 hours.
You heard them. I don t have that authority anymore.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You ve got to send me!
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
Starling
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We re on our way now.
Sewing...
Chicago s only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in
Starling you ve earned back your place in the Academy. We never would ve found him without you, and nobody s ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they d have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant? Do you think she could ve had a friend you didn t know about?
Did you ever work with her?
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I d like to talk to her.
I think so.
Sometimes you do.
I m the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now? Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
We leave in the morning?!
Can we rest soon?
Let us go, miss.
Anyone lookin to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
Yes. He said... " do not try to make them understand you. "
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
I m sorry.
How did you learn English?
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn t bother with?
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison. Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
Sorry to disappoint you...
Because what I am interested in is right here...
No. I will find you.
Maybe...
When? How?
There was none!
There was no letter.
" Justice "? If that s " justice "..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
And by sea!
Isn t respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
" Some "?
We were headed...
Day and a half Where did you get... the guide?
He is Huron and nothing else. Why would he want to murder the girl?
Dark haired...
No blood vengeance? No re proach or insult?
Came across the war party, tracked em.
No.
No. Headin west. To Can tuck ee.
Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
Ottawa!
That is sedition! Treason!
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
We don t.
This is it, as far as we can go... If we re lucky, they ll be figurin we can t have come this way and must ve beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we re very lucky, they ll figure we went over the falls.
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it s 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
A French  Indian army out of Fort Carillon s heading south to war against the English. I m here to raise this county s militia to aid the British defense.
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
And what is that?
I know. One has to give Americans " reasons " and make agreements to get them to do anything at all. Tiring, isn t it? But that s the way of it here.
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro s daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.... eighteen killed. It s these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I ve seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
Webb s at Edward?
General Webb can burn in hell. We ll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
I understand. This is not good place to stop. Two leagues from here. No water til then. That where we stop. Better place.
" Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women. When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness. "
Gifts?
Wampum?
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
For Munro children?
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
Chingachgook s of the same opinion. Taken together, that s gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials presence.
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man s word!
This interview s over! The militia stays!
Yes.
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
Magua slept hard in the English wigwams. And the sticks left their mark... Magua s village and lodges were burnt. Magua s children were killed by the English. Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua s wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this. In time Magua became blood brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron. And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
My master requires the fort be destroyed. But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They re free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
Granted.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
France.
La victoire.
Well, I ll be on the golf course in the morning. Then, if I don t have any babies to deliver
These observers were doing something. A test... I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
He did.
I m not a doctor.
I don t know. I ve been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
And they didn t believe the symptoms I described...
It could be a million things, something in the air, food.... But he went on that ship and so did Williams... I want to examine the crew.
No. I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
Danakil man?... one of our ancestors. Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
But what about those scales... or that leech like thing that bit Cobb?
He don t need a readout, man, he needs help!
Uh, oh... I see where this is going...
What has?
Can you fix it?
Think! Can we stop it?! Block it up?! Shut down the line somewhere?! Think!
No!
Shit...
How do you know it was Williams?
What?
There probably wasn t anything wrong with his suit...
Why? You going to give me hard time like the others?
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps... Why are you here?
Yeah... I think they re just deciding what to do with us.
How much time does that give us?
Where s Doc?!
Uh.. Excuse me sir, it s the air recirculating system, sir...
... I d really have to show it to you.
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
Okay.
And it killed Bo?
I know that.
What you don t understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
I m not anxious to find out, either.
Do it.
It shouldn t be a long delay.
Not yet.
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
It... almost got you.
Itches like hell.
I ain t doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
Who cares?
What game, Cobb?... I m on my way to Nirvana...
The infirmary?...
What are you going to do to him?
No fuckin lie...
Sixpack...
How many times I got to tell you. I saw a ship.
Tip top, Willie... tip top.
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Your pocket?
Hardly.
Probably no longer than four weeks.
Well, talk.
I would rather put my money on a three legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON... it won t win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
It s hit us all hard!
Apart from those shotguns.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
You want a pint, go to the pub.
It s a Samoan pub.
Like antiques.
You get the guns?
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
There were two old guns there; where are they?
They were...
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Yeah, Bazza, what?
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot... don t worry, I got it under control.
Oh, you must be the brains then. That s right, guns that fire shot... Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that s all I want. I ll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it s yours.
You re doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
Chris. You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
Can I help?
Yes?
Yeah, it s all there, to the pound.
It looks like  t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Very fucking funny. Where s what I want?
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That s if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop fuckin chop.
Well, it s a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
That s no way to answer the phone.
Sure is.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need em back.
I got the money to pay for em.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don t even know who lives in there.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with em.
Er well, yes we do.
The stupid bastards! Count it!
We re not going next door until we ve flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don t want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
Is there no way they can get back to you?
No.
There is only three of us here.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Out the back.
Invitations?
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Samoan Jo s? Yon mean the pub? Hold on...
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster!... What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
You think it s a good idea taking it back to yours?
What do you mean?
Why, what s up?
Right as rain.
... What?
I 11 meet you in the car.
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn t know your father.
You will what?
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don t have to turn them over because you can borrow.
For half a million?
It s Ed, if that s what you mean.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I like your bar.
I want your bar.
Do you want me to draw a picture?
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son s life.
All right, it s Plank. Is Willie there?
Well, perhaps you can help?
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
I think you ll find it is in your interest.
I didn t know you were a kebab man, Plank.
I know. Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
You know how much it is, Nick.
Doesn t sound very good to me.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn off shotguns.
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I d shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
Range? I don t want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don t want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
All right, let s forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
Cupid stupid! That s the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher s, not a grocer s.
That s going on optimism.
Tom, you re all heart.
It s the mother of fuck ups, stupid!
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
Six.
Twelve.
Er, well, twelve.
How the fuck should I know?
That s fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it s all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
Er, fertilizer.
We need fertilizer, Winston.
What do you mean?
I don t pretend I came over on the Mayflower
So?
Oh, come on, Amado
Leave your sister out of it.
I can t take any more school.
So?
They re not going to jail.
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don t even live here all year.
They stole our land
I can fix cars.
You think I can t learn that?
I m not settling for anything. I like cars, it s just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it s a waste.
Oh, come on you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
No, sir
I m sorry, sir.
Yes, sir
I I can do the job, sir.
I am, sir.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
The the officers.
You really want to know, sir?
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
I do, sir.
Outside it s it s such a mess it s
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
No, sir. Not at all.
Yes, sir.
He s going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
If I had I wouldn t have gone in.
Sergeant?
I m feeling okay
You re testing me?
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals had a shooting the other night at Big O s Soldier got ventilated.
September 97, that s all she wrote.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
We find a body, it s either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five foot eleven, chewed tobacco then we get into the dental records
That badge
Yeah.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left not much to go on.
Colt Peacemaker.
He swore by it. What?
So is Buddy on your short list?
You got to investigate. No question about it.
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of em relatives. People breed like chickens.
There s gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon
You re fired. You re outta the department.
You little pissant
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3. 4, soft hands, lateral movement the whole package. Only a sophomore
Well, Daddy s got his box at the stadium, of course, and I ll fly to the Cowboy away games when they re in the Conference. Then there s the high school on Friday nights. West Side got a boy 6 6 ", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we re talkin. Guess how much he can bench press?
Do I seem jumpy?
Last year was awful rough Mama passing on and the whole business with O. J. I mean it s not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop
And that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal
They hadn t pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
Daddy calls it an " altercation. " How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says " Even my son in law was better than this pinhead I got now ".
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always " high strung. " " My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn t so high strung. " Or " tightly wound, " that was another one. You seeing anyone?
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds em up. You aren t talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
You watch the draft this year? Course you didn t, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there s some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor s reports, highlight reels, coaches evaluations, psychological profiles hell, I wouldn t be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don t amount to diddly, does it?
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn t you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn t know I was tightly wound
What?
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
You look good, Bunny. It s nice to see you.
Colonel. Is uhm is Otis in?
If it s too late
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
Your mother got a brother Alphonse
Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
Yeah, I know Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he d marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and all?
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
No sir.
He a Black man or an Indian?
The Trail of Tears.
So they stayed in Florida?
They fought against the Indians?
But they were Indians themselves.
You know who I am?
That guy who got shot
Are you kidding? And face a court martial?
No sports if I don t keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA s
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it s like he s got to tighten the screws a little more
I mean, just cause he didn t you know
He s still pissed off about it.
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras couple of em won the whatsit Congressional Medal Of Honor
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough
I finished that. I m just messing around.
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
You wouldn t?
Fine. I m pretty much moved in.
My father.
You own this place?
You lived in the States for a while?
Made some money, came back here
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question s just been where to draw it
It s a lead mine.
I don t know why I m talking to you, you ve got that thing on your head.
It s not just cactus. There s the nopals, the yuccas
Man knows a hundred fifty varieties of beer, he can t tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore
I think it s beyond what you d call dating.
Maybe.
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn t married must be a lesbian. She figures they ll be so relieved I m a man
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn t tell me the ninja assassin part
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains
If I stayed out past ten with the guys she d go into her Madame Butterfly routine
What it s a bullet. I m lousy with bullets here.
Yeah?
They were using M 1 s, yeah
Hey she s in a tough situation. I cut her some slack
Well I don t see what s changed. No PDA s, no necking on the obstacle course.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
We should just do it.
You could take it
I d quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn t Army land anymore, it s your jurisdiction.
That ring
Pleased to meet you.
If the next guy s a redneck.
Good deal you were born down here, then.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
But just as a kind of safety tip.
Substance abuse?
That s where he fell.
It s a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out
So tell me why I shouldn t make this place off limits.
We have an enlisted man s club at the post.
That s right.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
I hear things, too. People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
And people make their choice
Why would you want to do that?
No hay de que. Tengo otra.  No problem, I ve got another. 
I heard somebody been haulin wets on this road.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don t have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it he can run his own operation thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Protection?
Si tengo escopeto just a shotgun
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car
Quien es?  Who is it? 
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave  There s been a bad accident 
I have some friends who have had a accident
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin for help, and I look and she has falling in the water
You think you re doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals
Es mi novia.  She s my girlfriend. 
I am marry to the cousin of a friend but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child
We have a daughter.
Donde vamos?  Where are we going? 
Senora, anything it costs, I can work
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
King wasn t Mexican, Fenton
' 57, 1 believe
Seems like we have another one every week.
We don t need a new jail.
Santiago.
Right.
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
You go by your old house?
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God awful color
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
I told the story enough times hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe s
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O
No. I think his widow s still in their place in Darktown, though. You think it s Charley Wade, huh?
There s no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin up old business.
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
We have a murder?
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can t.
Do you?
Hey, Sam.
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met
Buddy Deeds
And the ten thousand?
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy s Town in Cuidad Leon
The Perdido thing?
Steve?
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
All my mother does is work. That s how you get to be Spanish.
The Sheriff.
I m unmarried. I m not available.
Maybe you re just getting less patient.
Well, you hire illegals
If you spent a little more time training them
No. I was wondering if you d like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up
Oh, come on you must be curious how it s changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I ve never been further than Ciudad Leon
He was killed.
A little older than Paloma is now.
I was too busy.
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
I don t mean Fernando.
I never said that.
I felt that you could do better for yourself
I never said that. It was just that boy
That s me.
Sheriff Deeds dead, honey you just Sheriff junior.
You ever play one of these?
Well, don t ever start up on em, cause once you do you can t stop. I tell myself I m gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
I won t say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
We run that twenty odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
Not if I can help it.
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn t deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin for.
Wasn t legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, " Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership. " But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote we was called colored back then, if you was polite maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin.
Okay? He s not here?
I d like to see them spend a day pulling 14 year olds off of each other I should get combat pay
That was the night he disappeared?
And when my father was Sheriff?
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
Of course you can.
Yeah?
It s Saturday.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
Enough with the clothes
I only went for my last two years.
Hey, Pete. How s it going?
How much you got left?
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you d see a lot more daylight.
You re going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
I thought he busted you a couple times.
I m surprised he bothered with it.
So I ve heard
Well, you were working there
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies who s gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
They ve got my Amado.
Somebody called something about an electronics store.
We haven t talked since high school.
Lunch hour. My next class isn t till nine thirty.
I can t name anybody she does like these days.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
Most people did, yeah.
Yeah.
Amado.
He hates me.
With Paloma, it s more like she pities and tolerates me totally age appropriate. But Amado he s he s never been book smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment like a betrayal.
Fernando wasn t pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
Got divorced, I wasn t gonna work for my father in law anymore. The fellas down here said they d back me
I got to admit it s not what I thought it d be. Back When Buddy had it hell, I m just a jailer. Run a 60 room hotel with bars on the windows.
You ve got your mother, your kids
Pilar
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
Yeah.
I don t know. It just feels good. Always did.
Two years.
Don t have kids. Other pictures I don t know it s nothing I want to look back on.
Pilar
What was your father s name?
She ll figure it out sooner or later. I don t have to ask permission anymore, if that s what you mean.
Couple months before I was born
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you " our beautiful daughter " in the letters she wrote to him.
Yeah
The shooter local?
Okay we ll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Yeah.
I been working on a few things.
I m going over to the other side.
No to Mexico. I ve got to talk to somebody.
Gotta be in person.
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
You d do a good job.
Don t know if I ll still want it.
You don t need to cuff me.
Just doing my job.
This isn t Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
That the problem, son? You Slow?
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
This is a club, Sheriff you been in here
What s up?
I haven t seen anybody come by.
Yeah. It s quiet
Sure.
You sell much out here?
Hell of a spot to put a business.
So when did Buddy leave?
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
No
Another woman?
You know who it was?
You haven t paid the cab. He won t give us your bags til you pay him.
Thirty five bucks.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D Amour.
They go together.
Who?
Nix?
Who is he?
How?
You heard right.
Yeah. She was killed in a car crash. Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
My life was too weird for her.
I mean, there s no instructions What do you mean, they re not tricks?
Trickery and divinity. Yeah, he says that all the time.
Did your husband know Quaid?
You don t?
I don t exactly know. Philip doesn t like to talk about the past.
And you don t ask questions?
Does that mean...?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
No. You re right. He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more. But people get lost. Even good people. Too much fame. Too much money,
Harry.
I m no bodyguard.
When do you want me to start?
I heard what happened. It looks like somebody murdered him.
I don t know where you d start.
They won t tell you anything.
Yes. I think you probably can. We d need to talk about your fee.
Why? Because he had you?
That s my business. Harry.
Yes... I m here. And no. I don t know the name.
It doesn t ring a bell. I have to go.
It was more than that, I think.
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
He could get into people s heads. Make them see things. Terrible things. And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
I told you
No.
I wasn t.
I was grateful to him. I owed him my life. And he loved me. He couldn t always show it, but he felt it.
No it isn t. You can t help me.
Nothing?
Don t be. Nix can t hurt you now.
I m sure. He s dead.
And they all came...
Quaid and Jennifer
You can t.
I m here, Harry.
Harry?
Good. There. Yes?
Harm to whom? Me? I don t think, so. Try him again at the hotel.
The usual. Full house. Standing ovation. I tell them it s magic...
Yeah. Remember Quaid?
Somebody killed him.
Sure. You want me to find out about Quaid? I mean, the funeral?
I m a private detective. I was hired to follow somebody for a few days. A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
Tapert s got nothing to do with this. He came here to get his palm read.
I got a file on him two inches thick. He s a petty fraudster. This is something else. Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
He got up and walked.
Vanished.
For now. Are you planning to go back to New York?
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
So could you walk on water?
I heard he was the best.
Oh, I ve got plenty.
Just tell me about Swann. Or are you too scared?
Mr. D Amour?
It s one in the afternoon.
We ve never met.
I m here to offer you a job.
Mine.
Maybe I just bought it.
You could almost pass for a detective, D Amour. I work for the best illusionist in the world.
You know of him?
Are you a gambling man?
Never call him that. He s strictly an illusionist.
Probably.
I don t think the dead much care.
Looking for you. I tried the hotel.
You re a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I m going to keep this brief. Here s thirty thousand dollars.
A ticket home,
She doesn t want to see you. She s had enough pain. Enough churning over the past. She wants it all left alone.
Yes. It s regrettable
What for? You need to stay busy?
Why people die? Give it up, D Amour. Go home.
I m afraid she s not in.
Yeah, I know.
Yes.
Yes.
I tried to pay you off.
No. It was mine. I didn t want any more bloodshed. That s why we went to all this trouble, so there d be no one for Nix to come after.
Shit...
We ve got to get you to a hospital.
Shut up. We ve lost enough lives already.
What about?
A Mister Quaid?
What s her problem?
Does anybody?
What?
Yeah. You could say that.
Not much.
I m not afraid to die. There s something terrible... coming home...
Yes...
What?
At birth. I don t know you
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don t know you.
What a tragedy. It was just a matter of time, of course, but it s not good for the business.
You don t know the half of it. I m Walter Wilder, by the way.
Sure. Vivovich.
I d love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
For what?
Have you been in?
You shouldn t have followed me, D Amour.
Now I m going to have to kill you.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D Amour. Magicians get burned.
He deserved it.
I did it for Dorothea.
It s me betrayed him.
I don t know what else to do.
Didn t know you read minds.
Is that all?
And he didn t have them?
Is that all?
And you believed him?
No.
Yes.
He s better off this way.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
You didn t try hard enough.
Yes?
I don t know.
No. I m taking a couple of weeks vacation.
I got to go. I m late.
There s other guys as good as me, Loomis.
A couple of weeks.
What?
No.
Well, you didn t forget me. I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
What about Philip Swann?
He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn t know anything. He made us think it was over and done with.
I don t want to think about it. If I think about it he ll hear me. He ll find me.
Is he the Puritan?
And he s dead?
Fuck you.
Why would I want to?
Not true.
Yes.
No!
We re looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it s a really big deal, he s the Johnny Carson of Japan.
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
Ok, you re scheduled to leave Saturday, but we ll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you re waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
Bob, it s me.
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
You ll do it?
My husband s here for work he s a photographer and I just came along... I m not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
Two years.
You re probably just having a mid life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
25 years... that s a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
Oh.
I m not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
Philosophy.
I don t know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Thanks. I m sure your mid life crisis will work out, too.
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
No, how about you?
I m here for the week.
Ok.
It s Charlotte.
I think he kind of liked me... Is that so hard to imagine?
How d a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
No, you smiled.
I don t know. My fax said " have a good fright ".
Ok, whatever you want.
No, I was looking at you.
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
You re possessive.
No, yes, it does...
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don t care about things the same way...
You ll figure it out. I m not worried about you. Keep writing.
That s ok.
It s hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
We established that we have no communication.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she s tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn t need me, and they don t need me, I feel like I m in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
When they re born its like Vietnam. It s terrifying.
But, it s great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
Where d you grow up?
John thinks I m so snotty.
How old is she?
We should get you to the doctor.
Working.
Yeah.
Tomorrow.
That s what you said the other night.
I know. But, it doesn t last, you have to go back sometime.
Hi, Bob.
Uh, yeah... I ll bring it down.
Yes.
Thanks.
Yes?
Oh?
Yes?
I don t think so.
Yes?
Hello, darling.
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
Well, that s good, I have to get the kids off for school. Can I call you in a little while?
Ok, well... I love you.
Bob?
Is this a bad time?
It s really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
It s just carpet.
What are you talking about?
Is there anything I can do?
What?
Alright?
Fine.
Why don t you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
I have to go, Adam s tormenting Zoe, I ll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Hello, Bob, it s me.
It s Lydia, your wife.
Fine. Is it going ok?
Do you want to
Do you want to talk to Zoe?
That s ok.
Tomorrow.
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
Do you want I send it to your room?
Excuse me?
Hello, can I have room 5601.
What?
Why do you have to defend her?
Ok. Maybe I ll walk down with you.
Sure.
I went to a temple today and I didn t feel anything.
But I like to... and I don t smoke that much.
Oh... that s nothing, someone gave it to me.
I m not. It s just corny, but I m not into it.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let s have some.
Charlotte?! How s Tokyo?
Ok, have fun there, you re so lucky you don t have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
I m just here shooting this band, what about you?
We re here for the week. I m shooting in Osaka for a few days.
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
Bad?
I must really be slacking off. Hungry?
Hmmm.
Sorry. It s just... a strange woman waltzes into my office today. Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Forgot my car keys. What are you doing on the fourth floor?
I can t believe Will killed him.
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
Claire...
I don t know. What are they?
Must be a spare set.
You really had me going, Claire. I was finally ready to propose to you.
My secretary?
No, I wasn t, actually.
You know I m not comfortable with this.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
I m aware of that, but I don t think he s in any condition to make requests. I m trying to appeal to your more... logical self, Father. I m concerned about harm to my patient.
I certainly hope you re not lending any credence to this.
And was he in distress when you opened the door? Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
Father, I m right here.
Don t worry... about the transformation, Maya.
Um hm. That s right, Maya.
Peter Kelson?
I saw you on television yesterday. You were brilliant.
Not pure evil. That s correct.
Listen, I m sorry, but I m running late.
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
Do you remember Henry Birdson? The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed. You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed. Disastrously. Which means there s still a demonic spirit present in his body. I was wondering, perhaps you d like to go meet Henry. He s pretty amazing.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself. If you re really that confident, you d be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
I think you gave me the wrong one.
I had to.
That s their explanation. You might not believe me...
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man. You are that man, Peter.
It s true. Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code. It wasn t easy but I figured it out. It spelled your name.
If you re possessed, you can t reveal anything Satan wants hidden. Unless you trick him.
The good outwitting the bad. It s like Birdson had a split personality.
You re already contaminated. It s why you couldn t hear the tape. There s probably a pentacle near your bed. To sanctify you.
I know this sounds crazy. I understand. Check your parents blood types. Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
There s no reason why you should. This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of. Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
You were not baptized. At least I don t believe it was Christian. Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
Seven years. One baptism? He s your mother s only brother
I looked at the coroner s report. My father s O positive and my mother... A negative.
So... then the coroner s report is probably wrong. I mean... this is ridiculous. There s been a mistake. I don t believe any of this.
And if what you re saying is true, what would happen to me?
When s your birthday?
What s the bible for?
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these... visions.
We re going to do this.
I know it is. Right after my parents died, I went to the beach... I was in the water. Everything was calm. And then one of those really big waves hit me. Hard. Pulled me straight to the bottom. I struggled and finally ran out of air. If it hadn t been for my sister who pulled me out, I would ve drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
Maybe that s my problem.
Until it happens, you re still a human being.
What are these?
Maybe I should check Lareaux s book. It s in the car. Be right back. Don t go anywhere.
So, what does it mean. The ark sank and the sun set?
What did he say to you in French?
I know who he is.
I ve filed a report with Father Frank.
We need all the help we can get.
We ll see Father Frank in the morning. There s nothing to be done until then.
You can t back out on me now. We need to be sure.
Look, John, I m facing it.
Nothing you couldn t find out from reading the papers. And you re already wrong on one count.
Get out of here.
What about that psychic, what s his name, Szabo?
I think it s gonna be a waste of time.
I ll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
Thanks for having me, Sally.
Well, long term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
No, the less mystifying. Good and evil are only illusions. There is no such thing as evil with a capital " E. " That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
There weren t any voices.
As if there s another cause for little voices? No, Sally, Viznick s a manipulator, he s clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self obsessed.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He s simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Right. If you believe in God. As a narcissist, Viznick couldn t blame himself for the alleged murders. He created the voices after the fact. In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Mike. Oh, the christening. I meant to call...
Really? You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
Yeah, look at that sweet face. You d never guess he killed nine people. I m gonna get my smokes. Be right back.
How re you doin today?
She s got a juvenile record from New Orleans. Parents died when she was 13.
Yeah, murder suicide.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself. Crime of passion.
Where is she now?
Nothing.
Fine, you don t like this one, which one would you rather wear?
I don t know why I keep hoping you ll grow out of this tomboy thing.
Well, that s what you think, isn t it? Cause I d rather wear a jersey than an apron...
I can t eat before a game.
Didn t know I needed a reason to come home.
Dad around?
Need any help?
How is he?
To that stewardess?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
Find out where they re registered and send them a gift.
You didn t want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
Don t curse.
You re the one always turning your nose up at me.
Child, please. Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
Oh, yes. The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
I don t remember that.
That s ridiculous.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff. It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
She s alright.
The blue.
Are you okay?
He s fine.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
You re a caterer?
Sort of.
Huh?
Uh huh.
Don t go starting rumors, Jim. My son s college bound with or without basketball.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
It s okay.
Kyra, this is Monica. She, uh...
What?
Why not?
Baby, don t talk like that. Your rehab s going well. You ll be back before you know it.
To do what you love.
You re just scared. I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you ll be as good as you were but you will be. I believe in you. You just have to get back on the court. Like you d get back on a horse.
No.
Always on my ass, anyway.
No one s forcing her.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
Found? I m not some charity case.
Mom tell you to do this?
Damn, Lena... Who is he?
He s in college?
How d you get him to say yes?
Oh, great.
Yeah, right.
Too many times.
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
You lost your head.
What?
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
Dad. What are you doing here?
That tends to happen when you re the boss s daughter.
Hey, don t take it personal. And don t think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other. We re teammates, okay?
I was just playing ball.
Just wanted to say good game.
No buts. Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
Just one word of advice for next season.
What s up, Sidra.
Just like that?
How s that been?
I wouldn t know.
Just not my type, I guess.
It s this big hole. You could almost see bone.
I just can.
My Mom says she doesn t know where I come from cause I act different.
He works at a bank.
I m going to be number thirty two, like Magic.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
One time Magic scored forty eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
I don t care.
I d just tell my sister, Lena.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together. And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
Oh.
Kay.
For how long?
My Dad always drives my Mom.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
I know this. What do you want?
Your legs don t look broke.
Guess " please " would be a stretch.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
She s a ho cause she s sending her coochie through the mail.
And? She s not saying, " I think you re a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better, " she s saying, " I wanna bone. "
Yeah, an honest tramp ass ho. But I guess you ll stick your dick in anything.
I don t.
Who said I m not getting recruited?
God, here we go.
Would you watch the damn road?
I m warning you, don t tempt me.
With a jacked up attitude.
I don t.
Yeah.
Hey.
Yeah.
He ain t Spalding.
Figures.
None of your business.
What?
It was on my bed when I came in. Can you just...?
Yeah.
Basically broke down how I m gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
You do see me standing here, right?
Fine, Quincy.
I m telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
I don t have it easy like you, alright. There s no red carpet laid out for me.
What are we playing for?
I know he messed up, but that doesn t change what he s been to you.
She understands.
You re not stupid.
I m not up for running into anybody. Let s just kick it here, alright?
Why not?
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
Quincy...
What s up?
Nobody.
Look, this party s whack. You ready to go?
Fine... Maybe I ll come by later.
Hey, what s up.
The " man " again.
What the hell s going on?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
Cheap date.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
What, " Q man ", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew. What was I supposed to do?
If I stayed, I wouldn t be starting!
I never asked you to choose.
I m a ballplayer. If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
I m going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
I don t think so.
Look, I m entering the draft.
Few days ago.
No, it looks good. I mean, it s cool.
I m alright. But you can sit.
Yup.
A lot of things. All I know is I ll be back in six months.
Not for Quincy McCall.
We won the championship.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
Oh yeah?
Must have been my cheap ass answering machine. It was always messing up.
What do you mean?
A rest?
Kyra s gone for a couple days. Figured I d keep Mom company.
Darryl. He s alright, kinda corny.
Getting there.
Yeah. Two weeks. I didn t get to send you an invitation, but if you...
Because I m kinda feeling that way, too.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Nah. I haven t dribbled a ball in four and a half months. Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops... or trying to be better than him. Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
Maybe go back to school.
It s a trip, you know? When you re a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it s not gonna turn out that way.
Why do you keep asking me that?
Something was just missing.
What?
You woke me up to tell me that?
What I m trying to say is, I ve loved you since I was eleven and the shit won t go away.
Then why are you so upset?
Better late than never, right?
What?
For what?
So you re gonna bitch up?
I know why you broke up with me in college. And not that what you did wasn t messed up, but what I did was, too. So if you forgive me, I ll forgive you.
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
So, if I win it s because deep down you know you re about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
Hey.
C mon, girl, you live next door. Who s been creeping?
Just you and Quincy, baby. I got a meeting.
Business folks.
At one in the morning?
I m just saying it d be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy. If you don t talk to him...
What s that, not great?
Nona, please.
We still have to go?
Uh, your earring?
We were just studying.
Okay.
Twenty seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Said he d be home later.
Sorry. You okay?
Don t sweat it, okay. Sooner or later the truth ll come out.
This is just about money, you know that.
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho s?
" Can t " should never be in a man s vocabulary.
Cause when you say can t, you ain t a man.
I don t care about the team. I care about the school.
I don t wanna hurt your feelings.
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I m gonna be late.
You know, people.
I m also good enough to go pro.
You came out early.
What mess?
What?
Tell me what?
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer s telling me to settle.
A case like this could hang around for months and I m up for this player relations job with the " Clips. " This gets out, false or not, no one ll touch me.
Your door was unlocked.
We need to talk.
I messed up, okay, I know that. But I ain t that kid s father.
Look, I ain t saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
Boy, you re so perfect you can look down on me?
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn t she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don t get me wrong, you re the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn t ready for no marriage.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can t let you do this.
Came by to check on you.
Don t remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
I can see that. I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can t get down on yourself.
No.
Quincy. I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
You want me to fuck off?
I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
I can t believe you re gonna do this to me, the situation I m in, I don t Avi: You know what? Being hit by lighting doesn t matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don t do this.
THAT S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.

And the book says: " We may by through with the past, but the past ain t through with us. "
No, no, no. I m fine. It s small, I wanna keep going

It is. Can I have your home phone number with area code?
I m really only equipped to take orders
Well what s the situation?
I m here, I m listening.
I know and I can t really explain that, but I have a feeling there s something, some situation between them, like they don t really know each other much or well, something like they don t talk much anymore
Does this sound weird?
There s no number for Frank in any of Earl s stuff and he s pretty out of it I mean, like I said, he s dying, y know. Dying of Cancer.
Brain and Lung.
It s rough. I m sorry, did she make it?

It s upstairs.

Cynthia?
How much time do we have?
I should maybe go to the bathroom.
I don t know.
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can t go to the bathroom now. You have exactly one minute before we re back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
Richard.
Did we win or lose, I mean?
Stay quiet... stay quiet, son
No, Son... be quiet... be quiet now...

He s doing the interview with the lady
What happend?
Doc, just don t, how close are you?
This sounds threatening.
I have love all over. I even have love for you, friend.
Well
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m boy, but I believe it s that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
A very chatty kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
And I m listening avidly, fellow.
You re a friend of the family I presume?
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
What?
I used to be smart but now I m just stupid.
" The " cause of dullness in others
Yes they do, they do, but I ll make my dreams come true, you see? I will.
I used to be smart but now I m just stupid.
Mmm. Hmm.
Why don t you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
Stay that way.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don t take him too lovely he might get hurt
Gently, son
" It s a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels... "
Don t get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I m sorry. But I m not gonna say I m sorry that much more.
I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show
FUCK YOU. I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down. I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven eleven, late, always late, loans I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest
Braces.
Yes.
Yes I do.
You were gonna ask me weren t you?
PLEASE DON T DO THIS!
Fuckin bullshit is what this is.
You do?
Where is he?
No.
I m trying.
She went out. She said she went out to run some errands. She ll be back.
She loves you.
When was the last time you talked to your son?
Memory?
Yeah.
I ve seen it before.
There s no asshole like you.
How come every word you say is either " cocksucker, " or " shitballs, " or " fuck? "
Go fuck myself?
I ll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill
Who are you gonna call?
Who?
Frank Mackey. That s your son?
No.
No.
Graduation?
Twelve.
What? Say it again... walking in the car?
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know And Bing Bam Boom I m away on a tangent I get so fuckin amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I m gettin pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
Go, go, go. I m givin pearls here. And I II tell you samethin else: I m not succeding in the bush because I m Frank TJ Mackey. If anything, there are women out there that want to destroy me it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans shit, she s gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, " Yaddda yadda yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn t anything, didn t get me. " So me? I m runnin on full throttle the whole fuckin time. Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey. Can I have a cigarette?
Let s talk about
It s fine. I can bleep it out.
Let s talk more about your background
Is that still lingering?
So boring, so useless
Thank you, Muffy. Funny thing is: This is an important element of, " Seduce and Destory: " " Facing the past is an important way in not making progress, " that s something I tell my men over and over
And I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
Yes.
In aid of what?
There s a lot more important things I d like to put myself into
Not really.
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go you re gonna be surprised at what a waste it is " The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me, " Chapter Three
I m not sure I hear a question in there?
I know alotta women and I m sure she remembers me.
Mm. Hm.
An old stomping ground is this the " attack " portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later Is " the girl " coming in for the kill?
Go ahead and waste your time.
And that s what you ve heard?
What am I doing?
So you sat it out, that s what you did?
Around here.
Hollywood, mainly.
My father worked in televison. My mother this is gonna sound silly to you she was a librarian.
Well I guess it doesn t.
She s retired.
She s my mother.
" Go Get Em, Honey. "
He passed away.
People die.
Not a problem.
From 84 to 89.
Right.
... this close...
I don t how much I went but I was enrolled. I was such a loser back then. I was misguided, pathetic I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you re eager to talk to because I was swimming in what was as opposed to I wanted.
What name? My name?
My mother s name, actually. Good question. You ve done you re research.
" Frank " was my mother s father.
Oh, yeah. No, no, no. They wouldn t
No, no, no. Certainly not. I wasn t officialy enrolled, that s right. Was that unclear?
... are you Phil...?
I got your message. That you were trying to get me right?
Is Linda here?
Yeah let s... maybe just stand.
Let s just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
For six months. I m the day nurse...
He s... I m sorry... so sorry... I ve seen this before, you know and you don t.... He s going very fast.... Frank... um....
I just... he was... but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine. He hasn t been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
Um... soon tonight... I think, yes? Tommorrow... I mean... very soon... very...
About three weeks ago.
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion
I m really sorry.
Oh yeah.
Uh. huh.
... ok...
I don t think, he can t...
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
Did your wife find out?
Then what?
That you shouldn t have done? That you regret, what? This? What s this? Fuck, man, c mon. Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an asshole.
All your other fluzzies?
You re making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
Yes.
If she asks me any question I want to tell her. I want to tell her everything I ve done.
I won t.
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
I need you to get me Paula
Yes. Now. Find her. She s somewhere in the building
Are you alright?
I m drinking.
As fast as I can.
I went to see her some fuckin asshole answers the door in his underwear, he s fifty years old, there s coke and shit laid out on the table
She went crazy. She went crazy, Rose.
I don t know. I have to go, I don t have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march
Love you too..
It ll take the pain away.
We just do it... we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
I m a bad person.
No, I mean: I m telling you this, now. You see? You see I want to make everything clear and clean... and apologize for me.... for all the stupid things I ve done.... that will eat me up....
Yeah.
Will that help?
I don t even remember... many... twenty... maybe more... not much more... twenty times.
I ll answer anything.
Yes.
Rose, I don t
No one else that I know?
How long with Ellen?
How long with Paula?
What about now?
Is it over cause you re sick?
Do you have any children with anyone?
Well maybe.
Do you feel better now that you ve said this?
I m not mad. I am, but I m not. Y know?
Why, well I think we ve, we both don t know... what do you mean?
Do you know the answer to this?
Did you ever touch her?
I really don t know.
I don t know what I ve done.
I don t know what I ve done.
Stay here, please don t leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
I don t know what I ve done.
No. But I probably will get a call back.
I ll get it because I m a good actress, Richard.
No.
What s MOW?
No... I just... I m so fucked up here Alan, I don t know... there s so much... so many things
If I talk to you... y know... if I tell you things... then you re a lawyer, right? You can t say things, you can t tell anyone, it s like the privelage, right? Attornery client, you understand?
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I m protected, I can say things fuck I don t know what I m doing
I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?... I need to
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that s
Adultery isn t illegal it s not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or Linda. Linda. Calm down.
You don t have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it s time.
Well. Considering that there s no one else mentioned in the will... we d have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is as if someone died without a will
The money would go to Frank. The court would put the money in the hands of a relative
Unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that s what will happen.
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time
I m trying to help, Linda
You need to sober up.
Linda
What are you doing?
Hang up the phone.
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I m sorry Earl asked me
.... it s alright....
What do you do?
We need more dog food
I need this one.
Should be one thirty.
You re late, not me.
I m fine. nothing.
I didn t know the answer
Stand up.
I m fine. I m fine, I just wanna keep playing
Yes.
Alright.
Go to bed.
Hi.
Hi.
Yes.
.... Why does he do it...?
It s not right.
I have money.
I have money to give you.
It s frogs. It s raining frogs.
It s raining frogs from the sky.
This happens.... this is something that happens.
May I speak with you? Alone?
I wish to discuss your brother.
First they told me he had died at birth. Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret. But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
He was my blood and I demand to know what happened to him.
Because I have dreamed of him. Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
He is your brother!
No, Louis! No!
Next week. This is a mere garden party and I wish to join it, so I will be brief. I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
I have demanded it and common priests present themselves! Can you imagine the arrogance? Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order! No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold. Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France! He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
How goes that favor I asked of you?
Don t look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you re going back to prison.
A body.
Excellent, Athos. You have a keen sense of this man.
Tomorrow.
You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
You are bitter, Athos. You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
Those are the words of a broken spirit. My spirit is whole. I have trusted d Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
I have it all worked out.
Those can be adopted
Do you think I have not considered that? I have a plan and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
Resting, he s had a long day. Aramis
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to
Three days??!!
You grow fond of him. That s good.
But what is Porthos doing?
But what is he doing?
He s threatened to do it, it s been building up in him for months.
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected. Do you notice?
Paris. There is still much to do. We ll be back soon. Be ready.
He can learn to be Phillippe in time. But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that. If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
You re a fool!
So what has changed?
Be quiet, you fat fool. Can t you see I m praying?
There are more important things than tits.
It is also a place of burial.
So they tell us. But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression? When no conscience is tolerated? No dissent, no objection?
I remember that night. D Artagnan was drunk, the only time I ve seen him that way. The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
Not just a baby, Porthos. I carried the child of the king.
No, not Louis!
I carried the king s child! The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
What use am I?
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
Who?
Who does?
You are right. But it is a trap.
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
We were at her door. I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady in waiting for the Queen Mother.
She cannot possibly refuse. Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do. And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
Never mind, Papa, it doesn t matter now. She loved me once. I want to die remembering that.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
It is already done. I have just stopped at Mother s grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine. When tutors answered every question except those about who I was. When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me. But a king...
There is... wrath... in me. I have learned to hide it. Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened. Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost. Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see! What if I become a king a king no different from my brother?
What is its antidote?
It is something I have done or did not do.
No! Do not be sorry! Never be sorry! The King cares for nothing and for no one! There are no mistakes when you are King! What you do is right for every person! A King has contempt for everyone!
How did you know?
Whose rooms are those?
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I m sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
That food has spoiled. That is why it was not shipped to the army.
Sire, I
How did I get in? You re new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
Raoul... is in love...
It s lovely. It s just...
I... we are humble people...
You would do that, your Majesty?
Sire, I
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend. And now he is dead and that is very sad but
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
We ran the i. d. I could have told you that.
Yeah?.. well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
If what you re saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
Cooperate?
What do you need?
So what?
You mean shut your ass down!
Where are you?
You set to go
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot. We pursued him into this warehouse but he s gone, south maybe a couple of miles if he s fast
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
When did you join the force? You know, the police force, the place you work...
Did you start out area six?
Yeah I saw em around. They worked vice.
Gotta come from somewhere...
It s just... catching up with me, you know?
And who are you?
I didn t break in the back door was open!
And he took a swing at you?
Did he harm the girl?
And what did he do to the girl?
You won t like this. I ran the prints from the house. No police record on your suspect at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
That s not all. According to the computer she died of a drug overdose last year.
No Zydowski I didn t read today s paper it s just going to irritate the hell out of me.
He said he was following up some lead.
Who is it?
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Yeah?
Up north.
Seattle.
No.
I didn t. I figured you leave it well enough alone.
I had to get away! My life was in danger!
No. A witness.
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room he blew his brains out left no note, you may have heard of it...
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals. I was in the bathroom when it happened.
I got out of there. I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
What did you do then?
What happened with the tape?
Yeah.
No
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
Well... whatsamatter? Run in with the law?
Tubbs listen! I don t know anywhere else to go! I need your help!
It s... it s a long story. Can we meet somewhere?
Hello Tubbs. Can I come in?
I killed them.
It was self defense, Tubbs! They re dirty! I walked in on something, I don t know what
They re inside the department, they re everywhere it s not safe.
I don t know. But I m in trouble. I m all over the papers. I have to figure out what s going on.
1490... Breckinridge...
No thanks. How do you know they can t catch you on this thing?
I knew I could count on you.
How about Marvosa and the others?
A bank?
Both at the same bank...
It s not very much to go on... is there anything else we can check?
I m not going anywhere!
Well I ve kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
I don t have any real destination. I m just going South.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks. I admit this is... unusual.
Are you serious? My boyfriend ditched me...
We were fighting I told him to let me out. So where are you headed?
Did you have sex with her?
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
Where is he?
I asked him not to tell me where he was going. I told him I don t want any part of it.
Yeah, and that s all I m going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
That was Peterson upstairs.
He doesn t think you run mind games on him.
You re never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You re smooth about it, but you re never one on one with him. Why s that? Do you think he s psychic?
Why aren t you ever alone with him?
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
That s when it happened?
What s the bottom line?
Could he handle a direct contact?
The usual motivation doesn t apply to him, nor the way he uses them. I don t have an answer for you. Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
How are Molly and the boy?
That s probably in the part Lecktor tore out. At the top it says: I hope we can correspond. And then the hole begins. It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
Right. What about sweating Lecktor?
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
That could be the tip of a t. Here and here. And here.
Book code?
Not the Bible?
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor s books...
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
Read it.
That s it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
I have to.
Because it s his bad luck to be special.
Nobody s better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn t like that part of it...
No. I don t like people who park in the handicapped zone...
I don t want to talk about it anywhere. If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
What was in the Miami Herald and the Times. Confessions?
What else did you keep out of the papers?
Somebody hurt him?
No.
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
You don t need me. I wouldn t be useful to you anymore, Jack.
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think. I came down here to get away from all that.
As long as they re dead...
He s working on the single print index. What time is it?
You said the guy down here is good.
What do you want to do?
Say we ve arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn t surprise you?
You can tell something about him or we wouldn t have found the finger print...
What s one way?
We re running it through the computers now. So far there s no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It s a haystack. What s the other?
No other possibilities?
Why?
See? You do know something about him.
The mark? Yes.
... there s three t s and an r in Tattler.
We let Lecktor s message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
Yes. And I m leery of running Lecktor s message without knowing what it says.
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
I ll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I m taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
It says: Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all. It s your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
Wait, Will...
I ll pick you up in...
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
What s it narrow down to?
That s narrow?
' Changes? '
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
There s no connection between the families.
What?
Let s admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream s standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it. You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene ll be very fresh...
What s that?
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in. They re in the far corner of the room under the windows.
Have him peel the top label back.
What?
How far away s the back up?
Wait for the back up! Will?
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I m sorry... He said tell Graham " broken mirrors. " '
He went to the men s room.
No. I can help you.
Why do you think I called?
You tell me what you know about him. I ll tell you whether you re right or not.
I don t think I ll tell you.
Most people are.
That s true.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I ll tell you if you re right or not.
What did he want?
And you said?
I m a forensic specialist, Molly. You ve seen my diploma? I got a diploma and everything.
We have it good, don t we?
What you ve already decided. You re not really asking.
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me. And Kevin. That s selfish, huh?
Huh? Will? Is that you?
Hey, baby! Where are you?
None you d notice. I m lonely...
Tell me about yourself.
Let s keep it the day to day stuff. How s Kevin?
Eating junk food. They don t have a lock on anything, Molly. There s not enough information. Or I haven t done enough with it...
I don t know. I m goin up to Baltimore this afternoon.
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let s paint it yellow.
Blue, then.
I remember.
You haven t smoked in two years.
No.
I wanted it over fast. It felt dirty to not tell you.
No.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
No. I have to be in there... alone. Maybe there s something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn t you call me?
Will? Are you okay?
I want to see you, too.
Mama has all Kevin s uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
It s what Kevin called her when he was little...
I came up here after Kevin s father died. They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I ve gotten myself together now, too.
Will? You could come up here.
That s not true.
Well, how you doin, Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer s dollars, too, I bet. On the news they said he was a white man. He isn t really, is he?
You going back down to Florida after?
My grandboy s been eatin a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat. I ll bet he s gained ten pounds. Molly s out in the motor home...
What s that?
I ll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you d probably want to be alone.
There s a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half inch VHS.
Go on to the house.
Are you George Sherman?
My name s Will Graham. I...
No, I m okay. I just wanted to...... stop by and...
Yeah...
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
I ll hang around in here. I ll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
No. You re very well protected. No one can find our where you are.
Yes.
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn t it?
We don t know that.
No. It s just my job to find him. I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
With a knife. I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar. I was going up these stairs to Hobbs apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying. I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn t wait.
No.
... after a while.
Huh?
Stuart is fine.
No.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
You ve read the transcript. It s all there.
It s in the transcript. What does it matter now?
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
It s about Atlanta and Birmingham.
You read about it, I m sure.
I thought you would have some ideas.
There are things you don t have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
You ll get to see the file on this case. And there s another reason.
I thought you might be curious to find our if you re smarter than the person I m looking for.
No. I knew that I m not smarter than you are.
You had disadvantages.
You re insane.
I don t think I ll persuade you. You ll do it or you won t. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he s the best...
Yes.
Yes.
No.
Good bye, Dr. Lecktor.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
That s interesting.
Yes. I d considered it.
I want your opinion.
When you do have one I d like to hear it.
I haven t decided yet.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
What do you want?
I m worn out with you crazy sons of bitches. If you ve got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
Fight what?
You should, Will. God s terrific! He dropped a church roof on thirty four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn. Don t you think that felt good? He wouldn t begrudge you two measly murders.
Pretty well.
Yes.
... commercially prohibited. Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They re hot loads. Body armor?
I hope you have a second chance...
You got it.
Tank you veddy much.
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
And this is a CLASS ACT! It s the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows! It takes place in a taxi stand! And you re gonna be the Fonzie!
George, I hate sitcoms.
" No "? " No " to which part??
I told you, I m not a comedian. And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
I refuse.
Those are my terms.
Hi George!
Of course. But only on Monday nights.
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
Hi, Andy. How s the weather up there?
But wasn t it funny?
WRONG! You haven t given them any clues that it s a parody!
What, you don t think I can beat him?
That s ridiculous. You don t even smoke.
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show. The best show anybody s ever seen!
So who s gonna pay for it?
You know Tony doesn t have that kind of money.
Ehhh, you know those guys. If he had his way, I d be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day. And anyway, I ve found a new guy who s gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Eh, I dunno... Andy. I m... thinkin of letting you go...
Sure! Comedy! Make jokes about the traffic. Do impressions. Maybe a little blue material...
Andy!
You know that s not what I meant! Look, I m gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone. You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
Twenty!
No no no, it s not sex! I mean it can lead to sex... but really, it s just wrestling.
I mean uh the colors in the sky are so vibrant. I love this time of day.
Hi... am I late?
No thanks.
Hi... am I late?
No thanks.
Gosh. Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
It s me.
I don t deserve Haagen Daz. I m a horrible person.
You don t know the real me.
They don t know... they ve gotta run more tests.
Even if I m dying I still need clean socks.
You re a wimp.
Then your father s a wimp.
You re a wimp.
Then your father s a wimp.
What?!?
Are you nuts?! 40 million people watch you every week!
No! Andy, don t do it
She ll say, " Now my son is a man. "
What is this, World War Two...?
It s a rave! Boy, if I ever fake my death, they ll really miss me.
Sure, because your new stuff s a bunch of crap. Kaufman, people are sick of you. The wrestling... the hoaxes...
I dunno. If they were, they d be pushin 80.
And you say, " Santa, what am I gettin for Christmas? " And he says, " Cancer! "
Um, yes. I haven t fought with them, since I started here.
I stopped drinking. I gave up drugs. And I m meditating three hours a day. It s the center of my life...
Why?? I... I attend every year.
It is apparently not working.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know! Wink wink! Nudge nudge!
Why s that? You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman
So your name s not Gorsky.
Isn t Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon? Maybe that ll chill him out.
Sure! But WE think it s kickass! Now I get to be Tony. I get to dump the glass of water on someone else s head!
Where?
What?
If you get caught using that
We re going to kill him. Do you understand that? He s going to die just like the others.
I... it doesn t matter what I believe.
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
Don t tell me you re a believer now?
Cypher? Where s Tank?
My God. Morpheus. You gave them Morpheus.
The Matrix isn t real!
Sorry.
What are you doing?
... Yeah.
Really?
How many were there?
What happened to them?
How?
I need an exit! Fast!
I got you.
Are they any agent?
Goddamnit!
They ll be able to track it.
I ve been looking for you, Neo. I don t know if you re ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time. They re coming for you, Neo. And I m not sure what they re going to do.
Stand up and see for yourself.
I m not sure, but if you don t want to find out, you better get out of there.
But what if...?
The agents
What do you know?
... Yes.
It s an honor.
You could say that.
You re Morpheus, you re a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
No.
Because I don t like the idea that I m not in control of my life.
The Matrix?
What truth?
This can t be...
More important than what is when?
A. I.? You mean artificial intelligence?
For what?
You you re too fast.
I think I do.
Yeah.
How?
Yes. She s very old. She s been with us since the beginning.
Of the Resistance.
She would say she knows enough.
She is a true psychic. She sees beyond the relativity of time. For her there is no past, present or future. There is only what is.
Don t think of it in terms of right and wrong. She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
Yes.
Why?
What do you believe in?
That s why we re here.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots. These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind. I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
Yes I do.
Morpheus, I don t know
Goddamn! It s good to hear your voice, sir!
Got one ready, sir. Subway. State and Balbo.
I know. You re Neo. Be right with you.
Bingo. Not quite what you were expecting, right? I got to say I love seeing you non believers. Always a pip. Almost done. Smell good, don t they?
I d ask you to sit down, but you re not going to anyway. And don t worry about the vase.
Who?
But what?
I m not the One.
What?
Morpheus. He almost had me convinced.
What?
How do you know that name?
Who are you?
Trinity? The Trinity? The Trinity that cracked the I. R. S. Kansas City D Base?
Gee zus.
I just thought... you were a guy.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger. I brought you here to warn you.
They re watching you, Neo.
What is the Matrix?
It s necessary, Neo. For our protection.
Why?
What?
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
That s different.
Are you worried?
Yes.
Nothing. Just had a little deja vu.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
We can t leave him!
I m going in after him.
I have to.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I m something I m not.
I m sorry, I m not. I m just another guy. Morpheus is the one that matters.
Why?
I m coming with you.
Do what?
No.
Any holes? Nope. Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old fashioned, home grown human. Born free. Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
The last human city. The only place we got left.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it! Ready for more?
They re hacking his mind.
They inject virus like serums to attack the neuro systems. It s like cracking a computer. All it takes is time.
What do they want?
Neo, this has to be done!
What are you talking about?
I know that s what it looks like, but it s not. I can t logically explain to you why it s not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed. I understand that now. That s why I have to go.
You re not far from Cypher.
So did we. I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
I ll be all right.
You re going to kill him? Kill Morpheus?!
What the hell just happened?
Yeah. But he ain t here now.
Well, we re here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we re still working on our album and...
Sounds good.
Look fella... this is private...
That means it s good.
Well the guy over there said...
And cherry bombs... ash cans... and rockets?
Why?
Can t we come with you?
Uh... can we give you a check?
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know. Like to see what kind of business you d do.
' And with your spirit. '
' Thou art then a king? '
Jewish...
She don t look Jewish.
Hide the gun. Throw it away. Anything. Listen, I gotta borrow your car... I think we should take a ride... away from here for the night... you know what I mean?
Kennedy.
It s an open ticket. I can go anywhere up to  350.
So I ll send you a postcard from wherever. If I get there.
Yeah.
Take it easy. I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
How about Teresa? I could talk...
And say what?
Panther! Same thing...
Sure. And you re gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
The number was 235 I bet it combination.
No.
What pipes?
That bad, huh?
Not next week s either... listen... you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
I don t understand, where s Groppi?
My uncle figured that this week was bad... but about next week... I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Isn t he supposed to be here tonight... I mean...
Michael, nobody s out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
Michael, believe me. You know the kid s a little crazy sometimes. I vouched for him and he ll come through. I promise. I ll talk to him and straighten him out. Don t worry, OK?
C mon Johnny.
Nevamind look... This punk bastard... I call him at work... I say Johnny Boy there?... He doesn t even show up for work anymore...
All right... but understand, I don t like being taken advantage of. I mean you re in there talking with your uncle and all... This is embarassing.
Nothin. Just stiffed those kids. Don t want em comin back and findin you... start asking you questions.
 20.
How much was the original loan again?
 3, 000. Shit! Can we hold it at  3, 000?
' But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute... '
' Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny. '
Fine.
I know.
Stripper?
Hostess?
Chinese food?
Why not here... Ok nevermind... 6th Avenue and Waverly.
Fine. Did you have a good time last night?
Oh... around... why?
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...... like your friend... comme si chiama... Henning? Heming?
Teresa.
What do they expect you to say?
What was it?
No, c mon... Y know, I read.
Wha?
Ok, we ll go for lunch.
Well...
It s all right.
An apartment uptown? Downtown?
Charlie...?
Anything specific?
What is it now?
Did you?
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable. The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared. Not half as much as we were though.
You missed the point. The kid s a climber... not very bright... but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man he gets a reputation. He thinks he s in good standing.
No... we can come back in a couple of weeks. Besides, if we re both gone for three days it wouldn t look right.
A paper on that one too?
It was nothing. I m almost finished.
I know you don t. You ve been very preoccupied lately.
Sure... He lives there?
You re intolerable today.
Well you can t blame them in a way.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
You ve been running round too much. Bet you ve been forgetting your medicine.
Charlie... I ve got to see you. I want to talk...
Not bad.  20. Here,  5.
Sure.
You ate?
Nothing s going on. Maybe he doesn t want to be alone. He s go ing to be sixty five in a minute
He s coming.
He s cute.
Hi, Allison
Not much more. Big day in the big city. What s on your mind?
Allison, I trust you. This is your thing.
Calm down, Daddy, you ll see, you re going to love it.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect
And you could care less
Who?
Conflict, honey. Korean Conflict.
Of course.
I like it. I like it. I m sorry I don t seem more appreciative.
Annie made them.
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America. This is orange, from real Seville oranges. Lemon, on a mille feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
It s for the party, Dad
It s starting to grow on me. But what do the B and P mean?
Do they, m dear?
Yeah? And what about my enemies?
That you ve been to Susan?
Okay. All aboard New York, New York!
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
But what?
The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Well sir, it s 9: 30 in the morning.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Good, good. Glad to hear it.
I m sorry, I don t recall
I thought you were buying my company.
Hello. I m Joe Black. Nice to meet you.
How would you like that, sir? On some kind of toast?
Include me out. I ve had enough of the conversations.
Daddy ll do fine. Besides, he s got Joe. And so do you.
That may be. But I don t like the fucker. I don t like the way he looks at you and talks to you. And vice versa.
That s it. It s over. Get out.
Bill s birthday is the day after tomorrow. There is a provisory by law in our charter. Per the discre tion of the Board, Corporate off icers can be retired at age sixty five.
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
Here...
Thank you.
Why yes, thank you.
Cold.
What an odd pairing.
Of whom?
But I know she s grateful for the care you re giving her.
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home
Well, it s a big day. Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts? Last minute refine ments or variations?
A voice?
What d it say?
' Yes to the deal?
Did you just hear something?
Sounds good.
Do you think I need a haircut?
Me, too.
Like a marriage made in heaven?
As close as a deal could be.
Yes.
What do you mean?
Sorry. I know it looks like I m reversing my field.
I am now.
' Just kidding?
Before I do I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
I thought this was practically a done deal
For how long? And why?
Okay, we ll see you tomorrow.
Yes, you made your feeling abun dantly clear. Now they want to do the same with theirs.
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou s offer.
I don t care.
Yours.
Bontecou wants a quick response and
Don t you want to hear the details?
So I am to understand from your re sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou s offer?
Certainly, Bill.
The Board didn t know you re a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
You get not to go to jail.
Quince, m man, thanks for the offer, but it s all set for just me and Bill. More people might
Thanks, Quince.
Are you?
' It s up to Joe? Those were his words?
' It s up to Joe, huh?
How did Bill react to the leads you ve developed?
But he was concerned about the timing?
' It s up to Joe?
Quince, you can t unscramble scrambled eggs.
He had no choice. You re a formidable adversary.
Well, you ve got him by the short hairs.
Obeah evil. I not evil.
I from dat nex place.
No, no. I on holiday.
Make it go way.
Not dis pain. Dis pain tru an tru. Make it go way.
None facety, mistah. You come for me? Dat s good news.
Doctor? What could be wrong wit you?
Yes.
You loved back?
She knows you real self?
Rass!
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an waiting.
Only flowers I wan see s one s over my peaceful self restin in the dutty.
Sure.
No. Nothing.
Didn t the family get together last night?
Good morning, Jennifer.
What?
Yes?
I didn t know that.
And you re a nice man, Quince.
Do I? I m a little confused.
Love.
You love Allison, don t you?
How did you meet?
' The deepest, darkest secrets?
What do you mean free?
I m lost.
You appear at his side out of the blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it s practically a first. You re in the red hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
Not the one I met this morning, hit ting on me in as nice a way as I ve been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I m my Dad s daughter, you act like a stranger.
I haven t.
Do you love Drew?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
I m sorry. Do you live here?
I guess what I m trying to say is I d like us to be friends.
I don t have any.
I have a certain function to per form, and that seems to take all of my time. Bu sometimes uh I speculate uh I haven t left room for uh anything else.
Yes?
Then why are you here, Joe?
I don t have any time to see you now. I m doing grand rounds and then I m examining back to back patients until dinner and then
Watch me do what?
That s impossible. I m a doctor, I m
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
I thought you said Be sorry for nothing.
It wasn t an intrusion. And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
Excuse me?
I don t know.
It comforts you, doesn t it?
I am, too.
We re doing what we can for her. But it doesn t look good.
Girlfriend?
Gay?
To bed.
Never tried, til now. Joe, may I kiss you?
I don t know who you are.
And is your heart beating strangely?
He must be tired this Bontecou thing
I loved it.
Nowhere? I m... here.
I love you in an evening gown.
It gets worse.
We know all that we need to know
Don t. That will come later.
' Love will find out the way.
It s a saying.
I love you now, I ll love you always
Yes?
Well, I don t know what else to say. It s a helluva party
' Threw you? Where?
I didn t know her. The body I took knew her. The man she met in the coffee shop this morning. I uh took him.
No.
Thank you. Would you like the man s name?
I won t.
That s the best I can do.... but minute by minute, I find myself lingering.
Your doctor? Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta? Did he mention an irreparab ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain? Were there any prognostications about the possibil ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
I hope you realize, Bill... in your office this morning, that was your time.
Not at all.
Good morning, Bill.
' Feeling? I feel fine. How do you feel?
And I won t tell anyone who you are.
It is a deal?
Yes?
What do you mean?
I guess so.
Of course.
Yes, Bill.
Make an exception?
That s what everybody says.
What do you mean?
Can you keep a secret?
No.
Are you sad, Bill?
You re not thinking of going some where, are you, Bill?
Glad you like it. My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches. Joan that was my wife
Why didn t you stop me?
I don t want anybody buying up my life s work and turning it into something it wasn t meant to be. A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it. And he wants it to be run the way he run it with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
And I don t need your goddamn permis sion either! You! Drew! I don t need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
I don t know.
I guess...
I wouldn t put it that way.
You tell me, Bill.
Hello. Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
That s okay.
' Fish?
Well, you re at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
I m her father!
Well, you goddam well should. You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi ness and with my family, and now you re spooning with my daughter.
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what. You arrive on the scene why you picked me, I still don t under stand
This universe?
I don t like your tone, and I don t like your references.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me. So watch it... Bill.
Yes?
Yeah.
I was just asking, Bill.
Say again?
I think you heard me, Bill.
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you re going to deprive her of it and you re telling me you re sorry? Well, I m sorry, apology not accepted.
How perfect for you to take whatever you want because it pleases you. It s not love
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in dulging. It s missing everything that matters.
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them. And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
With you?! Who is you? Did you tell her who you are?
I don t expect you to.
It s time to put this person where he belongs.
Prepare yourself, Drew I am
I ll take it from here I am
And we re very grateful.
Undisclosed conflict of interest
I guess you have your reasons.
I am not a dream.
Death!
You re not Death. You re just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
You fill the bill, Bill.
You should hope quite a while.
Of course.
Speak up, please.
' Yes is the answer to your question.
I don t!
I m sorry, I
It s enough now.
There s going to be plenty of time for that.
I think you know
What the hell is this? Who are you?
I want to have a look around before I take you.
It requires competence, wisdom, experience all those things they say about you in testimonials and you re the one.
Show me around. Be my guide. And in return, you get...
Time.
Watch it!
' Yes is the answer to your ques tion.
Bill. Come on. The question. The question you ve been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning. The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself
Good morning, Quince.
I m doing great. You ready?
How s that, Quince?
Thank you, Quince.
Next week?
Yeah, I give a shit.
You think Drew will go for it?
Please, Eddie, no Fat Lady Sings " shit.
Yes, the big celebration of my mandatory retirement birthday. You re an honored guest, Eddie.
Yeah Bill How are you? You okay?
The Board s working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing. But I want to give it one more try, I m still holding out some hope.
No, I m going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish. Talk to you Monday. Okay?
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time. As the custo dians of the company, you may re ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you or not. Either way, thanks.
How did you know?
Does Drew tell you everything?
You like him, don t you?
You re only six five once.
You mean like you loved Mom?
Uh oh
And I m your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
What were you going to say?
So what s wrong with that?
You re not listening
Don t get dirty, Dad
That s all?
Bravo.
I m sorry. But give it to me again. The short version.
You won t tell him, and even if you did, he d clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
A Okay. Got my gloves on, my ears pricked. I m ready for action.
We ve met.
Yeah, it s good to get together.
Raise away.
Then what will you say?
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo ten? What s going on?
When you say nothing that way, it s not nothing.
I don t understand.
Why? A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren t those things good enough for me?
Where s he going?
C mon! The guy s working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works
I want you to know how much I love you. That you ve given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
Not at all. It was fascinating.
You and Honey?
I m sorry
What s the way?
I agree
I was just being agreeable, now I ve got to explain why?
So you re a one girl guy?
Everybody s a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers. The guy I m waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
I could be her.
How bout another cup of coffee?
' Pro bono. That means doing good Going to be doing good all your life?
You d give up what you want for the woman you marry?
Did I say something wrong?
I ve been thinking... I don t want you to be my doctor. Because I don t want you to examine me.
Why not?
No
Just loud enough to wake me up.
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
I m Mr. Shelby from 304.
I m sorry... um...?
I think I may have. I m not good on the phone.
That s the thing. I have this condition.
I have no memory.
What s it like?
Couple days.
Seen you together, that s all.
This isn t my room?
When was I in here?
Why?
Why didn t you clean it out? 
Yeah, well you re not gonna remember, anyway.
That s right I did, didn t I?
A cop?
Who did this to you?
Thanks.
Interested in buying one?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Yeah, I remember you.
Don t say anything else.
I don t want blood on them.
Strip!
Take the money and walk away!
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition
So you have information for me?
Yes.
Yes.
But even if you get your revenge, you won t remember it. You won t even know it s happened.
Tell me about her again.
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
Deals?
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
Don t remember.
That s the problem! How can I find John G. when I don t know what s going on?! How did you get me into this?!
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he d done and asked for your help.
Yes.
Did you?
Kill him.
There are things you know for sure.
I know the feel of the world. I know how this wood will sound when I knock. I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up. Certainties. You think it s knowledge, but it s a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much. I know the feel of the world, and I know her.
What happened?
And what did he say?
Where is he?
I ll go see him.
He ll kill you, Lenny.
Yeah?
I told him about your car.
Somebody s come. Already.
Calls himself Dodd.
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
No!
Don t protect him.
Help me.
Get rid of Dodd for me.
Kill him. I ll pay you.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
That s easy for you to say! You can t get scared, you don t remember how, you fucking idiot!
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won t have a clue, you fucking retard.
Sweet.
What?
What do you want?
What are you here for?
Well, that s me.
How do you know about me?
Who s your boyfriend?
Are you Teddy?
Did Teddy send you?
Leonard, you don t have a clue what s going on. You don t even know my name.
That s who you were, you don t know who you are.
You know it?
Mr Gammell?
John Gammell?
You said you were leaving town.
So I see. It s good to see you. My name s Teddy.
You don t have to remember to be hungry.
Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he s here, right?
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Lenny, you can t trust a man s life to your little notes and pictures.
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
Think so? You don t know? Didn t you write it down?
He s got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
How d ya get him in here in the first place?
Shut it, Teddy.
I ll ride with him. You follow.
What s wrong with this one?
I m gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
Teddy. Your buddy.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You re still here because of Natalie.
From who?
Yeah, well maybe she ll make it you. Is that it? You worried she ll use me against you?
Why are you following me?
I won t be happy until you leave town.
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
Like how d you get this car? That suit?
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It s not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
He knows you re no good on the phone, so  he calls you up to bullshit you.  Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so  he slips something under your door to  frighten you into answering your phone  again. He s been pretending to help you.  Feeding you a line of crap about John G.  being some local drug dealer. 
' Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it s funny. He s laughing at you.
No. Don t worry, I m a cop. Everything ll be okay. Is he still breathing?
You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who ll listen. " Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis ". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that we all do. Who cares if there s a few little things you d rather not remember?
That s Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution! 
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol  Jimmy down there.
It makes all the difference. 
Yes, I will.
Somehow, I ll know!
When it s done, I ll know! It ll be different!
Why do you keep lying to me? 
No. You took them out. 
To set yourself a puzzle you won t ever solve. You know how many towns, how many  guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I m a John G.
Lemon or lime?
Gottingen. That s in Sweden.
Doing...?
What s your twenty?
Turn around.
I was the kids godfather.
" And " what?
He any good?
Jos  Yero changed up the drop plan on us. He s grabbed Gina.
They ll have surveillance on us. We ll know only at the last moment...
It s a rip and a hit.
You said Nazi Low riders...?
Tell them what you want.
... you d be operating outside territorial United States. Your badges do not count. You have no authorization to carry weapons. If you re busted, it could take a long time to get you re patriated. And there s no backup... And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
I mean full disclosure.
Yes you do...
You do.
Okay.
It goes very fast.
Bodeguita del Medio. It s the only place for mojitas...
Off a little alley with cobblestones. Hemingway went there...
Havana.
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
Angola. My mother was being a surgeon there. She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...... those days, in those days... she was part of Cuba s gift to the third world. She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado... we still have the house. We will go there...
Later! Do you dance?
No.
Died in childbirth, having me...
" Probable "... applies to an event that may be real. Doesn t apply here.
That s right.
Like " three thousand a ki? " That s nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on time than FedEx. But, three per ki was OK for openers.
Cost less. That s the point.
What do you mean?
Better than that. We become partners. Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don t pay us three thousand a ki. You pay us zero. Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash. " And why, " you re thinking, " would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping? Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas? " And the answer is, " of course " but also " no. It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can. "
Zero risk.
' Cause we guarantee every load. Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good. Your operations will, from now on, run risk free.
I need thirty. Calculate in, also, the cash you don t have to front...
Twenty eight point five.
I would say you re...... four percentage points away from a deal...
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
They re all the same. " Financial security is around the corner. " " Your friends love you. "
Why?
Do I need it?
Really?
When?
Of course.
Zanzibar. The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There s twelve hundred islands there...
This is the talk of a man... if he were your husband... he would never put you at risk. He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
A few more moments, still in this business. Then I d find you.
I know. And now?
Sonny Burnett... this is my partner, Rico.
" Extras " tried to relieve us of your weight... And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of " Things Aquatic "?
He tried to... " do business "... with you. Around ten. His place. Be there.
What d Neptune tell you?
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
The honey trap. And there s the honey.
Alonzo...
" No, viejo. That was Jos  Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall. "
What you get from us is a date. A place. " In the parking lot of a Jack in the Box in north Miami. " At such and such time, an eighteen wheeler will be there. Keys in the ignition. Ready to roll. You pick it up. And you drive it...... away.
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
Gina in the Miami pad. You gonna give me phony denials?
No.
Hit a couple of jazz clubs. Fell back to her place.
Verdado.
It s in the suburbs outside Havana.
No. Havana, Louisiana. Don t we have a meet?
No.
We re makin moves on each other.
And what does that level of spending on first class, private sector infrastructure signify to you?
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
Chill out Sonny.
As in...?
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
Do you believe... I have forgotten I am a cop?
What s the point? It s going down.
Twenty on my man...
Too fast. Too many moving parts.
Then you should.
This is Agent James Fujima.
What s your Miami PD badge number?
Okay. What s up?
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
" Buy and walk "? " Buy and bust "? " Reverse undercover "? What?
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
A Colombian producer. Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya Londono.
Who s the " we "? There s you and there s us. And all we got from you was bad intel. " Low level producer. " Yeah, right...
Have faith.
How will it stand up?
Sonny...?
Where s Riccardo?
Alonzo? What are you talking about? Where are you...?
Alonzo, what s goin on?!
... look after her. Ask Rico to. Okay? Do that for me. I had to do it. They had me from the gate. Do that. Whatever you can do for them. Okay? Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
We don t know. And that s the point. Maybe there s a mole. Whatever, it s a disaster. And it s a Joint Interagency Task Force. I have DEA, ATF, U. S. Customs components in on it. So the penetration could be from any one agency. What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
Yeah.
Yes. What s up?
... and thanks for the flowers.
What s it say?
... even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they ll find is more cover... Trust what you built. It s quality, girl. We re cool...
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju aymah?
Not French registry?
What would you do...?
Define small.
You set this up!
Meaning...?
Uh uh. No predetermined places and times to meet. Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
Alonzo...
You re hoping to get a look at what?
Hers n zodda meg a livig.

Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that gay fey is that your problem?
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don t mind if I do.

For money for what?

You like it? Take a look.
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
Forty second Street. Where n hell you think it come from?
The name s Rico, at my own father s grave, a man deserves some respect.
Yeah, well, so?
What you re driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy ass party.
Don t say nothing about you either.
Don t need a comb.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
Yeah.
And what?
What of?
Who?
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they re there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God s sake, wasn t any sicker n I am when he went to the doctor.
I m going to Florida, that s my only chance.
I ll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that s all I ask.
They gotta be.
How n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
I been thinking. I hope we re not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what s the whole point of this trip anyway?
I mean New York s one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he s going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells Hey, Ratso how does that sound to you?

Yessir, I can see that.
Well, uh, I m raring to go.
Uh, yessir.

Getchmis...?

History, man, history. How much?

Could be ten or fifteen. Maybe even twenty.
What?
How s your hernia?
Nah, just covered with batshit!
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
Shit.
... Don t worry about it. I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we ve got to get you out of here. You all right?
Bad. She couldn t make the trip. You know Her boy... Susan told us before we got your letter. She s fine; she s trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
Dad... I ll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
The Hilton.
For the money... 
Sure.
About ten kilometers.
Not far. Just a little way.
I ll pay extra
All over. Turkish Army up there. It s against the law. They shoot us. You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Good. There s nothing to be afraid of. If you co operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
Would you recognize him again?
Stupid.
But just...
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
Beats working.
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
A hundred grams.
That doesn t seem so bad.
He wasn t even in the car?
How long?
What do you mean?
And?
What do you mean?
Where is it?
Yeah!
What? You gotta be joking.
Yeah.
Then we re outside the kogus. Then what?
After we re outside the kogus?
Cut his fucking throat.
I want to cut his throat.
You know where it is?
Max where?
What?
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
You can t take anything seriously.
My passport!
What is it?... Billy?
Cat, ah! Ayip!
Look, you don t fuck with me, I don t fuck with you, right?
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay? We ve to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Was..... seven years old. I was on street in Suk. Buy. Sell. No family to take care. I learn.
That s a great philosophy.
Work, work, work, that s all do
Mr. Yesil.
It s not important, just technical things. We make our case. You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don t worry.
Who?
Who got the Frenchman out?
What s your name?
Okay, Jeremy... go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Immigration s gonna love you for that.

Weird shit...?

Oh, man, there you go again.

" Mistake "? What s that supposed to...?
The kid s with them!!
I pull.
What?
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
"... and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man... "
Manny...
Please.
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
Okay. So you lost a great specimen
Maybe they lied to you.
I heard how you talked to him.
Fuck em. They don t know what they re missing.
You said that thing was big as your hand. I don t think I m going to miss...
It didn t bite me.
They don t know anything Peter, they just sense. They re hardwired!
What
Peter
The scent won t last...
Your arm, you can t...
Ah...
Gross. What is it?
I m on it. Don t worry. Look, Susan... I don t mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
I just... well, I had this cousin in Delhi. She was having problems, too. She, ah...
What is it?
Fuck! It broke the skin...
Sorry, didn t mean to startle you. You didn t give me a chance to knock.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
I know. It s so upsetting. I m his number one fan... I ve got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I m so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...... here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven t invited you in. Please.
Sure.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
Well, I just thought oh, look at me. You d think I d never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
I always say if you can t enjoy your own company, you re not fit company for anyone else.
How long...?
What are they...?
Will I be able to walk?
Say that last part again, I didn t quite hear
I didn t know it was going to be a big storm.
It shouldn t be too much longer. Once the roads are open, the lines ll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I ll keep trying them for you. Could I ask you a favor? I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and... and I wondered if maybe...
If you wouldn t mind.
I don t have a title yet.
It s crazy, but I don t really know, I mean I haven t written anything but " Misery " for so long that you read it you can tell me what you think it s about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
Nothing.
Oh, it s ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
Well, it s brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
The swearing, Paul. There, I said it.
It has no nobility.
Then the roads are open...
The phones are working?
My daughter must be going nuts.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
I guess that means it s okay.
Well, you can t believe everything you read in magazines.
I m getting to believe you.
She s a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
The Sistine Chapel?
I know how that can be.
I m...
Yeah, thanks.
Well, it s not something you should enter into lightly.
Well, I hope you like it.
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery s spirit is still alive
I DIDN T...
No one she just died she slipped away, that s all.
Perfect.
I don t suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
Show me the way?
Yes.
I know this may be difficult for you, but it s for the best.
No big deal.
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split. God knows you re entitled to it.
You re right. You re right. I don t know what I was thinking. I ll tell you what. It doesn t have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I ll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
I don t know.
Great. I ve always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could ve gotten me to burn all my books.
That s the big surprise. Your new studio after all, writers do need a place to work.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
Don t worry about that. You ll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
It s two of the letters in my favorite nurse s name, Annie.
You did great, except there s just one little thing I can t work with this paper. It s Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long grained mimeo.
I thought you d be interested. I d like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it s written.
No, just the paper will be fine.
Annie, what s the matter?
You know goddamn well what I ve been doing I VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
I want my pills NOW!
Yeah, well I wouldn t expect too much.
What? What happened to " I ll treasure whatever you do? "
I really value your criticism, but maybe you re being a little hasty here.
Not fair?
Cliff hangers
They always cheated like that in cliff chapter plays.
I can t write this anymore.
I m telling you, I can t.
The what?
I said that?
What?
... have to wait.
Have to wait.
Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
A toast?
Wait, let s do this right. Do you have any candles?
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
You really think so?
Why would you lose me?
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
What?
No, I haven t.
I don t know, it s weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn t done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
Why, what are you going to do? Kill me? Take your best shot.
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
Be my guest.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
Maybe.
I m glad you like it.
You ll know very soon. I m starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I ll require three things.
You don t know?
I m almost done.
You ll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
Work, work, work. Virginia? When was that blizzard?
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn t crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door someone pulled him out.
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
What?
That s nice.
Oh, I like that tone.
What thing?
What is it?
It s good you found it.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
He s your client, huh?
I m sure you know Paul s been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn t that a little strange?
You think he might be missing?
Maybe you can, Libby.
No long distance phone calls, Federal Express packages anything at all out of the ordinary?
So do I...
Buster.
If I can.
We had a batch. Sold em all in three days.
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff. Lest you call paper odd.
No, the typing kind.
It s... it s nice, Paul. It s got... character.
You re still a writer.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery s Child was the most ever over a million.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter s teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
I m glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they re not going to say, " Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we ve always wanted: An esoteric, semi autobiographical character study.
Did they win?
That d be a first.
Great.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I d be drummed out of the agents union what about a non fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
All done, chief..
From her point of view or mine?
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
I left in a bit of a hurry. I m terribly grateful, Sean.
Well that depends.
How hard you had to work to get me out of there.. how in the world did you ever find me?
How do you that.
Mmmm.
I suppose I did.
' Thief in the Night? '
Then don t say it.
To do what?
And you re going to have time. There s been a change of plans.
Yes. We won t be able to have dinner tonight. Something s come up. I hope you don t mind.
Ulrich will be about. He ll look after you.
What are you talking about?
Good. Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
An outbreak of Chimera.
And you re happy about that?
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you. Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
I knew where it was.
Yep. You ve provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
More like two two point two million.
Ninety three point four million.
A myth.. just a myth... shouldn t you be checking out their countersurveillance?
.. or hard wired..
Not at all. But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
What are you talking about?
Exactly where is she?
And the check s in the mall.
No. Should I?
No. Just as if I d like to.
Not tonight. Bad timing. Sorry
What if I pay the rent?
Think you re the only one who can pick a lock?
Torque wrench.
Hey, you put me here. I just do what I m told.
Indeed.
At least you walked.
Wanted to see how good you were. I m hoping we might work together.
Working under adverse conditions. Highly adverse conditions.
Hi. Would you mind slowing down?
Listen to what?
Your help? What are you talking about?
Ethan Hunt.
Care to wait a decent interval?
Oh. Well.. this isn t exactly by the book.
They ve got a book for everything.
Not revealing information doesn t necessarily make someone a liar.
Which is?
You re not a liar. Or you re an awfully good one.... this thing these blokes pinched..
Damn, you re beautiful.
Five, six hundred thousand.
And six billion in the world.
This wasn t what I had in mind, Nyah.
I d like a little more conviction..
You ve either got it or you don t. Let your conscience be your guide?
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
I don t.
Generally, I don t favor coercing someone. Not when there s a chance my life could end up in their hands.
Can you think of a better one?
Look, would it make you feel better if I didn t want you to do this?
What wouldn t make him suspicious?
This doesn t seem to be accomplishing much.
How can you possibly? I ve got to get right on the plane. I m leaving now.
Oh, I do. But as we know I m a very poor judge of character.
Yes?
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I ll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I m gonna bail and without giving two week notice.
Just like old times.
Michael, his driver s an Aussie, new to me. Then there s the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
How do you suggest I go about it?
I am now. Get me out of here. Just get me out of here.
Nyah, it s very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
I guess I lied.. You can t get both of us out of here, can you?
Then you ll have to kill me before it s too late. Before I start killing people.
No. You just looked as if you did.
Don t be. Wouldn t be on vacation if you did.
Why did you phrase it like that?
' You re sorry and I m sorry. '
Like?
Twice.
You know we had reservations about each other. Isn t it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
In any case, you ve got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
Right. In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
Well you know Nekhorvich s history. You re the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio weapon business.
Is where Miss Hall comes in.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously. She walked away and he s wanting her back ever since. We believe she s our surest and quickest way of location him.
Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
Well, then I mislead you. Or you made the wrong assumption. Either way we re asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn t already done.
You mean it ll be difficult.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won t stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don t know who else we re looking for all terrorist bank accounts of which we re aware are stable. No deposits, no withdrawals. Therefore no suspects.
Do you? Even assuming you re able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you ve now got an additional problem. You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte. If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he ll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall s blood to market.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
She sacrificed herself..
Aren t you even curious? About why she did it?
You d like me to conduct my own debriefing.
I d thank you but I m not sure that was a compliment.
Yes, I gathered as much.
Yes.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
In this case, it wasn t a bad idea. In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don t make a habit of it. And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged. I m assuming you approve.
Where is she now, by the way? Do you know?
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Put in the coordinates and let s get a visual. The visuals aren t coming up.
That simple, huh?
Left jacket pocket?
Confirm. Left jacket pocket.
She must still be on the property.
Yeah. Why else would he come back to Australia? If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
She s on the North Head Bluff approaching the cliffs. One klick away.
His name is..... Dimitri Miediev.
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
So what do you suggest?
Same thing he wanted in Prague! Same thing he s always wanted! The NOC list!
And if we don  t find him we  ll search the whole train again.
High speed train. No one gets on. No one gets off. High security. Good place for a pass off to Max.
He  s putting on a show, Barnes.
This is bullshit we don  t even know what Max looks like.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?.. Why..
All ten million.
Now we don  t have to eliminate him? You like that, don  t you Claire? Don  t you?
Always.
Krieger.
We got it. On your feet.
Walk, just walk. Start walking.
Talking s good, walking s better.
If you re gonna do this again Claire, It s not gonna be on my watch.
I wasn t. I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio. He said someone was...
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
Take off your coat.
I walked away. He said abort. He was gone so I walked away.
Who is " they? "
I m going to get it for him. Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can t find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he ll find me.
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
You re sure about this?
We need help, and we don t have time. They have to be local.
You don t think we re going to make it.
You didn t have to.........
What about you?
We did what we had to do.
I sent the message to Max. We  re on for tomorrow.
Is this the only way?
Kittridge is Job. Max delivered. How far is he from Luther?
Of course I  m sorry to hear you say that Claire.
This stuff is so sticky.
It  s all right, Ethan.. you  ll bring me back... won  t you...
They  re dead.
My team. Claire, Jack, even Jim Hannah, maybe, I don  t know
They knew we were coming. Golitsyn  s dead too. The disk is gone.
Do you read me? The list is in the open!
Don  t think, be sure. Are you clean?
Location green. One hour. I  ll be there myself.
Heard a lot about you, Hunt. Don  t disappoint me.
Yeah. I follow you.
Who else is left?
Why was there another team?
Of IMF agents. At the Embassy. Tonight.
Let s see if you can follow me around this room. The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o clock... The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase Bowtie, 12 o clock. The other IMF team. You re worried about me. Why?
The arms dealer.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
This whole operation was a molehunt.
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
I see you ve been out visiting the folks.
Certainly Ethan.
Information.
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that.. With that exceptional piece of work.
Luther, I guess you re all out of excuses.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
Exactly, that s your job. Tomorrow on the train, you can t let this list get out into the open. What s the range of this thing?
About what?
Hey, I m the flavour of the month!
Sure. They want me back in so I won t break in! They still can t figure out how we did it.
I figured I d let em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and then, maybe, talk about it.
Why don t you come back with me?
You really liked Phelps, didn t you?
Oh man... I don t know. I m gonna miss being disreputable.
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
Why not? You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
That depends.
Whether you like a paradox. I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
The disk Job sold you is worthless. It s bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Like Job?
I m NOC. Was. Now disavowed.
That s the question I want to ask Job.
Even so, I m sure you could arrange an introduction.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list. The one you have is not only worthless, it s certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you re gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Tell you what. How good s the RF scanner you used in the car?
I don t have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession like a warm blanket. My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan. Obviously it didn t pass muster. Deal s off.
Six million dollars. I ll give you the same. But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe. I won t do this piecemeal, it s too dangerous. I want the entire list, the true name of every non official cover agent throughout the world.
Done. Bring it to me in London. I want it by the end of the week.
How will you make sure I ll have the list in three days? It s been a delight. Now where can I drop you dear boy?
It doesn  t, dear girl. as long as you tell me where the money is.
What about Job?
Bank?
Where exactly is it?
We ll see.
Roger that. Opening doors now.
Higher.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Why?
You misunderstood. No one sees Max.
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you ve got to say.
If Max doesn t like what you have to say, you ll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
A hundred and sixty seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want. After this one.
What the hell s made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire s in a weird mood too.
I don t know, I had to go to Chicago again. You were in Kiev. You tell me.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss. What the problem was you and Claire had in Kiev?
Ah, God, forget it. What are we talking burnout here?
Ethan, you can t burn out.
He s our guy.
Not this week. This week he s flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
No, not in a hurry. What do you think? You think the plot ll work?
Can you lose him?
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
And picked us up in the States
Yeah, smaller countries don t computerize customs records
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
Yeah.
We don  t have to, Jim. He  ll come after us.
What he didn  t get in Prague. The NOC list.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
You  re probably right.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash. I  ll call you from Paris.
And get a doctor.
Of course I can hear you.
Loud and clear.
I don t know.
Jack... that s spying.
Jack you re so wicked.
Connection denied.
It  s not working.
I always check the batteries.
No, I m going.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can t explain.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
What?
Thank you, Rose.
Yes.
And go to confession.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it s great and about time. What s she gonna do with the rest of her life she don t get married?
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He d stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it s not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn t think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn t know no better.
Bed.
I can t sleep anymore. It s too much like death.
Ti amo.
What s your news?
Again?
You did this once it didn t work out.
What killed him?
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don t get married again, Loretta. It don t work out for you. Who s the man?
Him? He s a big baby. Why isn t he here with you telling me?
More Bad Luck! I don t like his face, Loretta. I don t like his lips. When he smiles I can t see his teeth. When will you do it?
I won t come.
I didn t give you away the first time.
Maybe.
He did?
It looks stupid. It s a pinky ring. It s a man s ring.
Everything is temporary. That don t excuse nothing.
What d you do to your hair?
What are you doing here?
Who is this man? You re engaged!
You re my daughter. I won t have you acting like a tramp!
Alright. I didn t see you here.
And what did they say?
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
I don t know. I got a feeling.
He s in Palermo.
Yes.
I m going to marry him.
Yes. Do you want...
Excuse me.
Maybe I should come back another time.
That s the bad blood between you and Johnny?
But that wasn t Johnny s fault.
I m making you a steak.
I know that. I do what I want.
Loretta.
He knew my husband who died.
Bus hit him.
Instantaneous.
Why what?
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
Stupid.
Seven years ago.
Just Johnny.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
What? Do you think you re the only one ever shed a tear?
You think so?
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn t get married until I was twenty eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn t know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can t. She didn t leave you! You can t see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
The big part of you has no words and it s a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away. So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free. Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I m right, I don t care what you say. And now you re afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That s why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
I m telling you your life!
No!
Because I have no Luck!
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
Where are you taking me?
Me neither.
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
Get all of me. Take everything.
You re mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there s nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
That light.
I ve never seen a moon like that.
Take it easy.
Don t just become excited.
You re trying to make me feel guilty.
All right, I m guilty. I confess!
She didn t like me.
What did you do?
You ruined my life.
What?
I can t do that!
I can t!
I ll come to the wedding.
But he wants me to come!
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Hi.
I thought I d try it. You look good.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
For what?
It s the best thing there is.
Awful?
Yeah.
How can you ask me that?
You are guilty. I m guilty.
I know what I know.
He didn t come!
You re late!
That s right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why?
I was.
I don t know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don t care if I burn in hell. I don t care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they re nothing, I see they ain t here. The only thing that s here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn t. I couldn t take everything in a hundred years. It s the way we are. We compound each other.
No.
No.
Is Johnny here?
No. I m gonna wait.
Loretta, what are you talking about?
What!
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
And who s gonna pay for that?
No.
I m thirty seven years old.
Johnny has a big apartment. We ll live there.
I d like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don t like Johnny.
She s dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Where you been?
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
Cosmo s cheating on me.
A wife knows.
Well. I don t really know where to start.
Everything s different.
No. Are you drunk?
Where s pop?
No more he s not.
She recovered.
It was a miracle.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Hey there... YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
Did you see it?
Oh.
What sins have you to confess?
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
That s a pretty big sin.
You should think about this.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
I don t know.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
I m not disturbed. By you.
Will you join me for dinner?
What do you do?
That woman was a student of yours?
There s old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
Don t shit where you eat.
I m a housewife.
I m not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Why do men chase women?
I think it s because they fear death.
I teach these classes I ve taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it s rote, it s the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I m droning along and I look up, and there s this fresh young beautiful face, and it s all new to her and I m this great guy who s just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman s face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn t last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I m just a burnt out old gasbag and that she s as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
Yes.
No.
No. I think the house is empty. I can t invite you in because I m married and because I know who I am. You re shaking.
You re a little boy and you like to be bad.
I m too old for you.
What? What?
Oh.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can t own the moon.
Is who down there?
What would he be doing down there?
You were a tiger last night.
Shut up. They ll hear you in the back.
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What s got into you?
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Tell me... what do you do with witches?
Does wood sink in water?
Wait. Wait... tell me, what also floats on water?
I am... And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot.. I must speak with your lord and master.
Yes!
... What?
So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
Through... We found them.
What do you mean?
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
Not at all. They could be carried.
Please!
How d you do, good lady... I am Arthur, King of the Britons... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
The Britons.
No one live there.
We don t have a lord.
I am your king!
You don t vote for kings.
' Allo. Whoo is eet?
This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
Well, I ll ask him, but I don t think he ll be very keen. He s already got one, you see?
Oh yes. It s very nice   CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER turns to some others.   MAN  I told him we already got one.   They all giggle. 
Of course not! You are English pigs.
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
Bedevere, my Liege.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere. Explain again how sheep s bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
No. Ni! More like this. " Ni "!
 It s not working. You re not doing it properly. Ni!
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings King Arthur.
I do. You seek the Holy Grail.
A G... g... g...
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
What?
There.
It is the rabbit.
What?
It s always the same... if I ve said it once.
Man!
I m thirty seven.
I didn t know you were called Dennis.
I ve said I m sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked...
Well... I AM king.
Yes.
Yes, I see.
Be quiet!
Shut up!
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Bloody peasant!
And don t apologize. Every time I try to talk to someone it s sorry this and forgive me that and I m not worthy and... What are you doing now?
Well, don t.  I really don t know where all this got started. It s like those miserable psalms. they re so depressing. Now knock it of
Right. Arthur, King of the Britons, you re Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times...
I m getting better!
You re not fooling anyone you know. Isn t there anything you could do?
Thank you, sir, most kind...
I m not quite dead, sir...
I think I could pull through, sir.
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Farewell, Concorde!
Yes... I m very sorry...
Er, Well... the thing is... I thought your son was a lady.
Didn t mean to? You put your sword right through his head!
You even kicked the bride in the chest! It s going to cost me a fortune!
What the curtains?
But, Mother...
But, Father, I don t really want any of that.
But I don t want any of that, I d rather...
I d rather... just... sing...
Listen, Alice...
Herbert... We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
Don t like her? What s wrong with her? She s beautiful... she s rich... she s got huge tracts of land...
I m... your son...
I was saved at the last minute.
Yes. It s not a very good name, is it? But we are nice and we shall attend to your every... every need!
What is your name, handsome knight?
No, It s nothing!
Oh... hello...
Why?
We ll cover your escape!
I don t think I was.
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
No. It s unhealthy.
We must examine you.
Back to your bed! At once!
You got my note!
You ve come to rescue me?
He s come to rescue me, father.
Look. I m warning you.
Brave, Sir Rob...
I didn t.
No, no, no.
So, there are rules. Things you do and things you don t do.
You don t tell Her Majesty how you feel.
Seventy a year.
How about yourself?
It s better than shovelling horse shit.
She s hardly a full hamper herself.
Three years, John. Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
Come on, man. There s love and there s...
You know what I mean.
The good looking one.
So? Someone ll send it on ahead.
John, it s not your problem what she eats.
They said you were drunk. Why don t you tell her the truth?
I m getting dressed.
I ve got my duties to attend to.
She ll be worried about me.
I can t let her down now, Archie.
Oh, I m much more than that.
You watch your tongue.
You know nothing about her!
Aye.
It s a diary.
I can t move to tidy.
Mr Brown, sir
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Your Royal Highness. What a pleasure to see you here.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
Of course.
I see.
A situation?
I m flattered you think so.
She s busy.
She s away to Windsor tomorrow. Talk to her there.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
Whom you address.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
It s so infernally cold in here.
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie. It should be discouraged.
It is quite late enough.
Brown s responsibilities are onerous enough already. He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o clock.
And that is my last word on the matter.
How will I know?
How will I know what she requires?
Who ll bring it to me?
I need a man who knows where I am.
I came down at the Queen s request. I ll take my orders from her.
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it. You know that very well.
You will await your orders like everyone else. Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday s little excitement.
Is that the Queen s request?
She ll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
There are important papers from
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
I don t doubt that the Queen was highly amused. She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
I am a blank sheet.
Occasionally.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
I m fine.
It s nothing.
I m not married.
I wouldn t know.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
Maybe, once.
Why?
I do what I do.
Aye.
I said. I serve the Queen.
Why do you think I keep her here?
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public. John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
See what?
They aren t as watchful as you.
The greasy pole.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
In time, she will.
Ma am.
Aye, ma am.
I am.
I ve no family, ma am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Archie.
Yes, ma am.
Yes, ma am.
It s a fine spot, ma am.
Aye, ma am.
What?
Craobhan geanmchno fhiadhaich.
Are they worth reading?
Who by?
What does he know about the Highlands?
That doesn t make him an expert.
I don t groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn t matter to you.
I hope they didn t go to any trouble, John.
To keep out the cold.
I ordered it. It s for your own safety.
Aye. But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Yes, ma am?
Yes, ma am.
Yes?
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
Have I ever let you down before?
I m breaking no promises!
For god s sake, woman, I m just trying to keep you safe!
Then why send me back to them?!
Someone has to look after you. It could ve been someone. It was before.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Yes.
The cartoon or Her Majesty s absenteeism?
The question is, do we need her?
So?
You can t know that for sure.
Who?
It s questionable whether there s any advantage to be had from that direction. She s never been less popular.
She s refusing to leave Balmoral.
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move. Frankly, the Queen s rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity. You re smiling.
Not too protracted, I hope.
Dear oh dear.
Yes.
Cold is good!
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
Just them?
What is he doing there?
I made no request to go out riding today. How long has he been there?
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
I believe he is unwell, ma am.
I understand he was in a fight.
A few days, ma am.
I m very sorry, ma am. I can t imagine he was certainly given no instructions.
Why?
We were expecting you to return by six.
Again?
I have no idea.
Your Majesty
What is it?
From whom?
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort. Do I make myself clear?
How do you stop The Screamer?
If I tell you, then it s no fun.
What s the question mark?
How do you do that?
Well, brain dead anyway. Coma patient. It s really not all that important.
He?
How d you know it was us?
It s the game, ARCADE.
Neither are we. Something s wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Everybody s sick, huh? It s fifteen after. We always meet here, you know that.
Did you play ARCADE last night?
I came from the city on the left.
Yeah...
Have you played the game yet? It s incredible! I was just...
We are talking...
It s twelve thirty!
I m in the middle of it...
Alex, I think you re freaking out. Greg s gone, I ll give you that. And maybe he s in trouble. But it s not ARCADE that s doing it...
How?! It s a machine, Alex. Machine s don t think. They re not alive. It s a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it s not alive.
It s the middle of the night. They re asleep. Phone didn t wake them.
No way.
It doesn t necessarily mean she s...
We can t...
What?
Nick, what is it.
... but then it hits the relay stations...
It s already out.
Give me a break, Alex. What are we going to tell them? Excuse me, officer, but there s some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines. I d think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
What?
And beat it at it s own game.
No I m not...
What are you going to do?
Dante s Inferno.
Put in a quarter.
Yes I am...
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
What?
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
One. In case...
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
What?! There s nothing here!
One of them, anyway... Did you see it? The Screamer?
I know.
I m okay.
And then keep on driving?
Yes...
Is that your question?
You have no time. What is your question?
That s impossible.
It changes. There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe. The concept is, you re entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core... ARCADE s brain.
Can you say anything but " cool "?
I am The Liar. Where should I take you?
Give her a chance, will you?
What s going on, Cynthia?
What did you say?
No.
I m going home.
I m going home Cynthia.
I know. Where are you Adam?
Someone called me. When they couldn t get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn t believe then, so I made some calls.
You re broke!
I know, but you re broke. Where are you?
The Cowboy??
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
Cynthia... what s going on?
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
You gotta be kidding?
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
I m just offering a place to stay.
Okay, but you don t know what you re missing.
There is no problem.
I ll speak to someone.
Yeah.
No problem. What s on your mind?
Whatever.
Sure.
I agree with what you said... truly.
That a man s attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
Okay, I m thinking.
Look... where s this going? What do you want me to do?
One.
Okay.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank s gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
You re an understandin fella.
No, this one doesn t count. It s part of the original one. So then... until we meet again.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Well, I...
You probably don t remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn t drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
That s good. They re allowed, but I don t like em... for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn t believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard... let s see your Aunt s apartment... it s a good one.
I told ya.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here s the key and you need anything, just give a holler. Everybody in this building s pretty much okay with me or they wouldn t be here. If you want, later I ll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don t, and don t forget the rooftop garden. It s just up the stairs we passed. It s open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
I was afraid of that.
It s just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn t know any Ritas...
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
It s all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
His name s Wally Brown.... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Naw! He wouldn t have cared. Just give him a good performance and he ll be happy and I ve got a feeling you ll do just that.
Right. See ya.
Yes.
Very pleased to meet you.
What?
I... I mean...... I... it s none of my business.
She sure is. She s letting me stay here while she s working on a movie that s being made in Canada, but I guess you know that. I couldn t afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I m discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I d rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you d say, sort of why I came here. I m sorry, I m just so excited to be here.. I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I m in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
But, this could be serious.
If you have a concussion you shouldn t sleep.
I don t know who I am.
What do you mean?
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass... I think about that sometimes... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That s about it.
You don t remember anything else?
Unh, unh.
Mulholland Drive?
Maybe that s where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Maybe it s not me.
Maybe the voice isn t Diane Selwyn. Maybe that s your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
I m not sure about this.
" My parents are right upstairs! They think you ve left... "
" I can call them... I can call my dad... "
" You know what I want... it s not that difficult. "
" What about you? What will your dad think about you? "
I m all right.
Good luck!
But I don t know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I d just get in trouble. That s why we shouldn t go see about Diane Selwyn... it s better not to get in trouble.
What is it? What do you see?!
Do you know them?!
C mon help me in. I ll open the front door.
What... I.. HAVE... to do.
But I want to.
It sounds kind of nice... being somebody brand new.
No, no, no, I told you. They re fine. They re all real happy.
Gotta keep an eye on her, that s all.
Nothing... I don t like being out in the open like this.
I just wanted to come here.
This Denny s.
Go ahead.
Oh boy.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
To get rid of this god awful feeling.
Unreal... so, you re looking good. Whatcha doin these days?
Making ends meet, huh.
Yeah, look at my digs... times are tough.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
Not a coke or anything?
A brunette?... maybe beat up?
You ll keep your eyes open for me won t you baby?
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything?
I m an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
What s going on?
Leave him, he s dead.
Why should I?
You re both embezzling. I saw the records.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
No where. We ve got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
I m working on it.
It s called Murderland. It s paid for by First Bank.
It s a tax write off for John C. McCay.
What?
Look I don t even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
I M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW!
NO! I wouldn t do that.
I m not listening.
Not listening!
I m listening.
We drown.
Once the room depletes it s oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
Excuse me?
Is this really the time?
I just graduated from M. I. T. in engineering. That s when John McCay hired me.
But how do you know if the people are guilty?
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty?
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel..., how does it feel?
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
What do you mean?
I ve since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn t or wouldn t do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It s a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven t seen in ten years.
This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay s Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
What do you do with the company, if I might ask?
You didn t think about it did you? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
Know what? That it was your fault?
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
You don t. It s random, there no trick.
I work here, remember?
Well, surprise, surprise, I ve been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York?
That s a shame.
Well, I ll see you at the next staff party.
Yes, can I help you? Maybe a donut or something?
Who are you anyway? What the hell is this?
Wait for what? i don t wanna alarm you but we ll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes!
Either you ll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you re fucked any way you go.
I d get out of the water if I were you.
A dragon.
Why don t you tell us a little about yourself?
What the fuck are you talking about.
Knock yourself out.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
What?
What? Are you my mother?
Not yet.
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers?
When will that be?
Look, you re going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
I ve been working with you for four years, don t you think that s worthy of at least one turn at the controls?
And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up? Who gave you a job?
So?
He probably has a history of this shit.
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don t you think?
Checking..... Hah! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
Yeah, but we re talking 43.
We have new " guests " for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce?
What did you hear?
I was.
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
What are you looking for? A blow job?
Then what do you want?
I didn t think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new " Park ".
No I am not.
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it!
I have a turn for the worse for the team!
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn t as tough as I thought.

What happened?
How can this happen?
Go in there? What if Bruce finds you?
Thank you.
Do you want to go out with me?
Yes.
Yes.
As appealing as that sounds...
Hi. I brought some wine.
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
If they re so rich, why are you working at all?
Like what, a Porsche? A Ferrari?
Actually, I m more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool?
Shut up! It s me.
What?
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
Hey buddy. You okay?
No.
Why don t you shut up now.
Good morning.
Actually it s down. 2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Are you writing a poem?
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
I was drinking a little in those days. I m drinking a little these days too.
Oh I doubt it... lectures are notoriously boring.
I m not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn t pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don t get paid till delivery.
What are you gonna do? Tell them that... a polite person helped carry your bag?
Don t mention it.
What about giving the other guy a break.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
I think the phrase was  quot; Sleazoid Geek  quot;.
What do you remember about her.
Suspended from school, my mother??
Pommeroy.
I m leaving Sunday.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo s room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we re gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there ll be a lot of noise....
Well you know what I mean.
Me? What makes you think there s something on my mind?
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
No it s okay, I understand, really.
Hey, why don t you just keep your room and we ll put the baby in the back yard.
Oh yeah, right between the power mower and the weed killer.
Seriously?
What boy likes you?
Okay, we need wallpaper paste. Hey Cece!
Was it a nice funeral?
Of course.
Honey I know it s fun to think about these things but....
What??
Thanks, I needed that.
Hi Dad.
I just called to say that I m having a really great time.
Totally groovy huh?
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Oh she s fine... ahh... umm the doctor just... ehh... told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and... n stay quiet... just... just to make sure that...
I love you too sweetie, bye.
She just had a baby that s all.
Uh huh, a boy, you ve got a new brother.
If I eat it I ll throw up.
How about a nice glass of milk?
No.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she s on the brink of...
Oh come on Harry, we re talking about five days here.
Oh. Ohhh?
Ummmmm, look, I... I...
Oh honey, back then... people did crazy things.
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
You are?
Hillary Mitchell? How s she?

That s all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother... she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and... special effects.
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning... audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
Well, we didn t have a camera... so she just wrote the date on the bag and said,  quot; This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.  quot; We never did.
More than anything in the world.
Umm... didn t you ever wonder about me?
I thought that... umm... maybe you d be curious about how I turned out.
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you... and then I was born, so I thought that... maybe you got divorced because of me.
Well...
Oh.
Come on in!
It s just a corpse.
It s Kevin, I don t want him to see me.
He likes you.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
It s okay with me, hi Kevin.
But I wanna write about her.
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
Hi.
Ehh... I m staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you re the best Jag people in town... so uhm.
Then I have come to the right place.
I m Sam Helburn. Sam.
O. K. Thank you very much.
If you re selling Girl Scout cookies I m borderline diabetic.
My mother.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
Thanks, but I think I m gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
Give it back Nicholas!
I... ahhh... umm... I m thirsty.
I want juice!
You re over reacting!
MOM!
No THANKS!
Yeah, RIGHT.
And you re gonna solve the mystery?
I wasn t eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
It s not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I m lost. I can t just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
WHAT??
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
What difference does it make?
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won t amount to much, so don t be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?... It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
I d never do that.
Change my name.
What if you don t wanna be found?
This ll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
You would.
And I thought I was weird.
This isn t just a mood ring.
Well, it doesn t open cans or anything but it... it s sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Well, I hope he s not watching me all the time.
Don t force it, you ll break it.
Give it to me!
Just give it to me!!
DON T!!!
What do you mean  quot; Uh Oh  quot;???
In the tar??
Montgomery Clift, wait till I tell Shelly.
I m afraid your feet won t fit in there.
What do you think?
And you d be my cousin?
But we wouldn t really be related right?
Good. I mean...
Like what?
Nick?
Some sacrifices are worth it.
I wouldn t say it was terrible... it was... kind of...

I ll write you ten poems. Bye.
Ten bucks.
For the mini bike fund.
Well I know you re not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so... I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
You re a good man Nicholas.
I m not a Podiatrist, I m a Cardiologist.
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK 150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn t be handing out relationship advice.
They re great.
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
Ahh, that s right, like one big happy family. This is Nick s room and uhh....
That s ridiculous, I m... I m very, umm, what do you call it?
Committed.
How s this for a solution. We ll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Then again, your dad s got his own memories and he s got his own life now... I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
This is it I guess.
You want me to come with?
Okay... take your time... I ll... I ll go for a walk around.
Dad already gave me this lecture. He s gonna meet me at the airport, then we ll go for some pizza, then we ll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I ve gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
He wasn t touching me he was just... gesturing...
Phil for God sake.
Oh... what s that?
There s plenty of fruit.
I m saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
You know exactly... what kind it is. Come on Rose... what do you want from me?
You know how I feel about you.
Not exactly.
She ll be all right baby.
Nothing, nothing at all.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I... ehh... I just drove in from Chicago and uhh... nice hair.
I was commenting on your hair.
I m a pediatric cardiologist.
Yes, I do.
Well maybe for you.
Well let s just say you re lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
You couldn t?
Sort of?
Where I come from, involvement... generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
All right, so you don t like jewelry but... eh... you do like... eh... good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Oh, sure okay.
Is there milk in them already?
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Why do they call them training bra s? It s not like learning to ride a bike.
I don t know, Dad doesn t either.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day... instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry cleaning.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
Well you ve gotta be prepared.
What do you mean?
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
But Dad ll never go for it.
Hey! Oh look.
Beidermeyer that s it, what a mad man.
He is?
Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I m sorry my mother wouldn t go out with you, I m sure she would have had a really great time.
Vada!!
Good for you baby.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
WHAT?
It s her home! It s where she lives!!
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how d you find me here?
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that s what the lawyer said, it s supposed to be  quot; OUR MUTUAL ASSET  quot;, not  quot; Shelly s recreational vehicle  quot;. Gimme the keys.
What?
I m impressed.
That can t be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Yes.
No.
Vada, what s wrong sweetheart?
What Hurts Vada?
I think it s still available.
Uhh, Miss devoto...
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it s a Funeral Parlor.
Yes they are.
Deceased.
Pardon?
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
You d be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you d normally wear for work? Don t get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
This was the Reverend Porter s wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
What do you mean??
Oh that, she just likes to play.
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
Excuse me Harry, I m sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room s all set up.
I shouldn t stick my nose in other people s business. It s just that I like Vada, very much.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Oh, I m just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it s a service we provide for the family.
I wrote that.
I prefer it to  quot; instead  quot;, it has more dignity.
It s no big deal.
I haven t been to the movies in AGES.
What s that?
Look, it s not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
Oh, how do you mean?
It s nice.
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
Are you mad at me?
I don t know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
What happened to her?
Did she ever see Vada?
Here?
See, you re not that out of touch. You re good.
Want to what?
Yes.
It s only eight o clock.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
It s for Shelly s famous potato salad.
Pointing upwards Look...
Perfect.
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there s a car crash, or there s a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of em!
Dad?
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
That s a lot of money for a little girl.
I love this guy!
What?
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
You never cared before.
Why?
Can I go too?
Hi.
Feeding my fish.
Yes.
No sweetheart, you can t.
He was allergic to bees.
What??
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
Nothing, I m dressing.
I m very nervous.
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
Oh come on.
Are you sure about all this?
Oh, I m running late. Shelly ll be here any minute.
No, she s just driving over here, then we re taking my car. How do I look?
That s what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Hi, is Vada home?
Oh, I m Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I m sorry about Thomas J.
Will you tell her I came by?
Thank you. Bye.
He likes her.
Probably.
Yes I do, and I think she s very good for your father.
After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
Yes it is.
I think you d make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
My ball, I lost my ball.
Can we look around in your camper?
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
Uh huh.
No, I m divorced.
Can I use your bathroom first?
You don t have to wait, daddy ll be mad if you re late.
No.
A girl s always gotta look her best.
Have you ever tried any?
Yes, Vada I think you re very pretty. You ve got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
They ll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Uh huh, why?
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit. We used to be married.
Nephritis? It s a kidney disease, you don t get it from hot dogs.
Vada, Vada, what s the matter?
Well he just left, what s wrong?
What do you mean you re hemorrhaging?
I m eleven and a half.
It s actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn t have been a Vada.
I ll pay it back, besides, I don t think i ll ever go to class again.
I will I promise.
I m allergic to it.
Uh huh.
What are you saving for?
That s Mr. Bixler, let s go talk to him.
Why? It s not dinner time yet.
It s not a real school, it s a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
I m gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Oh no! UUH.
I m trying.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
It ll bleed.
Uh huh.
No.
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
That was Grammoo s. It s a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i ll diagnose your head.
What?
Hey, where does it say that?
Yes.
It s my mother.
No. Grammoo said she s in heaven.
What?
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody s best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there s no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
It doesn t matter, cause they re not regular horses, they got wings, and it s no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
Don t DO that!!
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I m out here.
I told you i ll get in trouble.
I am not.
We re not gonna bet, we re just gonna watch.
Go???
What?
So?
You re right, let s knock it down.
I am running faster!!
But I have my clothes on!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
I wanna live with them too.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
You re such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
I don t like her.
He likes her better than me.
Then go home, baby.
Leave then, some friend you are.
No, I m hiding out.
Hi Vada, can you come out?
I m gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
It is not.
Not true.
Like they do on TV?
No.
But, I don t know how.
Uh huh. Okay, enough practice.
Okay, okay.
Umm, Ummmmm
Well, let s spit on it.
Okay, seeya. Vada?
Would you think of me?
I should look different.
I honestly wish I could...
Which is everyone you couldn t get in.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you re setting me up w...
Kindred spirits.
I have a suggestion...
No, he s ruining yours.
You have a real philosophy of life.
I can see why.
Chill? Since when do you say ch...
I noticed. I m on the noon back. We have this thing with George s family in the Hamptons.
You like her.
Go figure you.
You ve been working on this, huh?
And you believe that.
It s not his happiness you re feeling guilty about...
Impressive.
The man you love.
Someday she ll thank you.
I wish.
Try less appropriate.
Major. Dish.
Tell him you love him. With all your heart.
Tell him you ve loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
Tell him you re afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
Well, we re...
Can you watch the road?
Which was the disqualifying factor?
What? Because I m a little understand...
A trademark move, don t touch it.
It s been awhile. I ll take your word.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
Let me rephrase that...
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
No.
I was gonna predict that.
I ve missed a step.
Ju...
... always. The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
Oh, that. I forgot I even said th...
Exactly.
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
Don t you see...
WHY DON T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
... look good on Kimberly.
It s Jules, you guys haven t had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
I had this crank call? From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin, on her wedding...
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
It doesn t say th...
Well, somet...
But they re so down to earth, such wonderful people...
W...
Such as.
Hate that.
Endearingly absent minded.
Quite the little eccentric.
She admires. Tommy Lasorda.
She finds him " personable. "
What, leaving school...
I never eat when I m serene.
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
Except for the hot affairs we ll have twice a year.
Me, too. I m getting married tomorrow.
" Mike, the funny thing is, he s offering you a gig you d be stupid to turn down... "
No, it s for the best, it really is. We were so wrong for each other.
Look, I came down here to face everybody. I didn t want to slink away like some coward...
She hasn t told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
And your point?
Oh, yeah.
... yeah, that.
... wrote it, yeah. I m the bad guy.
Lower.
It s two weeks.
Course, if it s later rather than sooner, I d hate to be you at six o clock. You ve got a lot of explaining to...
I travel every week. College ball, motor sports, training camps...
What is that sup...
Well, if that s the way you f...
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
She s going to rest now.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
Barnett, John Triplette. How s she doing?
Well, I just thought I d call.
Haven? Hell, we ve been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
He knows better.
How is that?
Whose word?
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
They can come to the concert in the park.
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
Nothing; Barnett. It s my job.
A little slow, but she ll be fine.
Who the hell is he?
Who the hell is he?
Third party?
What does he want?
What!
You know better than that.
Yes. She s pretty rested up.
Oh, no, listen, I don t want to take up too much of your time.
Whose?
ABC.
D. C.
National?
Sure thing. Put them here... I ll take them.
She s in Paris.
Not yet.
Your brother?
Harvard?
What is a turkey shoot.
How in the world did he get shot?
Sure do. Good friend of Haven s.
Ester and me did; My niece picked then. She s just here from California.
Hi, Sherry.
Yes, ma am. How are you today?
I m fine. Can I go up?
Can I help you?
She sure sings nice.
Okay... you get to sleep. I ll see you in the morning. Good night.
Glad to see you. Ester ll be glad, too.
It s hard to say. Doctors thought she d come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
What did you say?
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
Replacement party.
A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He s developed a huge following.
Well I ve been following him around Just listening to him He says he can really win I bet he can too
Well, he s really amazing.
I m in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
No.
No.
No.
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
No.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I m here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen... somebody stole my handles.
Do you carry door handles?
Nash.
I ve been so worried, dear. where are you?
Oh... Well.
Oh, well, I knew that before you even left. I told you, Kenny, that old Nash won t make it down the road. But you had to go.
Next you ll be sick.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Green? Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
Bet the sheets are grey.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Well, you ll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
Does their hair fall out?
I ve been a Little dyspeptic.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Yes yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy s a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
When I was little, in church.
Yes, it is
It just is.
About three years.
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
No, I don t.
No, mostly his wife s. She s in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert s in law. Does work for him.
Linnea?
I m here.
Tom. You remember?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
Who is this? It s Tom.
Wow!
Who is this, right? I called you last night.
I ve got a gig tonight.
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
I have to go.
I have to go. He sighs.
I can t.
I m not sure.
Older.
Well...
Oh.
That s unkind.
That s what you said before.
Oh.
Oh.
I m not sure...
What?
Fifteen minutes?
What...? 0h, yes.
Yea.
What?
Hundreds of times.
Hello.
For him?
You re doing some recording here, aren t you?
You re not.
Sleeping.
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Oh?
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Did it break?
How long have you been together?
Do you study at all?
Yeah, you bet. You re really terrific. You know what I mean?
Hello.
Oh yes, I m John Triplette.
Why?
What?
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
No, we never did that
We re connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How d you come to work for him?
You do?
He ain t really new.
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
Where are you from?
You always live there?
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
No kidding Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
Who?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
You really do?  God How come you know them?
I ll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn t that be something?
Is that good?
You think I should take lessons?
You serious?
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
I m John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You ll be fine.
I see.
Yes you are.
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn t believe in belts.
Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
That s what Tim said.
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
The key lime is great, but it s an acquired taste.
When ya had it, did ya like it?
It wasn t till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren t gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, Oh my God. This might work. But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn t any doubt in his mind. It s not like there was and he just didn t show it. He knew it would work.
I wondered how long it would be before we d get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
Haven t you been listening to a fuckin word I said?... Oh, I m sorry. Can I say fuckin? I can t, can I?
How do you intend to disappear? you re probably the most famous couple in America.
Are we in a big hurry?
Yeah.
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We re the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor s care, where hopefully they ll receive the help they need.
Well, since that time, they ve killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they ve killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
What s changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
Thank you, sir.
You been followin the news coverage?
Susanville, Soledade.
I can appreciate that.
Lobotomy Bay?
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
By all means.
I see.
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
She s in the holding cell, on this floor.
She was born without a tongue.
What?
There s a chocolate cream filled in there?
Tough titty, it s mine now.
Not good.
It s video.
Ready.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Whose ratings were higher?
How bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Good... yuppie piece of shit.
How bout Manson?
Yeah, it s pretty hard to beat the king.
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
She doesn t talk?
She sings? What does she sing?
All right, Mickey.
Don t worry about it.
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
Do you miss Mallory?
Then was it worth it?
No, Mickey, I can t let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven t seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
You ll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we re not even the same species. I used to be you... then I evolved. From where you re standing, you re a man. From where I m standing, you re a ape. I m here... I m right here... and you... you re somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
It s not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You re gonna have to do your job.
I m sure we will.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She s pretty, she s got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
That s indescribable.
Says who?
Sure.
Let me check on Scott. He s hurt bad.
Yeah, we have a van.
Out front.
No.
Probably not, but we re gonna give it the old college try.
On average forty million.
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
No. Not really.
Then you ve seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
It s like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can t see each other, yet they know they re there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
They can t because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
And a snake eye glare.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
They ve hypnotized the nation.
That s the way of the world.
Just for fun, I guess.
Mickey stops sawin on my leg and says, Oh my God, I m your biggest fan! '
They were especially influenced by Conquering Huns of Neptune. '
Where do the air ducts lead?
It s hard to say Capt n.
I ll say enough to destroy this wing.
That s my opinion.
I m as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican s head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
What s the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut
Wayne
Rockin!
Well, Mickey and Mallory can t be together. So, we ll put you on one of our prison busses and you ll take Mallory first, then you ll come back for Mickey.
We got his stinkin ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he s got a special visitor.
Wayne Gayle.
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
They re real Goddamn good. They ll be there for when ya need em. Where are they?
How bout Mallory?
Yeah, sure.
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
When do you want the assembly?
Why?
How so?
But you ll never be whole again.
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott... Roger... and Unruly Julie... this is... I m sorry. What s your title again?
Everything s coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Is that her real name?
Now, Phil, I don t know if you ve ever been on a set before
Really?
Well... small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members
See what I mean? It s a funny business, isn t it?
Lose em.
Don t recite the fact to me. I m sure I know em better than you do.
Wayne, if it was anybody else
What are we talking about?
Okay. I ll take two guys off.
I can t do that. Five guys.
And me.
Why don t I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Don t call my men assholes.
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca Cola.
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
Out.
No thanks.
What s the matter, Doris? Business bad?
Everybody givin it away free, huh?
See Duff. He s the money man.
You think so, Frankie?
That ll be thirty eight cents.
All right, you get out of here, man!
I ll smile when it s funny.
Where was that?
What did you say your name is?
Guess you must be lookin after my boy. I m Duff Anderson.
Where s Wilma?
Ain t she goin to take the boy?
I been sendin her money.
Like where?
Okay.
' That right? I thought he was up North.
Where s he at?
Name s Duff.
Okay.
Thanks.
Guess I don t.
Okay.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, I been there.
Why don t you come over for a beer when you get through?
You must be new in town.
No. I m new in town.
You work around town?
Went to college, huh?
Oh yeah? That s my home town.
No. My mother s dead. You goin back inside?
No. Never had much use for hell howlers. You goin?
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
Look, I don t know what you been told bout section gangs, but how bout seein me sometime?
What d you expect?
How d you mean?
No.
You don t think much of yourself, do you?
You keep asking me why I m here.
I like a place with lots of life.
No thanks.
That s right.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
That s fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
Well, I don t get on so well most places.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
It s hard to see any change. But I m going to stay. Another year, anyway.
It s better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn t say anything.
I get it. Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot gun right now.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby I wouldn t go round stickin out my jugular vein.
You almost got into trouble back there.
Hell, baby, I m not in the third grade. Well, look what we gonna do next time have a nice long chat in the parlor?
Oh yeah, and then what?
Well, either we re gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don t want to hit the hay, and I don want to get married.
All right, so I m primitive. So what d you want with me?
Hell, baby, I don t know what to say.
Why did you?
' Been up north?
No.
That s the way he is.
What d you mean?
Look, Duff if you re free, I m not working tomorrow.
Just for the day?
I didn t know you had one.
Are you married?
No. Women re always followin me round.
Yeah, it s just a coincidence.
I ll see you later.
Four.
What?
Okay, I guess.
How about it?
Look, baby I don t know bout you, but it s the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d you say?
Yeah. Wouldn t be no picnic for you. I ain t exactly housebroken.
She don t mean nothin to me. That s all over. Hell, baby I m askin you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
Well, what d you think?
Don t call them that.
He could live with us.
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Am I as good as they?
You didn t answer my question.
You still didn t answer my question.
Uh huh. Why?
I don t want to hurt you.
Huh?
You jivin me?
What about your boy?
I keep thinking about him.
You will.
They won t.
We can always do that, Duff.
Don t ask, baby huh! How much money you got with you?
Water pump s busted. I don t know if it s worth fixin, but I need that car.
Sure, baby. Fact, I don t ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
Yeah!
What the hell could you do?
I can t stand to see you like that. I know you can t help it.
I don t know. I guess I m not afraid of them.
Just of getting hurt. They can t touch me inside.
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
What d you mean?
There s nothing to say.
When I get set, I ll send for you.
You ll be better off without me. I ain t fit to live with no more. It s just like a lynchin. Maybe they don t use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
Duff
' Round town.
How bout the key?
Like what?
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
What you signifyin?
Yeah. That s right, Jocko. Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
What s eatin you, Jocko?
Who re you?
Wouldn t have known you.
What s on your mind?
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Plannin on getting married?
' Don t sound so sure.
I heard you.
Great.
That s right.
Better get him to a hospital.
No, thanks.
She don t look no worse to me.
Don t do her no good to go into a tree.
I said, she s in great shape.
Whenever he s got an edge on.
No thanks, Lee.
Sure.
I guess I ll make me some trouble in that town.
That s right.
No, they won t.
I can always chop cotton if I have to. If you want a ride, I ll take you home.
Okay.
Hell, I m just like him.
Who is?!
Man, why you messin around with a gal like that? You won t get no place.
' Musta knocked her up.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don t know any tricks.
What d you know about women, Pop?
Hell, I didn t know you was married.
Hi.
What s the matter?! You mad at me?
Nothin. She s all right. Wouldn t have made it without her. Christ haven t worked in eight months. Right now, I m waitin for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more. Let s get out a here. This place gives me the willies. You got some money?
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
If you don t quit it, Will, I m leaving.
I ain t drunk, honey.
What s the matter now?
You hate Raoul?
Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
Danny, I can t fucking wait anymore. You hear me? Now where the fuck s my wife?
Omar, listen to me
Don t give her the satisfaction. Your wife is on her way...
That s not the play. Omar ll get a shot off. I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
Since when?
I m still on my honeymoon.
I will. Inside. There s no other way to get the gun off the girl s head, Nate.
I ve had quite enough or I wouldn t be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren t Peter s illusions to your liking?
No. I only needed the code from you.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won t allow it.
My man s coming to get my ass out of here. That s good enough for me.
It s nothing. C mon... we ve got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
Gettin in is easy. It s getting out I m thinkin of.
How s the villa s security?
I was set up. She looked at least eighteen.
You son of a bitch, you re crazy.
You ve got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I d like to hear what it is.
What does this have to do with me?
Put the Sense / Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
First, let s get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there s much more entertaining ways than working for me.
We ll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
I don t call this fun, pal. You re playing God with my body.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It s an A. I.
This one s different. No one can trace it. It s out there somewhere in the matrix and it s growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
Dixie McCoy
I ve arranged for him to work with us.
I know. You ever work with ghosts, Case?
You ll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you ll use McCoy to trace the A. I. s coordinates.
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that s all you need to know.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Could be your A. I. s calling card.
What about McCoy?
Prepping your trip.
Offworld. The A. I.... this " Wintermute " thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
You ll be linked during the entire operation.
He s a Sense / Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A. I.?
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
Then once she s in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
What are you talking about?
I don t have a girl.
You re pleasant tonight.
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Yeah. That was me.
As far as they know, that s absolutely true.
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
All things possible in Babylon.
Don t know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Jah guides us.
Right...
You re Dixie McCoy s construct. That makes you something special.
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I ve got to nail that thing where it lives.
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
No problem, amigo.
Those guys couldn t even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass. Tell you what, Bro. I ll make you a deal. I help you nail this A. I., you gotta do me one favour.
How are we doing?
Can you take me to it?
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
It ain t getting any prettier, that s for sure. I got the I. D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn t make sense.
No. It s gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
We got problems topside.
We run. You crack the pattern?
You can make your move when it comes after me.
How s the ice break?
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I m on my own countdown.
Less than thirty minutes.
Don t worry, Dix. I m on a roll.
How s the ice?
It s coming.
I said, it s coming. Just get me in, man.
Then I ll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I m making the run, Dixie.
Case.
What?
I thought you already left.
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
This time it s different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo s score.
Why should I want to meet him.
What s my end?
... a friend of mine s gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Couple of months.
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
I know who he isn t. Not C. I. A. Not Sense / Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He s onto something.
The way I feel, believe me, it ll help.
What the fuck... are you serious?
You re not ready yet. They said two days.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It s a buzz, right? Like getting high.
A regular Fagan.
Too late?
Won t that mean you re dead?
Dixie McCoy didn t.
Don t fuck with me. I don t want to hurt you.
Case...
I don t sleep much. You packed?
Yeah... Yeah, I m fine.
I ll be okay.
Something exotic I hope.
That s risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
... And if I guess wrong?
We ve still got to find the mainframe.
What is it?
Surviving, darling. It s my specialty. Only this time I m doing it my style. I ve beaten him, you know.
Everybody s favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don t translate well on microchips.
What?
I m Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
Well, do you?
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T. J. Maxx parking lot.
Thanks.
Petty good.
College?
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don t even go to prom. But to everyone else it s huge.
Yeah, I know.
Are you kidding, Josie? It s lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It s lame.
Yes, it s lame.
 uhh, must have forgotten
Right. 7: 30.
Last night. 7: 30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don t even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Leave.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
Listen, I don t have any plans you want some help?
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
I thought this was a 45 minute seminar.
Roger in Op / Ed.
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, " I have a date with Roger from Op / Ed tonight and I m going to do it with him. "
Yeah.
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Jos, that s not what we re
Anita, remember espadrilles?
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
That is lingerie.
What d you feel when you kissed him?
' Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Anita!
Yeah, but I m okay. I ve got some work to do.
Hidden camera.
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants " Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts? "
Transitioned?
Do I want to be crunched?
Five Six
Yeah the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
Geller, we ve been over this. You re a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You re not a reporter.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
A flack jacket.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He s aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
Geller, you don t want a reporter s life. They re very messy. You re all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
But I don t want it straightened out.
And you re leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Have you been there?
Have you been to any parties?
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
No, it s the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen you re in over your head. This is how it s gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
You re crazy. I can t I can t no. No.
He s my teacher!
There is no lid! Nothing s going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
You know what? Why don t you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this " Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold ". What about you? What are you thinking about?
Josie, you rock my world. You re like the most amazing girl I ve ever dated. You re so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
Maybe because we re not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
No it s not. Guys name their penises.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
No, it is. It s just one more thing to add to your " things that make you a better person than me " list.
See!
I m not going to college, Jos. And I m not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
You can t just " borrow " my car for a couple of months! That s like ten years in Bambi life!
Do you remember high school?
I know. I came up with it. You look nauseous.
No. They re at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It s impossible.
Oh my God! You re at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Don t you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Is that true?
Yes, desperately.
Better than I...
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn t over I just thought it was! I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me I m into the minors it s game time!
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I m popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
And a gymnast!
Rufus?
Thanks. And what are
Wasn t even thinking about
I
You like her?
Not the happiest of souls. " Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop. "
True. I guess she hadn t completely given up hope. Are you sure you re seventeen?
Because seventeen year olds do not like writers from the 30 s. They don t even like people in their 30 s.
Oh I don t think so.
Thank you.
College. Haven t really thought about it.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don t go to college. We just go right into sheep herding.
Thanks. Wow. That s really nice to hear.
I m gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn t undermine my position as an authority figure. I m a little afraid of heights.
Actually, it s more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
You remember that story?
That s what makes you interesting. As a teacher.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
I know.
Why do you do that?
When are you going to open your eyes?
Thanks. They weren t related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
That s really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us
Do you think you ll find her?
What! But I wasn t even going to go to college
Oh yikes!
Wow. You believe in me that much
Well, are you here with anybody?
No, surprise, I thought you d be
You were attracted to me?
Wait, I was going to tell you
But now you don t have to
I did exist. I do exist. I m the same person!
What?
Why?
The poem! I knew he liked the poem! Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
I m handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I ve been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that s changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
Thank you. I m Rob.
Well, a ball player.
Jack said we should work together.
It s getting there.
Dad s fixin something again. Hit the deck!
Just out for a while.
Oh, come on Dad...
It s not the gas, Dad!
What are you talking about?
I wasn t sure, Ken...
Oh, please...
Are you nuts or something? What the hell is that going to do?
Where s Jesse?
He can t hold you Jesse. He s losing his grip you can get out.
Could be all night. Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S  M joints downtown. Likes prettyboys like you.
What about it?
She s a neighbor, I drive her to school.
You got a problem with me, Grady?
What the hell are you talking about?
It was okay.
My Dad. He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
Yeah, well, Schneider s got a stick up his ass today.
I m sorry...
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
I m scared, Grady. I know it sounds crazy. But, there s something trying to get into my body.
Look, I don t care if you believe me or not...
How come?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Who, Grady? Grady s alright, he s just a hothead.
Who?
Like a haunted house, right? I don t believe in ghosts.
Yeah, I know... synapses neurong...
I don t know into the air I suppose.
I don t know. Where are we going?
What do you mean?
C mon, cut it out.
About what?
Maybe it only happens when you re sleeping that s the way it was with Nancy, wasn t it?
Whoa!
I m fine. Nothing s wrong.
Yeah, I had a bad night.
I m not hungry.
Why won t you talk to me?
He s just waiting to take me. When I sleep.
Huh?
Okay, I guess.
How d you sleep, honey, okay?
Hi, Kerry.
All of them.
Kristen specializes in strangeness. I ve spent thousands on psychiatirists.
They ve gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don t know what you want from me.
I m sorry to hear that, but you re the experts on this, not me. If I had any insights, believe me, I d share them with you.
Now if you ll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
The maid packed a suitcase. Teresa! Teresa?
Hi Mom.
I thought I d wait for you.
It s okay, I m not tired. Really.
He s full of shit.
Mom?
I thought I d wait for you.
Can t it wait till morning?
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
They re healing up nicely.
Watching TV.
Research.
Wait and see.
I gotta stay up, Max.
Don t fucking humor us. We re not in the mood.
I think new York was just what I needed. So many people. I never feel alone.
I don t know. I m busy with school. New friends. But I ll never forget the old ones.
Do you still... see each other?
When I was a little girl. Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I d bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better. He always used to tell me about it the next day he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
I was on the team at school. I was never very good, though.
You did it the other night.
They sedated me. We re stuck here till it wears off.
Can t be good news coming from you.
So?
What?
Those are ancient history.
Stay out of my face or I ll go straight to Max.
A little basic, but nice.
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Say listen, Doc. I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Fucked up chromosomes, man. Think about it. Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
It s been a long time.
I lost too much over this already. I m through with it.
You ll get to meet them all tomorrow. They re... survivors. In a way. All severely sleep disordered. Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
Right. They seem to share a group delusion, a " boogeyman " for lack of a better word. They re so traumatized, they ll do anything not to sleep.
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview. I don t know where he got the razor... but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
Ever work with vets? These kids act like they ve got D. S. S. Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn t know better, I d swear they d seen heavy combat.
So I ve been told. Practically an obsession of your.
Call me Nancy.
Didn t get much sleep.
Never been here before?
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn t saying much. your parents still live around here?
Sorry.
Sounds like a rough time.
I ve been to Pittsburgh. Does that count?
Okay... I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing... but if you re into UFO s or Atlantis, you ve lost me.
That s a new one. Is that what they re teaching now at Stanford?
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
With Hypnocyl?
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with. you have no business taking it yourself.
So do I.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Doesn t matter.
I m running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access. A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
For what?
Try me.
Remember open mind.
Don t you think I know that? I don t have any choice.
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
All right. Whoever she is, I ll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
Your dreams?
What about Kristen?
And what are they?
You can t! They ll be defenseless against their dreams.
How do we get in?
What are you talking about?
What?
A sad choice.
Mary Helena.
Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest. It is an abomination to God and Man.
Purgatory... fashioned by the hands of men. Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays. The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days. She was raped... hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive... and with child.
That girl was Amanda Krueger. Her child
Cooling down.
Frankly, I don t understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
I know what it is. I just can t believe what I m hearing. What has she talked you into?
I won t allow it.
For God s sake, Elizabeth... just try to help the kids, will you? Listen to them.
Uh, fourteen.
This is stupid.
In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
I m a vegetarian.
I m sorry? You think you deserve the brownie?
Now you re lying.
We have to. I ve got to be in New York on Thursday.
I m not listening.
' Tomorrow will be soon enough. '
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
I m an actress.
Well, they can be.
Films mainly.
Fifteen million dollars.
Really?
No, that s fine. I was going to steal one myself but now I ve changed my mind. Signed by the author, I see.
No thank you. I need to get my car back.
No thanks.
No.
Really, no.
No.
I forgot my bag.
Right. No one. I mean, I ll tell myself sometimes but... don t worry I won t believe it.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Oh Okay.
Yeh unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let s give it a try. Four o clock could be good.
Hello.
Ahm well we would have liked to but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
No, it s my fault, I thought this would all be over by now. I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing. I seriously don t know what got in to me. I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Oh well, great. Perfect. Oh no shittity brickitty it s my sister s birthday shit we re meant to be having dinner.
But no, I m sure I can get out of it.
You ll be my date at my little sister s birthday party?
I m sure it s all right. My friend Max is cooking and he s acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
It s the hair! It s to do with the hair.
It was an accident about eighteen months ago.
That s fine.
I thought you were leaving.
Let s go in.
You abide by rules like that?
What did you say?
Yes, you did.
There s no unless. No one has said " whoopsidaisies " for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
She left me.
She saw through me.
No, you were brilliant
I don t know, I m afraid.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn t.
You ve got to go.
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
I m sorry... I don t know what to say.
This is the place.
Don t think about it. We ll sort it out. Now what would you like tea... bath...?
No, that s fine. It s not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star. It was a thrill for me. How is he?
Well, there s a question without an interesting answer.
I appreciate that absolutely. Is that the film you re doing?
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Hand it over. Basic plot?
' No, turn over 4 TRS s and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT s return at 19 hundred then inform the Pentagon that we ll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12. 15 and don t you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I ll pelt you with olives.
' Thank you. How many mistake did I make?
Damn. And Wainwright... '
' Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I d be home for his birthday could you get a message through that I may be a little late. '
My son s name is Johnny?
Well, get a message through to him too.
What do you think?
You think I should do Henry James instead?
Yes I mean you never get anyone in Wings of a Dove having the nerve to say inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover. '
I do. It feels like how being in love should be. Floating through a dark blue sky.
Yes. Always have had.
No. What s that?
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
You have a stunt bottom?
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
It s one hell of a job. What do you put on your passport? Profession Mel Gibson s bottom.
The ice cream or Mel Gibson s bottom?
Well, thank you. Anyway time for bed. Or... sofa bed.
Okay.
You and every person in this country.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts how can you be so interested in them?
No seriously. I mean, they re just breasts. Every second person in the world has got them...
But... they re odd looking. They re for milk. Your mum s got them. You must have seen a thousand of them what s the fuss about?
Who was Gilda?
You re lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Stay forever.
Undressed like this, yes.
How do you think I m doing?
I know, I know but... just let s stay calm...
That s spectacularly unfair.
I mean today s newspapers will be lining tomorrow s waste paper bins.
Well, you know it s just one day. Today s papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Absolutely you re clearly very busy.
Okay.
Hello.
Yes I m sorry I had to leave... I didn t want to disturb you.
Fine. Everything much the same. When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately. Whereas you... I ve watched in wonder. Awards, glory...
Thank you. Shall I...
Okay well, thank you. I don t know what it s for. But thank you anyway.
... Yes, that s fine. Of course. I... you know... of course... I ll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
I see. That reality is a real no, isn t it?
I haven t decided.
Yes.
What s your name?
Well, that s the signature and above, it says Dear Rufus you belong in jail. '
Is that right?
I can t say I know Patrick all that well.
Miracles do happen.
He wouldn t say.
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Anna Scott?
The movie star?
... get fired.
He s cooking guinea fowl?
In a depressingly asexual way.
Oh no this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Yes sort of...
What?
Shame!
And we intend to use them!
No it s my 22nd.
Working with Leonardo.
Di Caprio.
Me?
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
Blimey. What s that?
Well, thanks, that s great.
How you doing? I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Oh great. Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
Still, not sparkling.
Unless it s illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don t want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
What s your name?
The others?
Yes?
Ah... yes, enormously.
Right, right. Ahm did you enjoy making the film?
Any bit in particular?
Shall I go get a cappuccino? Ease the pain.
Thanks. I don t think you ll believe who was just in here.
Topol.
But Ringo Starr doesn t look anything like Topol.
So it could have been neither of them?
Right. It s not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Martin, can t you just deal with this yourself?
Can you tell her I ll ring her back.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
No, it doesn t.
Definitely no comment.
Let s face facts. This was always a no go situation. Anna s a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Every time. But don t despair I think I have the solution to your problems.
That s not fair.
Yes I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months. I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
I believe I have.
No, don t think I do.
May I help you, sir?
I m sorry, we don t have anyone of that name here, sir.
How about Miss Flintstone?
Yes I was looking for Anna Scott...
No, no. She doesn t.
Oh right. I mean, I am a friend I m not a lunatic but no, you basically...
This is important in comparison to, let s say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
What are the choices?
Yes she might think you don t have true love on your mind.
Thanks. Great. Wish me luck.
It s not yogurt it s mayonnaise.
Ahm combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
So any messages?
Two? That s it?
Ahm let s see ahm. No. Gone completely. Oh no, wait. There was one from your mum: she said don t forget lunch and her leg s hurting again.
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi it s Anna and then she said, call me at the Ritz and then gave herself a completely different name.
What?
No, fraid not.
That s compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
You re welcome. Did you find them?
Aha! I d been getting a female vibe. Good. Speak on, dear friend.
I don t want to interfere, or anything... but she s split up from her boy friend, that s right isn t it?
And she s in your house.
And you get on very well.
Well, isn t this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Right. Right. You think it s the wrong moment. Fair enough. Do you mind if I have a go?
No you re right.
Why not?
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
I m going to throw out these old videos.
Right let s talk about rent...
Yes.
Fabulous.
Yes.
What?
So?
What book?
I haven t got a book down my trousers.
Okay what if I did have a book down my trousers?
Yes, that s perfectly correct.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
No, Miss Ratched...
Yes, that is correct.
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
Would you like to start?
Y y y yes...
I was in luh love with her.
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
I don t want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Billy, that girl couldn t have pulled you in there forcibly...
Who? Tell me!
Will you come with me, please.
Yes, ma am...
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell er where I am so she can come visit me.
Yes, ma am.
Just that I m glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
I wanna report a robbery!
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
What for?
Well, say. How bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
You sure run a tight assed ship round here, don t ya!
Right... I ve been givin some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding s problem.
Go on...
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
Jesus Christ, the man doesn t want to talk, so get off his back an let s get on to some new business.
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin on right now an that s therapy also!
Very well. What is it you re proposing, Mister McMurphy?
A vote is before the group.
I m sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
I m sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
Yes, ma am?
Thank you, ma am.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
H H Hearts.
B B Billy.

No.
Ca na da...
Yeah...
Ca na da...
It s okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Shit, Rose! What s there to decide? There s only four of us.
That okay. I ll take your marker. How many ya want?
Yeah, Mack?
Let me get on your shoulders.
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
Where ya goin, Mac?
They went that way.
A pecking party?
I m not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I m talkin about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
Tell er to go to hell anyway!
What for?
Lobotomy?
I don t see you scoring any points, buddy. And you re just the man for the job, right?
A baseball game isn t worth the risk, my friend.
You mean you re going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
With your own two hands?
Okay, Harding, you re on.
I know, goddammit! You don t have ta tell me that!
I m not talkin to him! I m talkin to myself! It helps me think!
What for?
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I refuse!
No!
I just started!
I don t trust you!
No!
No!
No!
Just wait till you hear...
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Yesterday...
Can you borrow me a dime?
What s this?
Hit me.
Yeah, Mac?
Yeah, it s cold!
He s not!
Why, I ll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
Oh, what was that?
I see.
In what way?
I see...
Yes... Ah, do you know why you re here?
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates. What do you think of that report?
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
The doctor at the prison states: Don t overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm... What do you say to that?
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
Well, you re here for a ninety day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I d like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I d like your cooperation!
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might ve put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what s been comin down in that loony bin.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I m disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That s all.
I m afraid not.
No, Mister McMurphy, it s just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
I m sorry, but I can t keep you here.
Time out!
' Kay, Mac!
' Kay, Mac!
' Kay!
Are you a doctor?
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
I m the next one.
Because I quit breathing.
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
What s going on?
Oh, yeah?
How much ya wanna bet?
He can t hear you. He s just a deaf and dumb Indian!
Yeah, what s up?
Prayin, brother. Prayin.
I tell ya, there s an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
Now, wouldn t you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an a piece of that angel cake?
Oh, yeah...
Hi ya, big boy? How s it goin? Like it in here?
He s in charge.
P. A. What the hell is that?
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he s over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
Big man!
On what?
What s that?
That!
Are they dangerous when they re awake?
I thought so.
He s dead.
That s what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
You ol fucker!
Oh, yeah...
Don t you sweet talk me you ol spook, you!
Yes, but... He was having an affair.
No, she wasn t my sister.
Of course not.
I I must ve misplaced it.
You don t understand. The man I m supposed to marry is on that plane.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago. He said his plans had changed unexpectedly. Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
Why?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
What for?
Really. She thinks he s here. Even though she s never met him. Even though she s never laid eyes on him.
No.
No.
She s been acting weird lately, though. I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about " communication ". Like I don t know how to communicate.
Your great aunt.
Oh no. Do you?
No...
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
Dwayne?
Ask her if she knows where he is?
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him? If she has a telephone number?
What s mezzaluna?
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he s... not what you think
But, Faith
But Faith
Hi there...
No, you gave a very convincing performance. And you ll be pleased to know that your eight by ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
Thanks.
Amazing.
Hm.
Dwayne Pinsley? I m trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Who s this?
My name s
I m at the airport. Why?
I m on my way to Venice. Why?
You said whatever it was you would understand.
I m in love with you.
I know I m limping. I stubbed my toe.
NO.
If it s any of your business, yes.
Yes.
He s safe.
Does he love you?
You didn t answer my question.
What?
Look, Peter, I don t hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking. We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
So it wasn t real.
Where s Positano?
Oh no, I don t think that would be a good idea.
Tell me.
Please. I need to know.
Mickey Spillane?
Right now?
Oh. That s nice.
Well, good. Good for you.
What?
What are you doing here?
I just wanted to keep an eye on you. The guy s a total stranger, remember?
Yeah.
Hi. Are you... busy?
I know the feeling.
You aren t?
Well. Congratulations.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
You want a hint? I ll give you a hint. You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine
What?
Who cares?! You hired an actor??
I can t believe you did that!
You re the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
Well, I might ve found him again if I hadn t left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
A " little white lie "? A " little white lie "?
Rational?! Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Gee, I m flattered. What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I ve decided to lie to her instead.
That s not the point. And what if I had wanted to?
Beautiful place...
Just since yesterday.
Tonight?
Well, not exactly...
Yes?
Oh, Faith. My name s Faith.
Really?
Nothing. Prices are a little steep here, aren t they?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
Oh, hello.
What?
No. He smokes.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
It s a metaphor. It s women who always think there s some unknown out there that s going to be better than what s in front of them. And instead wind up with nothing.
Yes. You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people s fantasies.
So, what s your point?
Is he married?
Is he gay?
So?...
I don t know, Kate.
No. He s never asked me.
Why should I ask someone out who I don t want to go out with in the first place?
Yes you did.
Look how big it makes me look. I look like an Alp.
Oh, I don t know. I guess it s just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be. You know, like in the movies.
I know. You re right.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
No... I can just tell.
It s a coincidence.
But it s July.
What about your job?
You don t have a passport.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Does Dwayne know about this?
You re just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
How hard can it be? I ll land there, I ll go to his hotel, I ll introduce myself, and
The book said they have boats that are like taxis... Vaporettos. What s the name of the place we re staying again?
" Gritty "? Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don t believe in deodorant?
What?
Are you sure?
You gave it your best shot. You tried.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
What d you find?
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
We re not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we re trying to locate him.
What is it?
Only what?
We would ve had enough gas to get us there if you hadn t gotten us lost. Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I m starting to see Larry s side of the story.
Well, you don t have to get snippy with me.
I don t know, Kate. I just said that. I m sorry. I m just on edge. I m afraid we re losing him.
' Course he does.
Larry bought himself cologne?
Her brother.
I don t know. I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden
Because I m the one who s single.
Sure you did.
Oh my God. Where?
Is he looking at us?
Faith. So far you ve trailed the man halfway around the globe. At this point, I don t think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
What?
Okay, here s what I think. We find out what all the subway stops for that train are the subway system s really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and
I meant about my idea.
Like a detective.
But how could he know? He only just met me.
Hi. Where ve you been?
Packing.
Because I ve been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning. This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
A little bad luck?
I know, but...
... and a fortune teller.
What about Peter?...
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind. May as well start packing, our cab s gonna be here in an hour.
What?
You sure you ll be okay?
What if he doesn t like me?
My God... you re right.
No one s perfect, Kate.
Yes. He is.
Yup.
Uh huh.
Actually, no. There s not going to be a wedding.
And Larry?...
He s gone. He told me what happened. He just left for the airport.
Kate.
No. Well, I don t know. Well, maybe. Later.
She s saying he s a a porco.
Giovanni, this is Faith s friend, Peter.
Oh.
You don t have to go if you don t want to...
Giovanni.
You miss me?...
No, why?
Right.
It s not exploitation. These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation? She takes one night class and suddenly she s a socialist.
We re all desperate for the money, doll. That s what made this country great. Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
You used to love it when I called you doll.
What? You know him?
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up? The guy never even existed?
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would ve thought she d spend her life waiting for this guy?
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and
She s not here.
She went out to check into skywriting. I can t believe you lied. Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
Good strategy.
Mania.
Thanks.
He just got a call from " Mr. Upstairs. " Something s gone wrong. He s plenty hot.
I d get over there, Terry. I ll take the little lady home.
Talk louder. I can t hear you.
If I talk too loud it s the fault of the nuns.
Sure we keep records!
We was robbed last night and we can t find no books.
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that  he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury. It softens em up.
I know what s eatin you, kid. But I got two thousand dues payin members in my local  that s seventy two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady  well, you figure it out. And that s just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out  we take our cut.
We ain t robbin pennies from beggars. We cuttin ourselves in for five six million a year just on our half a dozen piers  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor. But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
I m not thirsty.
So they re walking along and smiling. That doesn t mean he s going to talk. There s no evidence until he gives public testimony.
I ain t interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D n D or is he a canary?
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I m just another fellow down here.
Then don t.
That was the idea.
Maybe he gave them an argument.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
Why me, Charley? I d feel funny going in there.
But going in that church, I d be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
I ve got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese eater.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
They feel you ve been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it s time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
Sure, that s all right when you re a kid, but you ll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It s time you got some ambition.
Boss loader!
And for all that dough I don t do nothin?
Yeah  yeah  I guess I do  but there s a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
I don t know  I don t know! I tell you I ain t made up my mind yet. That s what I wanted to talk to you about.
I know. I know.
Don t say that!
Don t say that!
I could have been better!
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty seven River....
Charley.... Charley.... Wow....
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
Gee, when you tipped one seventy five you were beautiful. You should ve been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
Give it to me  my Pop s job 
None of your business.
Thanks. Steel pipes and baseball bats.
Which side are you with?
I ll get home all right now.
Everybody knew him. He got around.
Aah, he s a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
You training to be a nun or something?
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
A teacher! Dong!!! You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He s very brainy. Very.
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in 
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were 
Man, you were a mess!
The thought I m tryin to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
Now you got me! It s a wonder I wasn t punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with! They thought they could beat an education into me  I foxed em.
How would you ve done it?
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
What what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
Do you like pigeons?
I only live up there and across the roof.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
I don t know.
You don t mind yourself at all, do you. Joey used to race pigeons.
That was nice of you.
I wouldn t have thought you d be so interested  in pigeons.
The things that go on.
Even pigeons aren t peaceful.
I don t know.
In a saloon?
How do you like it?
How about another one?
I went pretty good for a while, didn t I, Al? But  I didn t stay in shape  and   I had to take a few dives.
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you re nowhere. Miss Four Corners.
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed  never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place  they called it a Children s Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and  But what am I runnin off at the mouth for? What do you care?
What a fruitcake you are!
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts! You really believe that drool?
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
I m not lookin to get crucified. I m lookin to stay in one piece.
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
Listen  get this straight  don t look at me when you say them things. It wasn t my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn t my idea....
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn t like the way he kept lookin at me.
Yeah, yeah.... This Father Barry, what s his racket?
You ve been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody s got a racket.
Edie, down here it s every man for himself. It s keepin alive! It s standin in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin in your pocket.
If you don t Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You ll never have no trouble down here.
All right, all right.. I shouldn t ve asked you.
I don t want it. But why don t you stay and finish your drink.
What for?
Why worry about me? You re the one who says only look out for yourself.
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
I can t let myself fall in love with you.
I won t eat cheese for no cops, that s for sure.
Look out for number one. Always number one. I should ve known you wouldn t tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you. No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
I m tryin to keep you from being hurt  What more do you want?
I  I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey s. Yours is coming out at the elbows.
Terry, what s wrong?
You?
Who says?
I just told the Father.
What I did to Joey.
What I did to Joey.
Lucky Pop isn t home, he d kill you.
I don t want to talk about it. I want you to go.
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it s a lie. It s like there were two different people inside of you. You ve got to be one or the other.
It s you who s being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it s got to come out.
I don t want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
It s just a scratch. You won t die. She turns away from him.
Get away from me.
I didn t say I didn t love you. I said stay away from me.
I don t want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it s safe to walk the streets without....
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Get out of my way.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Well, it s over.
He s going to have to grow up too.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I ll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront ll be safe for you now. Maybe inland  the Middle West somewhere  a job on a farm....
Pop, I m not ready to go back yet.
Who is he, Pop?
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
He tries to act tough, but there s a look in his eyes that....
He wasn t Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian....
He wanted to see me again.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
You are like 
What about it?
O. K. O. K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
We re getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
What?
I told you I don t know nothin and I ain t saying nothin.
Wilson  yeah  yeah  I fought Wilson.
You want to know something  I would have taken Wilson 
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him  boy, I was ready that night.
Such as what?
I m just resting my feet.
I ll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher  hooks  over n under   whop whop!
You ll work.
Raise a hand to me and....
I told you lay off.
' s all right, kid. I took care of em myself this morning.
Looking for me?
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody.... You think I should turn him in?
Yeah, I m kidding, I m kidding. You don t think I should turn him in....
Yeah  us Golden Warriors. You re a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
No.
Take it easy now, Terry.
Hit me again.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
I ll bring him up to your loft.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss.
Forty five bills.
So so, Johnny.
Aw, you know I don t like to count, Johnny.
Not a dent. Perfect
Thirty six  sev  aah I lost the count.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don t want it, I 
Aw, Johnny....
Nothing happened, Johnny.
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn t know much.
How d you get that.
Listen, Johnny 
You want to know somethin ?
Go on talkin. You re talkin yourself right into the river. Go on, go on....
You ratted on us, Terry.
Go on, beat it!
Don t give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
Coffee, that s a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
I can t believe it  a small fortune. You can t buy me  you re still a bum! Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey.
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you re a walkin distillery.
Keep Charley out of this.
Go ask him, why don t you? Ask him yourself.
What are you down here for  to see we don t make off with any of Mister Friendly s precious cargo?
Fiend is it! You will not be so fortunate. Your existence will cease within moments. No one wishes to see a man dance... And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
.. Oh, You could do nothing! I can save you much pain.
No. It s on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
You wouldn t understand. Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
Sure there are and I ve tried them all. Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories. Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about
That s life. My kisses are alive.
Well, fact or not, I don t see how we re going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight. I can t see a thing! Let s turn back.
Where?
It frightens me.
Then.. then what s that music?
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
I m not sure I care to find out what it is.
What help will that do if something in there isn t dead?
I can t imagine anything dead playing that music.
It s an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them. Nothing alive looks like that!
I m not sure...
You ve got a right to be. We re trapped by a bunch of fiends.
Don t let them hear you.
I m afraid I ll faint.
Be careful!
Nothing is worth your life.
I m frightened. I m so frightened.
Be careful, oh please be careful. We ll never get out of here alive, I know it. I just feel it.
Yes I feel it in my bones.
Oh, no I m not. These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
I should hope not. I hate you!
Yes, that sudden. If it weren t for you we wouldn t be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this. It s all your fault.
What can we do against them?
I still don t know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this. At least he s got brains.
There s nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
Yes, Master.
You know better than that.
Then why do you shake so?
Well rest easy, I m not angry with either of you.
Ahh, good. Then I will see them. Dismiss the rest.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward. It could be that you are that reward.
Till it s not funny any more. What do you want, Jack?
Didn t you tell me one time calls aren t monitored?
So why don t you come right out and tell me what you re talking about?
What s free about it? I m looking for work.
Emil the Amazing. The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I m working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes. How s this sound
And the one driving the other car?
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two. He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
Yeah, that s him. Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
Yes, it is.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
They didn t tell me anything, they asked questions.
You mean, did he try to jump me? No, but he was kind of talkative.
He didn t want me to.
I don t know. He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years. Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
He d call every once in a while.
He did? I don t remember. Did he say about me? In the trunk?
Huh. Problem is, Jack s idea of a normal life is robbing banks. It s all he s ever done.
Till they got busted.
That s the turnpike up there. Glenn s waiting with the other car.
How bout the score was his idea to begin with?
I want to talk to her again, that s all. See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
There s some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
There s something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person. It s not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean? There s just something about the heat and the wet that s calming you know? Settles me in a way that I really can t articulate.
There s a store around the corner, I ll be right back.
I wasn t feeling my best that day. I d just drawn thirty to life.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
He s running for his life, he doesn t give a shit about you.
We were talking one time, drinking rum. I may ve mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician. Chino got interested. He s like, Yeah? How does he saw the woman in half? He wanted to meet her. Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
Her phone s probably tapped.
I m a tourist.
Sure looks that way.
I been thinkin, if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
Doesn t say what she s doing up here, but I don t think it has anything to do with us.
They don t stay the night, Jack, less you pay for it.
Just hung up.
Two hours.
Forty five minutes.
Forget about my sister. If Karen Sisco s tailing Glenn, we re fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Jesus, look at that wall. Place almost looks like a prison.
Time comes, we knock on the door. See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
Who says anybody s gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop s big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys alone.
Tell me something, Buddy. You know anyone who s actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life? Cause it occurred to me that everyone talks about doing it, but I don t know anyone who s actually gone and done it. Do you?
Let fate decide? What re you, the fuckin Dali Lama now?
Yeah, it s called Glades Correctional Institution and I m sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
Yes, she did.
You know how I felt about her.
It wasn t about getting laid. I just wanted to know what might ve happened if things were different.
I get that feeling, yeah.
Half for doing what?
I don t ski.
You remember Buddy, don t you, Richard?
Shit.
They re gonna rape the maid, aren t they.
And then they ll kill em.
Jack
That s nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now. Instead, let s talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel where was this?
Really? Huh. He told me he didn t remember how many he robbed.
In the trunk, yeah?
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
It was an unusual experience.
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn t know he robbed banks.
And what happened to Carl?
Is that what you would ve done?
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud? Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Have you ever shot a man? How many times have you been primary through the door?
You ll have to ask him.
Karen. Where are you? I been trying to get a hold of you.
Where are you? I been trying to reach you.
What we already talked to her. That s a dead end.
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there. We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale. I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i. d. him as the other guy. If he does, you call me right away...
But don t you do anything. You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Now. What is it you wanted to tell me?
What? Is that what you re calling me about?
Yeah, sure, Karen. You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
You re gonna use a ram?
What? Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
Call and tell you.
Wait. You not Adele?
You wouldn t shoot me, would you?
I could walk out of here.
Oh, is that right? You going to shoot me? Nice girl like you? I don t think so.
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Why you think is today?
How are you, Raymond?
Yeah. And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Yeah, Eddie was a real character. Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
I report to the FBI, first thing they re gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
No, I didn t know that.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn t make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities if you can believe that.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
I ll need a last known address.
We re a few minutes away. Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
There a problem, Foley?
Company, shit. I watch the man s back.
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper. Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Just like it. Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy. Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
Let s go outside and talk.
We re leaving.
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
Break and enter, shit. Take it and git, how it s done. Don t waste any time. That s how you do it.
That s a wonderful story, Snoop. I m very excited about tonight.
Not until recently.
A little.
If I could have a little more room.
For your breath. You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
I believe it. You ve ruined a nine hundred dollar suit my dad gave me.
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
You wouldn t have time anyway. We come to a roadblock, they ll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
Buddy. That s his given name?
Jack Foley. You ve probably heard of me.
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I d robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
Tell you the truth, I don t know. I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus. They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
I thought so, too.
I believe you would have. Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc. And I don t mean the place next door where some of Nixon s people went.
Basically. Yeah. If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
Of course I am.
What do you want me to do? Scream? I don t think it would help much. I m just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
You were married? All those falls, I m surprised you had time.
Uh huh.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it ll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
I don t recall his hat, but I ve seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers. Did you know he didn t have his shoes on?
They put a hundred and eighty seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving. Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
Faye Dunaway.
Network. Yeah, she was good.
Peter Finch.
Bleeding on a country road.
Nothing.
You d probably tell me.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
Really.
Who was it answered the phone?
I m just worried maybe I m not old enough for you.
Really. He has a cop s face.
And your gun.
How do we do that?
You won t do that.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip and fall and whiplash cheaters.
Why? You think he might tell you where I am?
He s dead. He did twenty seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he d missed. That s not gonna be me.
I m partial to mountains myself. But if you like islands, we ll make it an island.
I can go to the bar.
Those guys bother you?
Love it.
I m a sales rep. I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I m a girl.
What, as a sales rep?
I don t have a problem with it.
I had one just like it well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
It smelled.
No. What do you do for a living, Gary?
I don t think it works if we re somebody else. You know what I mean? Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
It s not a game. Something you play.
It doesn t have to, it s something that happens. It s like seeing a person you never saw before you could be passing on the street you look at each other and for a few seconds, there s a kind of recognition. Like you both know something. But then the next moment the person s gone, and it s too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, " What if I had stopped and said something? " It might happen only a few times in your life.
I called your room from downstairs.
Well, I d say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you d like to meet for a drink.
She did, huh.
You believe that?
I don t know. I hadn t worked that part out yet. All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn t want to leave you there, never see you again.
I couldn t believe it. I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet. Like if we could take a time out...
Where?
To warn her about Chino.
I don t think we should get into that.
Why are you mad?
What about my motive? Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal. You think I will?
I m trying not to. I just wanna know what s gonna happen.
Pretend I m somebody else.
What re you now, a desperado? Put the guns down.
You just did, for Christ sake.
Who you talkin to, Studs? Me, or Buddy. I can t tell, you got those shades on.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
My point is, that s probably what you re gonna end up with.
Studs. Man, I haven t heard that since Lompoc. What s going on?
I see better with them on.
You re in civilization now, man, ease up.
In the trunk?
How many?
Okay. How many going out?
When?
You know who they are?
Really? Well, I uhhh...
I don t know. I never used a gun.
You d be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
No? Where do you keep it, Dick? I m talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
You re the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn. Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Of course not.
Doesn t have to figure out shit. You told him you keep em at your house.
Twenty two months, three days, two hours. Why?
Hey, Jack? Bullshit. I didn t make my first million until I was forty two. Forty two. You really want to change, it s never too late.
Who is? But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work. You gotta look at it as peace of mind. As security, you know what I mean? I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
No need to decide now. Be like the fish. Let whatever happens happen.
Yeah, fish live in the present. They don t dwell on yesterday and they don t worry about tomorrow. Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there s no neurosis involved. No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish shrink s couch. They just do it. They accept.
The fish saved my life. Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure. So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
It works. You should try it sometime.
What s to think about?
How, Dick? The way you earned it? By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her? What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit? Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks. You were a goddamn dumpling. Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing. Till you were nothing. I saved your ass. So you ll pardon me if I don t wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying " sign in here please " or " hey, pal, you can t park there. " Okay, Dick? I can t do it.
How are you, Richard?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
You gonna write me a check?
I m not leaving Midge.
Islamic.
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
For a time.
Meaning time came, I left.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
That time?
Yeah. That was the ninth.
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
Hejira.
Apparently, yeah. I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Like what?
It couldn t have been out at Glades, if that s what you re thinking. I was never out there.
I remember you now. Shit.
We re not. I m helping him, yeah
What am I supposed to do now?
Jesus, I don t believe it.
You re not?
The two guys you were with that one, that isn t Maurice Miller, is it? I ve seen Snoopy s mug shot and that didn t look like him.
You re gonna bust me for picking up a car?
Listen, these guys, they re gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They re fucking animals.
Nothing. I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Rippin off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they re into shit I can t handle.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills. Now, I don t give a shit what they do.
He s supposed to be, but he hasn t shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
I don t know he doesn t exactly confide in me.
I m freezing my ass off.
Really?
I know, you ll find me. Jesus, I believe it. I keep thinking if you hadn t driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn t even know who I am.
You crazy, come up here? It s fuckin one degree outside.
Uh huh.
Some one? Gimme a hint.
Gimme another hint.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won t think anything of it.
I ll show you, soon as I get one more guy I m gonna need, Moselle s brother, Kenneth. Along with White Boy there.
Me?
Can I do what?
What when?
I don t have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is my job. You re either in or you re not. You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that s your problem, not mine.
I think you re forgetting, this is my car. I drove it up here.
Why d he have to do that to that girl?
No. You gonna stay close to me from now on. So you don t disappear on me.
You look great. Your dad taking good care of you?
Oh...
How you know that?
Light to super middleweight, as my body developed. You go about what, bantam?
You know your divisions. You like the fights? Like the rough stuff? Yeah, I bet you do. Like to get down and tussle a little bit? Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle. I say to her, " You a good dog, Tuffy, here s a treat for you. " And I give Tuffy what every dog love best. You know what that is? A bone. I can give you a bone, too, girl.
Don t matter. I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
What do you want?
You not with probation, one of those?
You a lawyer?
He said he stayed here last November.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Your dog was killed?
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
It s a
Happy birthday, kid. You want another Coke?
Which one is that? The ATF guy?
He s still married though, huh?
Oh, he s moved out?
Then they re not separated, are they?
What re you doing at Glades?
You know you can always step in, work with me full time as one of my investigators.
You used to like it.
You d meet doctors, lawyers nothing wrong with them necessarily if they re divorced. Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife? That s the way those hotshots are, all of em.
We don t get to talk much any more.
What d I say?
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
No?
He s pretty laid back, confident.
Not at all.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
My married boyfriend setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity. I couldn t believe it.
Foley kid napped me.
I couldn t swear to it, but I m pretty sure he did.
I didn t have time.
So?
He doesn t seem to hold a grudge. What I want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long? Any thoughts on that one?
It s possible. Why?
He knew what he was doing. Nobody forced him to rob banks.
I told you, he isn t here.
He s in Florida. Palm Beach.
I don t have any idea.
I spoke to her. The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
Not so fast, Dick. Starting now, there s gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn  Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Well, I need that...
Are those my suits?
Forget about her. Tell me where the money s at.
That s your line for tonight, ya know.
You mean hiding them?
He was that good?
Red... Strange?
But... they called you Strange? Because of Red Grange? I don t get it. Was Red Grange strange?
Only when I m n n n
Yes Sir.
You liked that?
Sir?
Hale what?
Sir, I
Where s that lizard?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
A m missionary?
Well, you p puked on his feet.
Good shooting, Rafe!
Home of the brave!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
I m sorry, Danny, but they re only accepting the best pilots.
I have to talk to Evelyn. And I want you to meet her.
Yeah.
Upset? Why should I be upset?
Why be sorry? That s what you feel, it s better to come out with it.
Sure you did. So come on. Say what you think.
You don t wanna put beer over mai tai.
What facts are those?
I was grieving too.
So what are you saying?
You left her. How s that for a fact?
Fuck you.
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
Yeah. So you can call me if you need help.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
No. You re trying to beat me.
They ll turn the ship into the wind before we launch. That ll help.
We ll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China. I m on your wing.
I can t make it.
The brass is afraid of sabotage. This makes em easier to protect and easier to service.
Who s gonna to that? Japan is four thousand miles away. So you guys just arrived, huh?
He told me about you. That he had no other friend like you.
You were more like brothers.
He said you re the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it s quiet. Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes. Do you think that s why we re meeting. To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
He told me he didn t want to leave me with regret. Now that s all I have.
Well... sure.
We won t have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they ll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we re airborne.
I d don t think Japs ought a be allowed to p play baseball.
Colonel, to f fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice. And to practice it, ya gotta play
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
Never, Sir. I just meant it s dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit. And all you ve done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks. To honor you, Sir. What the French call a " homage. "
We can explain, Colonel.
You re just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you re volunteering for a mission I ve been ordered to put together. Do you know what top secret is?
Bombers.
Colonel... we re all going. Whether you make it or not.
Our doctor s gone too.
Boxin.
Dorie Miller, Mam.
Every other Sunday. I m heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
Tell me something, Dorie. A man as big as you and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn t help do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
No, he... got some news today. He ll be okay, he just didn t feel like coming tonight.
The only reason it s hard to say is that I keep thinking I don t have the right to say it. But I ve got to because it s true. I love you. That must surprise you.
We re all going away.
But you re in the U. S. Army, how could you
You waited til tonight to tell me?
I don t know if you can choose that, Rafe.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
How did you?...
I m just... so amazed, so glad to know that you re okay. You are okay, aren t you?
It s not your fault, Rafe. The letter I wrote you, they
I need to tell you something. I didn t know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven t lived and loved enough. I didn t understand. Forgive me.
Of course I forgive you. I know what you feel for Danny is real. And your choice is your choice.
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along. I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
Brilliant, Admiral.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system s shorting out in the cockpit.
And if you don t give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
Learn English, then!
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans. No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover. In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
I m not telling.
Well, I like to speculate. This book I m reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
That never changes. You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family s gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma. Has it ever worked before?
How do you like my hair?
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He s missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Borrow?! This was my dress. Maybe it s a mistake. What if I m the only one? I don t even want to go. Everybody s just going to say... Hi.. Where s Crazy Charlie?
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
I don t know how you do it. I ve never even dated anybody but Charlie.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
It s not the place. I don t buy that. Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
Oh, it s not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business. Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I d sure do things a lot differently.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
I can t. It s all too much.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
Yeah. You re so lucky. He really loves you, too. He s always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
Just what you underlined.
It s that jerk Walter.
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don t have a boyfriend anymore.
That s disgusting!
Charlie...
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I m still paying for it.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
I know. Put Scott through college.
Charlie! Am I dead?
I call this the staccato.
Oh yeah?
Refresh my memory.
Maybe I blocked it out.
Why wait?
Would you?
Thanks.
I thought it had a lot of merit.
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Great, isn t it?
Hey! What s the fun of being a teenager if you can t dress weird? And we re going to have fun tonight, right?
Is this slow enough for you?
I m fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
Hey! Who needs physics when we ve got chemistry?
You re pretty charming when you want to be.
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight. And the tide rushes in.
You know I do. I even wrote you into my will.
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse? You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
But you re the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Forget it. I ve been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad s right. Teenagers are nuts.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
What am I going to do with you?
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn t feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
Charlie,. I ve been trying to postpone this. But what s the point? It s over. I don t want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I m doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
That won t make any difference. We just can t live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
I just can t trust you anymore.
That s just it. You can always get to me. There s this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing s ever going to be different!
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you ll go to college. And finish.
I m trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I m going to... Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
Sorry, the Blue Thunder s out of commission for a while.
How d you know about that?
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
That s real big of you.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
What?
You re crazy! You re really out of your mind!
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
I ve got to go now.
I ll love you, too, Charlie. I ll love you for twenty years.
Charlie? Was I dead?
You look awful, like you haven t slept in days. And so old.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
What about Janet?
Oh, God, Dion.
I ll never give up.
Don t try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you d find that out.
Dolores, can t you be a little kinder to people? You don t even know the boy. If you weren t so neurotic and insecure, maybe you d shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
Take a long walk on a short pier.
Okay.
That commie beatnik? What s she doing with him? Wait ll I tell Charlie.
I wish she hadn t.
But I m remembering the future.
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We d all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It ll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn t look like the barbecue type.
Gilfond s okay, except he thinks Hemingway s great Literature.
He s a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he s the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk...
What re you doing here anyway?
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Yeah. I m surprised. It s really old... Travels well though. You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
What are you shooting for?
Don t you get along with your parents?
They care about you. They re just a different generation.
Is that one of your poems?
I d love to.
For everyone.
Utah? I thought you d be going to New York or Paris. What s in Utah?
I can t do that.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
That s a terrific line. You re going to be a wonderful writer.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you ll remember and write about it.
What?
I m just happy to see you.
I m sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Let s do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn t he dreamy? I wish he d break up with Arlene. She thinks she s so great.
Why not? They re my favorite.
I think you should give up diving. It s dangerous.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn t tell you before, I didn t know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
But accidents can happen.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn t recognize you.
Where s Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
Well, you showed them. You re rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
What was?
You re a sweet man, Richard.
I m not doing any tutoring this year. I m too busy.
I m writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
Are you doing some kind of science project?
What s that?
I know what a burrito is.
What s inside?
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Listen, you ve gotta keep this a secret. You can t tell a soul. Promise?
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I ve returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
How, did you know about my grandfather?
That s why I was getting a divorce.. What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
Come on, Richard, I m serious.
Am I dead or not?
I told you, I ve already lived my life. I don t know how or why I m here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
I m trying. I ll see you tomorrow.
I m just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn t listen to me.
Richard, take it easy.
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don t you wonder if there s going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Give me some credit, will you?
Wbat re you talking about?
Come on. You can t be serious.
Are you talking  about exercise? Like gym?
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV s.
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?
That s what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
That s terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn t I think o  that before?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that ll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Peggy Sue Kelcher. Or, Peggy Bodell. I m not sure.
Ah..... they re very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
I think it s called silicon. Charlie told me that.
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn t have blamed me. We were just too young.
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
I couldn t help it   I loved him.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn t understand the rest.
It s all, gone wrong, nothing s working out.
Goodbye? Where re you going? What about our partnership? I m making real progress with the microchip.
So are you. You ve got a vision.
Did you break up with Charlie?
Okay. Why don t we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
Wait! I ll go with you!
The Creed cat, that s right. Bastard s name was " Church ". Let me guess. Your dog s tissue isn t healing, pupils aren t dilating... maybe you can t find a heartbeat?
I don t know what you expected to find, Matthews. There s nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
Yes... why?
He s probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids ve been going out there on Halloween night for years.
I had a little run in with Zowie.
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don t ever think that we didn t.
" Out. " Well that s great, Geoff. Look, I ve been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I m not going to stand for crap like this. I don t care if it s Halloween... it s a school night, and if you do this again...
He pissed me off.
You shouldn t ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
I m not burying him here...
What did?
What if it s not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...... he ll come back alive.
What do you mean?
I don t know...... maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Good. He said he d be over for dinner at eight... I mean... he misses you, Mom...
In a word, Bob...
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
I don t know what to do, Bob.
Bob...
What s wrong with my face? You want to know what s wrong with my face? I ve got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
K R O one.
What s that on your forehead, pal?
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
You re going to the office?!
One hour!
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
I said, skip it, Michael. It s my treatment.
Fuck you. This shit s probably not doing me any good anyway.
Close the law book.
The least you can do is look at me, while I m sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
That s not what I said.
No.
Maybe you should think about it.
Maybe you should think about it.
That s right. We re on the Positive Plan. You don t have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
Then, what are we, Drew?! The winners? " Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel... " Excuse me, I m not your lover. I m your Care Partner. FUCK!
Ready for what, baby?
If you d lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
About my blood work?
Defined by Webster s as harmless.
It s okay. Can I sit down?
One week old.
Little baby girl.
Thanks, Beckett. I m real excited about it. What can I do for you?
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
Continue.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Continue.
We?
Your... lover?
Continue.
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They re frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it s the homo angle. Maybe they don t want to rub elbows with someone who s just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
They sabotaged me.
Look. I know I have a case. If you don t want to take it for personal reasons...
Beckett? I m sorry about... what s happened to you. It s a fucking kick in the head.
What?
I m a lawyer. How s your baby?
What s her name?
They didn t fire her?
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
We re friends of Beckett s.
Not bad.
Beer. We need to go over your Q and A.
Sure. It s fine.
Correct.
Let me tell you something, okay? When you re brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there s not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you re taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they re a danger to kids, they re afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
Uh huh...
Charles. Okay. Miller?
What have you prayed for?
There s a possibility I won t be around for the end of this trial.
What happens?
I ve made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it s not your area...
Want to hear my favorite aria?
What impressed you about him?
What kind of person is that?
It s possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn t diagnosed until several years later.
I suppose you could say that.
I still am.
No. I didn t.
I m an excellent lawyer.
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It s the only thing I ve ever wanted to do.
Yes. On my torso.
Yes.
What?
I m late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o clock! If it s late, there s no case... Every problem has a solution.
Something like that.
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
Not unnecessary ones.
Gay movies.
Yes.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
It s impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
That happened once. People weren t talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
No.
That is not correct. I never lied about it.
No.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one s sexuality, is that right?
You could have infected him, isn t that right?
Really?
That s right.
Absolutely.
Answer the question, please.
I m fine.
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug. Andrew, stop!... He still doesn t listen.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don t expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Yes.
Yes. I m now in charge of the paralegal department.
Is that a question?
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler s secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
What did you say?
That s correct.
That s correct.
We won.
I might.
In a word, yes.
But he s got lots of other people s lives to ruin...
What kind of people?
Second.
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer. I don t pick up people in drug stores every day.
Aren t you?
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try? Asshole.
How many do you know?
Who?
Duh...
Probably since she was born.
Okay, Joe...
Fine, Joe.
That s perfectly clear.
Is there some kind of expression I ve picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I ve unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo vibe?!
Yeah...?
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god given, hormonal instincts... Anything going on?
How did you do that?
Yes, we did.
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
But didn t you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
Jesus.
Charles...
Bob. You re trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, " I m sick. I might not be able to see this through? "
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy. What, Bob?
Charles...
... But now, we re standing up for ourselves...
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin away when this whole thing started. Where you goin?
Okay, it was me. What d I do now?
What re they doing? What re we
' Mean the whispers?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him " doctor. "
Fairly fuckin ironic, wouldn t you say? Slamlight s so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up then you wind up here. Three ass kick suns. Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma am, not this time.
They re coming.
I got the quick and ugly version.
Entered our minds.
Had it with deals.
We can, can t we? Trust you?
Get out of our way.
One or two.
You sure you can keep
Think you ve mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
Confusin me with Johns now fear was his monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don t see.
You re fuckin with me. I know you are.
I can t.... I can t....
Don t do this to me....
But they... they could still be....
I would try for them.
Like the light is scalding it.
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
Not sure. Ten?
Possibly.
Can we switch?
Hey, who?
Big Evil?
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max slam facility on
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Promise me. Swear to me you won t
What?
Like what?
Sir Shiv a lot. He likes to cut.
Let s just be sure.
We re gonna find the body, Johns. Christ, you re a cop. Why am I tellin you this? We gotta go down and find it.
Thought you didn t believe his story.
Hey. Bein ballsy with your life now doesn t change what came before it s just stupid.
You said it, not me. Let s just not let one bad call lead to another.
How many?
60 years ago.
Let s wait on the power cells.
We re not sure when it happens, so let s not
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run fore I tracked him down.
May ve noticed chains don t work on this guy. Only way we re truly safe is if he believes he s goin free. But if he stops believin '
I never said I was.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you born lucky?
You made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule team.
Oh, don t use her like that, for a smoke screen.
For your own fear.
What the hell s it matter?
79 kilos.
We re just burnin light here.
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let s just go back to the ship.
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to
She tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us
Tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right we are disposable. We re just walking ghosts to her.
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
What, you re goin off, too?
He s dead. Cap n s dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when
You hear me? Captain s dead. Owens too.
Can t get my nose down... too much load back there....
Company s not here, is it?
You know who Muhammad was?
" Some prophet guy. " And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert where there was quiet to hear the words of God.
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
And you re certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
What?
I would rather we all stay
Which half?
Blessing you like the others. It s painless.
I see. Well, even if you don t believe in God, it doesn t mean He won t be
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim types?
Say that again.
For what? The honor of goin back to some asshole of a cell?
Well, you got the big gauge.
I m willing to take a cut in pay.
Said " looks clear. "
Not if I m the one.
Kept calling it " murder " when I did it.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
Nice embellishment.
So which one caught your eye?
What, you spect me to do it?
Just wonderin if we don t need a bigger piece of chum.
Blow dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very very rare, since the tribe s extinct.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don t know.
What, it s broken?
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
We ve never meant to be treasonable, sir. But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Don t speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll? And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him. '
Do you have any weapons?
You still don t believe me, do you?
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
Taylor, you re not in command here. Put down that gun.
What are you doing there?
No.
What s so special about him?
Remembers what?
Dear, you re a scientist. Don t you believe your own eyes?
I don t. And I m not going to try.
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
It s probably wrong
The evidence was very meager
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren t worth their parchment.
No, thank you. I won t get into that battle.
Yo!
Yo!
But how long is a day?
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
That way.
What do you mean, made it? I m an animal psychologist, that s all. We don t have any authority.
That s because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
Good morning, Julius. How s our patient today?
Huh?
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
He s vicious, Doctor. Besides, it s against the rules.
What signal?
Sorry... I was thinking of Stewart. What d you suppose happened?
You don t seem very cut up about it.
Then we ve been away from Earth for eighteen months.
Long pause  You know it.
Prove it. If we can t get back, it s still just a theory.
There s only one reality left. We re here and it s now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Climb off me, will you!
Taylor. I m telling you
Don t bother
But I m not prepared to die.
So you can talk. I m Dr. Zira s nephew. This abduction was her idea. You re not really going to the zoo. That s just our cover story in case we re stopped. Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property
Zira doesn t want your female.
If you insist. But I m not taking any orders
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
Disillusioned... But vindicated! I ve been right all along. You can t trust the older generation. It s a matter of values
What is it?
I think you re making a mistake.
What?
He wouldn t leave her.
The Hunt Club.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
Why special?
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Mind your tongue, madame.
Read it yourself.
With one of them.
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State... Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius. And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for... final disposition. Do you know what that means?
I told the truth at that hearing of yours.
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
What about it?
I take it you don t believe the prosecutor s charge that I m a monster created by Dr. Zira.
That s exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You re talking heresy, doctor.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Then you admit
Thank you for calling me Taylor. Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
I don t know.
I m not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don t tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past will you exonerate them?
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Because you are a man. And you were right I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him even himself.
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
My name isn t Bright Eyes It s Taylor!
Shhhh!
Which one?
No, I swear I never saw this man before.
Yes.
Maybe not.
Taylor, please
Why not?
We can t.
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Like you, I find it difficult.
This is his assertion.
He doesn t know.
But there s the doll, sir.
He s dead! Where?... You saw him?
How the hell did he get away?
Stay out of this Elias. This ain t your show.
Says he can t walk.
Yeah, what is it?
I can t do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that...
I m talking to you Red and I m telling you no. Get back to your position.
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin how dey losin der ho s and how dey ain t got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
Das right dude. You be tryin to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time s be coming, my man, when de black man s gonna throw off that yoke.
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Youse so fucked up man.
Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you d probably kill it.
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
What?
Where s Elias come from?
I got one...
Then what do you suggest big shot?
You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. Lias didn t ask you to fight his battles and if there s a Heaven and god, I hope so I know he s sitting up there drunk as a fuckin monkey and smokin shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa!
Hey take it easy man. They re scared.
Yeah. How bout you?
Yeah.
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
... don t feel like it either.
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there s no right or wrong in them, they re just there.
Barnes believes in what he s doing.
In 65 yeah. Now... No. What happened today s just the beginning. We re gonna lose this war...
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you re gonna die?
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
I volunteered.
Nah...
What are the heads?
... there s nobody.
Y ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can t get out of it?
Not just me... it s the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don t add up to dry shit.
Politics man, fuckin politics. That O Neill man got his nose so far up Top s ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin s gonna be good...
They don t know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
Hey O Neill why don t you cool it, you don t have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Why the fuck didn t you do something Lieutenant!
You know what I m talking about!
Found it. Growing in a garden.
Jackson, looks like you got Elias squad now.
These two holes are yours...
I don t want to hear your problems, Jackson. You ll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
I don t want to hear about it Jackson.
That s right. I don t want to hear about it cause to tell you the truth, I don t give a shit okay... I just don t give a shit anymore.
How far does this train go?
Perhaps I don t take it so lightly.
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
Well..
I really don t know.
I don t know.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
Thank you.
I m supposing.
Yes?

Not tonight.
I m not in the mood for dining and dancing.
I m sure you have.
I haven t been invited.
Perhaps I d better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You ve been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I m grateful. But I don t think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
Would you mind?
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
How careful should I be?
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
How long would that take?
Immigration Officer?
I m Miss Mayfield. Is Mr. Campbell here?
Bank?
No, please.
I see.
I don t need it that badly. I don t enjoy crashing other people s parties.
What did you say his name was?
You don t sound as if you liked him very much.
As I said before...
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
No. Are you really going to drink that stuff?
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I d like a dry Martini myself.
Whatever you say.
I don t know you and you don t know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I m sure you d rather be alone.
Do you think I don t?
You re sure Mr. Brandon won t mind?
Much too late.
What s funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
He got in here how?
I don t.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
There wasn t any plane.
Bad enough.
Quarter after one. Why?
So there is. You don t want to go to bed. I don t want to go to bed. Let s go somewhere and hear some music have something to drink something to eat even dance.
Let s not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
Just who are you, anyway?
Is this the best you can do?
Dance? Here?
They know you here know your name.
I didn t notice him.
Killaine s not that sort of guy. He said no he meant no.
Couldn t be.
Absolutely sure.
You don t know who he is?
He was following us but he s not a policeman.
All right following me.
No matter. There s nothing I can do about it.
Take me home and forget you ever saw me. That s a silly remark isn t it?
Nothing matters.
So have I.
I m in the Hudson Bay Company s store. That man last night the one that followed me
There s another man right outside the booth here. I never saw him Before.
No percentage in that.
I know. Killaine has a warrant.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store. With somebody s Pekingese trying to climb into my lap. Perhaps you re right. Perhaps I didn t mean it. All I know is that I m licked.
That wasn t why I called you. Why did I hope when I hadn t any right to hope?
How bad is the other thing? The secret?
They ll look for you.
And Betty Mayfield
But that s what I m doing. Couldn t they think of that?
Killaine...
This must have cost a fortune.
Do you have to leave the note?
You wouldn t like it. I ve been there.
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
Frozen.
Wonder what?
That, and the fun of it.
Including Killaine.
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune. Most of it pretty dirty money. I don t care to have that known.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
What your father did doesn t condemn you.
That man that was following us last night he didn t come back this morning. I m beginning to wonder about him, too. Was he really following me or you?
He ll come back... They always come back when you give them money.
You killed him?
I guess I m a little screwy. Maybe I could believe it. Should I try?
And I m begging for my life and yours.
Yes. Yours. You haven t murdered anybody. You killed Mitchell. Wasn t that an accident? It must have been. If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead so that he can t talk anymore.
And that nasty man that followed us last night. You didn t kill him.
Magruder does.
But the next one is murder. First the little step, then the longer step, and then the step you can never take back. You could tell about Mitchell. You could tell about Magruder and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it. You could never tell about me.
Every day of your life you ll want me. You ll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror
If it has to be do you mind if I do it myself? Oh, I don t mean with the gun. This is no trick. When I wrote that note you have in your pocket that was no trick either. It s not so hard for me as you think. I m not crying about it, I ve been skating close to it for quite some time. The water is cold down there But so is everything else. And there s you.
Do you think I was faking?
I d like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Beer? Well, all right.
Ale. I don t mind.
I don t know her.. or particularly want to.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
I m sorry, that s all there is.
You didn t ask a question. You made a speech.
Who told you I was married?
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Stop saying you re sorry. I want information, not regrets.
Yes.
Why don t you arrest me and be done with it.
Deep blue? I d call it grey blue.
We wouldn t have met at all.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I ve known.
Who hasn t one way or another?
Is it a crime?
You were there when I last saw him.
The police always do, don t they?
You or the Vancouver Police Department?
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
You understand perfectly.
I don t want to talk.
I might be able to save you. If I knew enough.
Points very straight to her.
What does he see?
Very ridiculous.
What do your friends call you? The ones that know you well? and like you very much?
Jeff. Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people. A bad joke but better than tears.
They ll only find someone else who won t be so kind.
Because you think your in love with me?
To do what?
What will they do to you?
I ve been a soldier too. There is a difference. A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
I know that.
There s an empty taxi across the street. If you re so anxious, take it. He ll know the way to the police headquarters.
Sometimes.
We know everything.
Morning. Any calls?
All right. Get him.
You asked for it.
I m not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
You guessed it. The card s phony. I got plenty of em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
 40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I m a long way from home. I don t have a B. C. Licence. I d need about  500 for a retainer.
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I m neurotic.
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
For five hundred, what do I get?
For two hundred?
You mentioned information.
A thousand.
Got the information on you?
Why not here?
Martini.
Sometimes.
Leave that one lay.
Until he comes. He s a nice guy. You ve met him.
What s a buzzer?
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
How s life treating you?
Round of golf Saturday?
Hardly. Who s the girl?
She doesn t look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
On Miss Mayfield s balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don t ask me why. I ought to know better.
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn t use a tape measure.
I don t.
If it doesn t take too long. Drink?
I never notice the view after the first week.
I wouldn t know.
Could we discuss that some other time?
A couple of hours.
That must hurt.
Would that make me a heel?
Doesn t answer the question.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her. What toughened you up?
Don t kid me. You don t think she murdered Mitchell.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Mitchell was killed down here. How could Clarendon get in to do it? Or Margo for that matter.
Or just drunk enough. He was with her when she registered. He knew where her room was. You were out most of the evening. There was a lot of mess to clean up. Waiters coming and going, the door standing open. Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty s balcony was just below yours.
You don t buy it. Okay. So I still want Betty Mayfield. Where is she?
I m afraid they do. Far too often. So long.
Now and then. Mostly just for the fun of it.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
What?
Lay off, can t you?
Did I do something wrong?
How would you know, Brandon?
You don t throw guests out, Brandon.
Mr. Mitchell.
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
I don t think you locked your door.
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn t, there s a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel s full of passkeys.
Or since one is a well known and respected guest one could go to the desk in the lobby and say " Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key have you another "? They always have another.
And now that he s safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
That s not enough.
He saw my face too.
They ll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
How clumsy. I d never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
With what motive?
I m sorry, Inspector, I don t know much about..
No, Not recently. I m sure of that.
Floater?
You re the waterfront specialist. Find out about it. I ve got a murder to investigate.
Drunk rolling job. They hit him too hard.
I ve got a year. Or a second. I m not sure which.
Swimming with his hat on? That s original.
I understand. Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
I d suggest a telegram. Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco. A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so and so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction. His partner, name something something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction. Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist? Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police.
Would you?
Thanks, Inspector. What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
Magruder s conked out. Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent. He may come out of it and he may not. As a source of quick information, we can t forget him.
Go live in a tent.
One of those nice long manila envelopes sealed. Not too fat not too thin.
You get it s brother.
Open it and count it.
So it seems Sergeant.
I ve met her.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
I ll know when I find it.
Gigi, huh? Sounds French one of those fancy ladies. Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
Maybe we ve been pretty dumb
I think so.
If I ve got any sense I m going to call headquarters.
Before I took the story and closed the case, I d want to know a lot more about these people. I d want to know just about everything about them.
Such as?
Do I know who lives down there?
Do I know that she s out of the room? Likely to be out of it for some time?
Pretty big chance, huh?
Well. What about it?
So?
He could have tried. If he was up there in the dark, listening, he d know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it. If she telephoned, he d probably hear that.
If she didn t if luck was against him he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there drops it on the chaise.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Oh nothing.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains. Why don t you ask her about the gun?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I ve felt it myself.
I d be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I ll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
How did you know? Clarendon. You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
Of course not. Thanks for telling me. I haven t seen Mr. Clarendon.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren t you?
You didn t play it for laughs last night.
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
Not if it clears the air.
I ll investigate Mr. Clarendon s financial position
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Sure. You didn t come here in person just to tell me about the gun. You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell. If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
She s a suspect, naturally. But not the only one.
I hear she s a very pretty girl.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
I don t know, sir.
I disagree, sir. As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield s toilet articles. Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
I think you d be entirely justified, sir.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
Not too far, I hope.
What are my orders, sir?
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
Who s the girl?
Nice.
Why should I mind?
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn t easy. But you are helping me.
She s very beautiful. She s much younger than I am. And she s rich, I hope.
You ought to know why.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
You d go to jail. For a long term.
You don t have to make a pose of it.
That s not very kind.
What does it look like?
Years, why?
You already have the checks, darling.
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon s throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
How about your new friend?
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again. Be back in an hour. Right?
It s quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
It s kind of you to see me.
What a shame.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work. I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school. I m a journalist, not a historian. There are questions of method, and approach. I wondered
Yes.
It s fine, thank you.
Please do. I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
To James. I remember what it was I was going to say. We were talking about forgetfulness. The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
If you like. But don t be too modest, James. The citizen s duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books. You are highly qualified. You re a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job. Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history. A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
Actually, we ve only just met. But we re quiet good friends.
Yes.
Well, I d hate to be a nuisance.
I will, thanks.
Didn t Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
What went wrong?
Penfield. James Penfield.
But what we need is national coverage. It s difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
Not too bad, thanks. How have you been?
I m not sure I can face it.
She s fine. Well, actually we ve broken up. It s all over.
Of course.
Hello.
No thanks. I d like to break away
... break away completely from
No. I d want to
I d want to set out events as they happened. The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal. It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn t totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do. Then there s the essential
Yes, please.
Freshman and sophomores...
Thank you.
Thank you. We met last week, at the Wajda film. You won t remember. We didn t actually speak.
I quite liked it. I wasn t as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I think it went on rather too long.
And I didn t like that man.
And the shape of it all. It was sort of... shapeless.
You don t like flashbacks because your mother s a historian.
Too bad. What did your father do?
And you re at this third stage
I think you re exaggerating. And if you aren t, you should jolly well change your job.
How nice.
Both dead.
Who?
Very thoughtful.
I have to be up early.
Two or three years ago I would have stayed. And fucked you.
I don t trust anyone. That s what comes of working in television.
I think she liked me.
I haven t really thought about it.
No. It s a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother s friends specialise in monologues.
I might.
What did he want?
That ll be fun
To the airlift.
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
One or two. A grey lot. Some social democrats. Some diligent anti communists. A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
To the Fleet.
It s shit.
Let me see.
Jeremy, just let me see what you ve got.
Oh yes.
Let me see.
Mmm...
You re so gross.
Ha ha...
You ve really got it all worked out, haven t you?
We ve been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Well, everyone s desperate for a new Falkland s angle. Purdy s come up with a real dog. Worker s rights in Argentina. So I ve been running round getting people to do things. But no one s keen. Workers rights. When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights? I said to Purdy, " Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on "
On the torture of very small children, but don t start telling them about their rights
Sorry. Got held up. What are you doing here?
I m off. Let s meet. You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
Yes, finally.
Fuck off.
My God. You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
You re a piece of shit
Hello.
She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won t be long..
Why not sit down and wait?
She s not my mother, anyway. My mother s in Italy.
Have you come to talk about me?
Suez. 1956.
All right.
What about the Cromwells?
Fifteen news items. I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk. They re all old pros.
I m not here.
No.
Yes.
I dunno. Ploughman s Lunch.
U huh.
She said that?
Now listen...
Darling Susan.
And you re so beautiful. What are you doing here?
Oh no!
You d look naked without one.
Promise?
It s because he desires you. The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
I won t. Goodnight.
No.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
Two years of surgery. I missed my window. Limped through law school instead.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild. The other two always hang. They think they re some kinda death squad around here.
They re punks. Nazis. Their brains are wired wrong. They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical. It s mindless aggression. They ll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
No. So I was up the beach. I saw it going down. you didn t hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That s rare in this world.
Where?
I know that part. Tell me something I can use, here.
A flaw I m working on.
Once.
Sure, it s a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
You gotta earn trust.
Whoooaaah! Shhiiittt! Whoooaaah!
You do it... you first!
You first!
Sure you can! You may even like it... it s a killer rush. You ll see. Hey, don t I show you things, Johnny U?
But you re not alone.
Around somewhere. Listen, I m in kind of a hurry, Johnny U. What can I do for you?
And let my policy expire? Sorry.
I say when it s over!
No games, Bodhi. Pull the cord! Now!!
Pull it right now or I ll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
I m not FBI anymore.
Sir?
1322 last year in LA county. Up 26 percent from the year before.
Fine.
A little mushy.
Babes.
What? Now I m working the drop car? Who s handling the scene here?
That s the point, isn t it?
Punk. Quarterback Punk.
Never go for the vault. They never get greedy.
Well, what re your ideas on these guys?
So you re gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
Yeah. That was thirty years ago anyway. L. A. s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean. So you want to nail the Ex Presidents? Be a big hero?
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don t shave yet.
It sticks out, so I can t lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf? This was your lame o idea in the first place. You gotta back me up on this.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door. Babbit is backing me. So I want you at the side window by the hedge. You re strictly backup, got it?
This Zen master surfer.
Did he rob it?
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
Sure. No problem. I ll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious. Shit, he ll probably call out the National Guard.
Angelo, it s eleven thirty.
They took a left at the next light!
Kid, get outta the way!!
Shrimp and fries.
I need you to teach me.
I m serious.
No, no. See, all my life I ve done things for other people. In high school I played football because my old man expected me to. Then my parents always figured I d go to law school, so I did. Football scholarship. Graduated Phi Beta Kappa
Catch of the day.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them. But you can t hold it against him, he s... different.
What are you talking about?
What?
I... I don t know. I can t describe what I m feeling.
Johnny... what s going on? I don t get it... did I do something?
Betadyne doesn t hurt.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
Tyler, put the gun down.
Carefully, tough guy. Very carefully.
Who cares!
What do you mean?
I can t believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
No way, old buddy.
Like the old days, Dillon.
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They re about to get squeezed. We can t let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
Who s our back up on this?
Jesus... this is inhuman. Uh... I wasn t told of any operations in this area. They shouldn t have been here.
That s right, I set you up. You re a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
Because I told you, you re the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn t get you in here without a cover story.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
We re going to need everyone.
We re not going.
This isn t your style, Dillon.
What, Sergeant?
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
What s that, General?
There s something else, Major...
Hawkins?
I think it s Hawkins.
He knows our defenses.
No wonder. For starts, you should know that hot pants are horrid, even when you do have the legs to carry them off. What are your plans while you re in town?
You ll want a cocktail dress then. Turn. You have a beautiful figure. A little too out in the open but simply lovely. Size six? Do you need shoes?
He s not really my uncle.
I don t think so. You should know we re going to fight you with every resource we have.
Huh? Oh... yeah. S okay? Uhm... how re... business things going.
Please, we hardly know each other.
No.
Storage, I think.
You what?
What?
You ve got a lot of nerve.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing. Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
I don t question the legality of what you do. It s your morality that makes me sick. I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
Expected... offer.
Yes.
This time I imagine you would, yes. Hmm... With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can t logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
What s that?
Uh, no. How do I get to Beverly Hills?
Yes.
Actually, I m a movie star out for a walk.
Sure. For five bucks.
The price just went up to ten.
Sit... and spin.
No.
You re not from L. A., huh?
What motel you staying at?
Okay, what ho tel?
What do you want it to be? Vivian, my name s Vivian.
It pays.
Tell me about it. L. A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been. I mean, I use condoms. Always. And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic. Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I m probably safer.
If you re making fun of me, I don t like it.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
For an hour.
I never joke about money.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
Fine.
Edward. My name is Edward.
What?
Why?
You mean they don t have hookers.
Off the boulevard.
Diet coke.
Can I have some chips?
Do you plan everything?
Well, the meter s running, it s your money. Speaking of which, cash ll do. In advance.
Right. So! In town on business?
Let me guess, you re a... lawyer.
Why?
Jesus, you act like you re seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Just a romantic, that s you.
You didn t wake me. I ll be out of here in a minute.
Yeah. Too good. I forgot where I was.
I took the couch. I had some work to do. About last night...
Mmm, I could tell.
I like guys if that s what you re asking. Not that I trust m.
I sell them.
What are assets?
C mon, I might buy a company some day.
Sorta like stealing cars and selling m for parts, huh?
There, see? Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
I fucked the debate team in high school. Tsk. I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays. You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
What?
Of course. How much?
Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1, 500.
All right, two thousand.
Done.
Look butthead, I ll treat you so nice you ll never want to let me go, okay?
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
I got a dress, yeah.
It s very tasteful. I think you ll especially like the zipper in the crotch. I m joking.
No, I don t " got it ". Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they re taking you on a date.
Go by yourself then. Where you taking me anyway?
Any good?
... all right. I ll meet you in the lobby. But only cause you re paying me to.
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
Upset. No. I never get upset about business.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant. It s business. There s no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
Television?
I have work to do.
I wasn t as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you? It works.
I had a little problem in one store. I wasn t dressed right. I don t know what to say. I don t belong there. Maybe I ll just go back to Bridget. She was cool.
Good.
Thank you. I would. Nice.
No.
I think it s exciting.
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
He s good at what he does.
I m sure that s true for some of them.
I don t know what you re talking about.
Would you please calm down. Tell me what happened.
I want my fucking money. I m getting out of here. I don t want anything more to do with you.
Vivian...
Fine. I m only here a couple of more days and I m not going to spend them fighting with you.
I m not hurt. It doesn t hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
Shush. Of course you can.
You won t.
Where are you taking me!?
Huh?
Vivian. I m paying you to be you. Be you. Have you? Ever been in love with anyone?
I ll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you. But you ll be surprised how much you understand. The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
I more than liked it.
Did you?
Yeah, you ve been pretty tough to take.
It wouldn t be like that. I want to get you off the street. You ll have a different kind of life. What s wrong with that?
I know. Hey, don t mind me. I m being stupid. I ll think about it, okay? It s a real good offer for a whore.
What do you mean?
Vivian, I want you to listen to me. The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son s future, if he cooperated.
It s not your concern. It s... business, that s all.
Yes. The man made a business decision.
Not all men hit. And no one is going to hit you anymore.
It was good.
Stay with me tonight. Not because you re being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
Vivian...
Give me your car keys, will you, I m going back to my hotel.
Really? Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do? No, thank you. I just got off the phone with one.
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
You shouldn t go alone. He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
Oh, god, what?
I m here.
Eight o clock. Kross is bringing his son. Very bright kid, watch yourself with him. Who s this girl you re taking?
Someone s loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
We re letting them slide?
But, Edward...
Come on, Bill, don t talk to me about how much money s involved. It s my money.
We just did.
The night I left your house, I was lost. I was looking for directions.
Yes...
Vivian s in sales.
So now they re best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we re trying to buy. It s too convenient.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous. Edward, how do you know she hasn t attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Bill? Stop panicking. Kross isn t going anywhere and I don t need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down. I ll be in the office tomorrow.
I m up.
Why?
Give me twenty minutes.
I suppose you d use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn t you?
I think I broke my hand. You re fired.
And I don t like what we ve become. I ll cover any losses you have on this one. Now get out, you asshole!
Don t be mad at me. I ll pay you back. I promise.
I will. I m trying. Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket. There isn t even milk in the fridge. The rent s due. Now come on
Kit! Where ve you been?
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I m at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it s this absolutely unbelievable place and he s hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he s paying me three thousand bucks! We can get out of the apartment. We can get out of this town. We can do anything! Kit? Hey, you there?
I m sorry, Viv. Carlos has been on my back. Did you get the money up front like I taught ya?
I m getting dressed now. I ll be over. Bye.
In Beverly Hills?
Was that you?
Carlos. I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Everybody keeps starin at me.
What do you know? You look good. All dressed up. You clean up real nice. You sure don t fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin like you do. Not that you ever did anyway.
Honey, you re not supposed to do that.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
Dummy.
I pray for that.
Go for the bucks.
Get a job and probably go back to school. Figure out what I m gonna be.
School, school. Regular. I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
Yeah. Well... I gotta split. Goodbye s make me crazy.
No. You took care of rent, that s enough.
Rent. You re late.
Kit give me nothin.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
I leave extras, miss.
Yeah. Thanks.
Then I m here till I die?
Then why bother curing me?
Of course you will.
Hear this now: I will come for you.
Move? You re alive. If you want, I can fly.
Well... you were dead.
I will never doubt again.
But how is that possible, since he s been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
Westley, what about the R. O. U. S. s?
Gently.
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
It never happened.
Did you say, " I do "?
Who s Guilder?
I just don t think it s right, killing an innocent girl.
I thought I was going faster.
Well, I m carrying three people. And he s got only himself.
What do I do?
He s really very short on charm.
It s you.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
How many could you handle?
What?
Where?
But you don t know where he is.
The body?
I have a little.
What s the difference? We ve got him. Help me here. We ll have to force feed him.
Where did you get that?
What?
And our assets?
True, but that s hardly common knowledge, is it? Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we re inside.
I thought he was with you.
Offer me everything I ask for
You re sure nobody s following us?
No reason. It s only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
You know what a hurry we re in.
A little bit.
What?
Mom, can t you tell him that I m sick?
He ll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick. She also owns 50  of the profits.
Oh joy of joys! Oh, dream of dreams! I can t believe it. Birds, birds, do you hear? Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear? Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer s name. Fly, fly, spread the words.
" Deutchland, Deutchland... "
Vat?
Where are you going vit the light?
What have you done, LSD?
I mean in show business.
What do you do best?
Oh, sing. Sing!
No good, baby, no good. You heard my orders. Nobody retreats. Attack! Attack!
Hey, man, let s stomp Switzerland!
Heil, baby! I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
I told them we invaded England.
We won.
In the past two days I ve been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
Sit down. I don t want to trouble you, just want to ask...
No.
I m looking for a missing person. My name s Arbogast, private investigator... Trying to trace a young girl who s been missing almost a week. From Phoenix. It s a private matter... family wants to forgive her... She isn t in trouble.
I m not the police.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane s the real name, but she might ve registered...
What?
Tell me all about her.
How early?
Of which morning?
No one met her?
Or arrived with her.
She didn t call anyone? Even locally?
You didn t spend the whole night with her did you?
How do you know she didn t make a call?
Back where?
You said she was sitting " back there, " or standing rather...
How did she pay you?
Cash or check? For the cabin...
And when she left, she never came back.
I do mind. If it don t jell, it ain t aspic! This ain t jelling.
She isn t still here, is she?
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
Anyone at home?
Someone is sitting in that window.
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you d have no reason to hide her would you?
If she paid you well?
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn t be fooled... you d know she was just using you. Wouldn t you?
I didn t mean that as a slur on your manhood. I m sorry.
Your mother met her? Can I talk to your mother?
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you d miss.
No! Just no! I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I m near it. There s just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Who are you, friend?
Must ve needed it.
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
Sam, they don t want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
He s lunching with the man who s buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man... so that s why he s late. You getting a headache?
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
A lot?
With the forty thousand dollars?
Like what?
I think something s wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what s wrong. I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates... and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
What difference does that...
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn t make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do! Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that s the sooner you ll stand a chance of your sister bein picked up. How about that?
May I talk to you?
Lila.
I want to know if my sister is here.
With you.
I don t know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven t heard from her, not even a phone call.
A good reason, I suppose.
Mr. Loomis, you re so busy being defensive that you haven t even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
What do you know about it?
Huh?
I hate tears.
Yes.
Not that kind... You men and your egos.
It was her boss idea not to report it to the police?
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
No.
How could I go away? I m in debt up to my... If she did steal that money... It s hard to believe she did because it s hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
I didn t see her... and I didn t hear from her! Believe that!
You ve led a charmed life.
Maybe we can handle it together.
I think she ll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don t you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
She ll need both of us.
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God looks out for everybody look and... I feel better.
Where s the old highway?
Yes.
Patience doesn t run in our family. Sam, I m going out there!
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Sam, I m going.
Why can t I go out there with you?
Just wait here?
Sam.
Where could he have gone?
Without calling me?
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don t you think he d have called if he had anything...
Who s he?
Well?
Does that mean we can t...
I don t know where to start... Except at the beginning.
Of course we will.
I didn t. I got a job, too. I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me? Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don t let them.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
This is the old highway.
Watch your tenses.
I m going with you. But we d better decide what we re going to say and do when we walk in...
You won t believe it... But this will be the first time I ve ever pulled one of those man and wife renting cabin capers!
I know. Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
How could we prove... Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
What makes you sound so certain?
Hospital clean.
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Do we simply ask him where he s hidden it?
Why not?
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
Checking out time is three P. M. Hotels of this sort aren t interested in you when you come in, but when your time s up... Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
When you re married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
Sam!
I ve lost my girlish laughter.
Sam. This is the last time.
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn t even come.
I haven t time to argue. I m a working girl.
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
Can you?
You couldn t be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
I have to go, Sam.
No.
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother s picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
Sam! No!
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
I haven t even been married once yet!
Sam, let s go get married.
I m thinking of it.
Don t miss your plane.
You have a vacancy?
I thought I d gotten off the main...
There s a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
The bathroom.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
I have?
Thank you. Again.
No.
I d like to.
Mother...... what is the phrase... " she isn t herself today "... I think that s it.
You d know, of course.
Uncommon, too.
It s not as expensive as you d think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust.. the chemicals are all that cost anything.
It s more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
Oh, no! I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
Friends? Who needs friends. A boy s best friend is his mother. You ve never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Where are you going? I don t mean to pry...
What are you running away from?
No. People never run away from anything. The rain didn t last very long. You know what I think? I think we re all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
I was born in mine. I don t mind it anymore.
Oh I do... but I say I don t.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I d like to... curse her out and leave her forever! Or at least, defy her. But I couldn t. She s ill.
I mean... ill. She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn t have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when. Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it s nothing to talk about when you re eating. Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover.
To a private island, like you?
It s too late for me. And besides... who d look after her? She d be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don t do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don t hate her. I hate... what she s become. I hate... the illness.
I m sorry... I didn t mean it to sound uncaring...
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
Yes, and just one time can be enough. Thank you.
Norman.
I m very tired. And I ll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
I stepped into a private trap back there and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out. Before it s too late for me, too.
I d like to, but...
Very early. Dawn.
Crane.
Yes. I didn t mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I d have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
Yes. As I said, I couldn t keep my eyes...
I didn t intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
Then I m free to go...?
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something s wrong?
Please... I d like to go...
Is there what? I ve told you there s nothing wrong... except that I m in a hurry and you re taking up my time...
I m sorry.
Why?
I suppose you want a cabin.
Haven t any.
Yes, matter of fact. The wife s taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I d look you up and... talk.
Yes.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn t it?
This place! This isn t a place. It s my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
I don t know what you ve been saying.
Do what?
Shut up!
Leave me alone!
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he ll be pleased.
That s only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
 Perfectly friendly, my dear.  At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Sure I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
I knew there was a catch in this some place but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
Quiet, will you? This is ser ious. Our lives are in danger.
Who are you? What is your name?
No I don t want to give any money. Everybody wants money I m not going to give any money.
You a friend to me?
Papers they all want me to sign papers.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
Maybe you re right.
He s been stealing my cats to experiment on  them . I know cause I ve been  watching  spying on him.
Oh, no. It s my own idea. I m in the business. In the fur business.
That s it. You get it quick.
Well, news of Buckley?
Why, Buckley stole that body. That s what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Oh, yes, he s in good hands now.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He s in the hospital. How about it?
It won t do any good. They are a pair of would be mur deresses fighting it out.
Oh, I m crazy, am I? Let me tell you something. Those women have the gleam
The wound is bleeding!
I m losing my blood!
Yes!
A voice...
That called... commanded...
Yes!
Yes.
No?
No I didn t. It was Igor at the waxworks.
No the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn t have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
I met one last night... all the money this side of Peoria.
I don t think you could have a real affair. You couldn t care for anyone.
I don t agree with you.
You would.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
I can t convince the inner woman that we can wait. She s howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I ve only had a cup of coffee since last night.
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don t step on it. I m going to bow out on you.
I m hungry. I ll eat the first child I see. And I ve an appointment with young Winton at 8: 30.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there ll be a million dollar tune.
She isn t anybody s friend, and I don t like you living with her. She s a bad influence.
What s nice about her?... a hard boiled little gold digger.
Well, I do say it.
Don t kid yourself she means it.
I d call it stupid at any time.
So that s the way it is?
Thank you.
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
Oh, you children, you happy children. You ve quarreled and now you re going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault... He should be along very shortly... But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault... While you re waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
The body of Joan Gale!
I m not kidding. Joan Gale s body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
What do you think I am?
It happens that I m the law.
You mean he was colored?
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
Yeah. Have a pleasant vacation?
Great. Consider yourself crippled financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year s!
That is none of our business. But you bring me something for the next edition if it s only a recipe for spaghetti!
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn t have pinched him. But he s George Winton and they re playing him up. It s a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
I wouldn t be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn t it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
No, I mean it. I think this kid s entitled to a break.
You give me a pain!
Well, anyway, he couldn t have copped that body he was in jail.
Well, I won t work on it from that angle.
And they never proved anything against him.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Well, that s got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else.
Great!... If he s worthless we ll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on beat it. It s five o clock. You need some sleep.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
Now don t that call for an extra!
Well, you can t blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
No kiddin. What s your idea?
We ll grant that.
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
I used to be married to one.
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don t you think they d know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard you ll be all right.
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
Almost certain.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
What do you mean haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three for a dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You re grand! I m for you! Stupendous!
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don t feel like talking to you.
What goofy idea have you got now? Don t tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
How s every little thing?
I m people which the old year saw out. I m canned, fired!
I ve got to make news, if I have to bite a dog. Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That s not news. I heard about it last year.
No foolin any suspect?
Old Howard Winton s cub?
They don t suspect him?
Say, if you re stringin me, Old Timer...
What does that prove?
There s an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
It s all yours.
He s not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he s a police dog.
Plain clothes man. Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington... a fate worse than death.
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner s banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Gee, honey bunch, I m sorry I m going to have to disappoint you.
No use. He s a crab, I tell you.
I m after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Gee, that s great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Come on, old man, that won t do. You know you re innocent until proven guilty.
Cry baby?
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you ve got to prove. Dad won t stand for
For a few minutes the afternoon before before
They didn t give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn t care for each other any more but we needn t hate each other...... She said she wanted to be friends.
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
No. Why didn t I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me?... You re working with the police!... You re trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You re trying...
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie?...
Who d steal her body?
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
What! And let every rag in town grab a red hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
You go in for dangerous things.
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I ve only known you twenty four hours, but I m in love with you.
No, really I m crazy about you.
You don t believe me. You think I m just talking. Will you marry me?
Heaven knows. A lot.
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh I have never seen anything more exquisite.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you ll grant me the privilege, I d like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
I regret I can t spend the time I d like with your exhibition, but I m going to worry the life out of you when I come back.
Good night, sir.
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn t paid?
No I m lying to amuse myself! Now look here, I ve an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven t twopence between us, but we ve got these.
I want the money back I ve thrown into this rubbish heap.
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
You re insane.
One of the maids in waiting for that Elizabethan group.
That doesn t seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
But the composition as a whole I ve tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period... you will be gone for good.
Yes, sir, it s here on the truck, but it s pretty heavy I ll need help.
Good. Well, I ll be seeing you.
They didn t have a leg to stand on. There s no case against me. It s a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
You did.
You did miss
Excuse me???
I m heading out of town.
Where to?
What universe are you in, Paul?
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
That s what it asked me. " What do you want? " I didn t answer. I was in the middle of an experiment.
A five hundred foot thick steel wall. But the connection between these two electrons is so
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together
Then you get it. You ll understand.
Is Rose here?
Well, I got to see her.
Where is she?
Sex isn t ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
I don t think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
Buddy. Well, now, that s a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you. Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
Nobody.
They were just bad men, that s all.
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain t no sense to it.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I ll say that. He s the best and most kind hearted man in the world.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
Well, it s only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost. I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
What is it, Rose?
What d you do, Rose?
You were pretty bad, huh?
But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
What did you expect?
Ha ha ha, that s some idea, a cantaloupe.
Buddy, quit that, you re just a child, you re not supposed to be interested in such things.
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what s going to come out of his mouth next.
No, you can t. And I ll tell you this he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can t fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin like that with him again, he ll fire me.
Buddy, what s come over you? A child like you, askin such things.
Buddy, you don t realize it but what you re doing isn t nice.
You don t need to know that. It s none of your business.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
First I couldn t feel it, but now I feel it easily, it s like a little acorn.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
It was softer n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
Well, some fiend might.
There s an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
I m curious to see what it s like. I m very curious, Rose.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
Can t I touch it a little, Rose not a lot, just a little?
Please, Rose. I m curious, that s all, I have a natural curiosity, it s only human. You re my friend, aren t you? Don t you like me? I like you, Rose, a lot in fact, I love you.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
I m thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It s only nature, Rose, that s all. Now what s wrong with nature, huh?
But Rose...
Am I hurting you?
But why, if I m not hurting you?
Don t worry, Rose, I won t tell a soul.
I said I wouldn t.
You re going to get yourself up and go out?
Yeah.
Rose, if you don t keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
He did?
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
Yeah, I d believe it.
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
You won t die, Rose.
Okay.
What are you going to do, Rose?
They re dumb things. I got tired of them.
Five hundred rabbits?
How did the rabbits kill him?
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
What was your mother like?
Oh, Waski, you don t even know what we re talking about.
Oh, Waski, you don t know anything.
All right, what do you know?
Well, a little.
I don t know.
Yeah, he s still up there.
I don t know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
Well, it s not very plain.
But how would you find him?
Well, I don t know. No, I don t know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
Well... maybe...
Daddy, what s the matter?
Wonderful. What s she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn t confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn t go by the hotel.
Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn t reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
What did you say, Brother?
No, you didn t say that, Brother.
She s getting herself up to go out.
She s getting herself up to go out. I think she s coming down the hall now.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She s getting better and we don t want any more trouble Brother, you ought to hear this.
I think Daddy suspects.
She s watching the car again?
Yeah.
They re discussing it.
Ohhh hh... what s happening now?
What are they doing?
What are they doing, Doll?
Is that all?
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don t see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
Buddy, I m worried about Rose.
She hasn t got any sense. In some ways, she s awful dumb.
Then why does she act so dumb?
They ve been in there the longest kind of time. I can t stand it, I gotta find out what s going on.
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she s fighting like a tiger. But I don t know, it s close, it s mighty close.
Rose says she s goin to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don t think so.
That s the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
Yes, it s so nice I thought I d work outside.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
What?
Oh. Did you say something?
Honey, she s perfect. She works all the time and she s wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won t admit it. I think she s just perfect.
And she s such a good hearted thing, there isn t an ounce of harm or malice in her.
There are no flies on Rose, I don t know what you re talking about.
Hope for the best? I don t understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn t want to live at all. What you can t understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
I m not in the fourth dimension you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
Be nice to Rose. She s never had a real home.
I think about what I m doing all the time, and I ve got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn t feeling well.
I m serious. We forget he s just a child. I wish you d speak to him.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn t as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
You re not having lunch?
The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
She will succeed.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I m beginning to see why.
Well, she loves children, all right. She loves everybody.
You are the one who s good hearted. As for Rose, let s hope for the best.
What time is it?
Is she all right?
No reason at all, darlin.
Forgive my crudity, darlin. All I m saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it s all swollen.
Scoundrels? They weren t scoundrels, they were just boys.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat s what they were, and why shouldn t she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don t you think she s human the same way you are yourself? It s the South, that s what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do you mock me!
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
It isn t her fault if she s popular... what?
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn t mean any harm and it ll break the children s hearts, they all love her.
Who is to say our morals are better than hers? But maybe you re right. She could... influence Dolly...
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she s not immoral. Not really.
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
They follow her because she s a no, I won t say that.
Darlin, Rose has got to go!
You don t like him because he s a Yankee. He s a brilliant doctor.
I don t care where the polecat studied.
She can t get a job, it s a depression. And we can t just throw her out on the street.
She s just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
Just a minute, Rose, you don t understand. This isn t a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it s nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop s, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it s not a farm, damn it, it s a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it s ideal!
I don t give a hoot in hell s hollow what it means to her! She can t stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
That s why I m asking her who the father is. It s the most vital question of all. Who s the father, dear?
What did you forget?
Well, now, darlin... give me a chance to defend myself.
Well, I... I hadn t thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it s an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
Well, I know, more so. That s why I was thinking... maybe she d be better off.
I don t understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Who?
Well, yes, she s happy. Of course Dave doesn t have her life force, not at all. There isn t much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife s belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Oh, I don t know, I... I...
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Don t make me... me... me... get up!
Oh, I know. She s so sweet, she s been so good to me...
Nothin, just goin to the bathroom.
No, sir.
Got yourself up?
If you ve got time before you go " out, " get me a half a cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half a cup.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
Yes, sir.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
Yes, sir.
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn t even know I had that tooth pulled.
Boy, for four or five days there I didn t think I d live. But I m my old self again!
That s all you ve got to say, you ve got a bad cold?
I have to go back to the hotel. I m on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Well, it s Billy.
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy s very poor, he don t have no money and there wasn t no place else to go.
He s a nice boy, you d like him. He wants to be a fireman.
What s the use, there ain t none.
Tennessee?
Well. What kinda job is it?
You mean a farm?
Mine.
Yes, mine. I m going to have one.
No, you re not.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you re pregnant?
I don t believe it.
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn t even know I been in the hospital.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
You mustn t be a tattletale, dear. You mustn t be Delilah ish and Jezebel ish toward your brother, dear.
You can stop it right now.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
More history, Rose.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don t you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co Cola?
I like to work. I don t mind work. It s the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me. You re so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
No, ma am, I m just fine.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don t know who he is, I really don t.
Ohh hh, a little. Oh h, I ain t never been to no dentist before. He s gonna kill me, I just know it.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We re trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
I know it was bad, honey. I m sorry...
Yeah, it s kinda nice.
Well, you re real sweet to make it for me. There never was nobody like you. And you don t need to worry, I ain t goin out no more.
Rose, really, you shouldn t act like that.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
Well... well, that s wonderful, Rose.
Incestuous.
Put up your kickstand, freak. Start talking, or we re out the door.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
I ll tell you what... I think it s all you ve got.
What and? That s what I got.
Now you know what to watch for...
Hey, listen... I ll give you something else, Kittle. Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach? It was never identified...
Alright, wait... there s a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
I m telling you, you re barking up the wrong tree.
If I tell you, how do I know you won t just club me and take it back?
What...?
I don t know what you re talking about, man. Even if I did, I m not so crazy I m gonna cross Zimmermann.
I need the " when " and the " where. "
She s fine, as if you cared.
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
Lay off once, would you?
Jeez... it s too early in the morning for this. Leave off. Here s your paper.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
That wasn t my fault.
We catch em, I wanna be first to hurt em. Promise me I get to go first.
No you can t.
I d rather you guys didn t do this again.
Relax.
Well... we shouldn t rush into this, right? Let s talk about it.
I m just saying...
Yeah, but if we don t sit, they ll take our badges.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Clench your teeth.
What?
Name one.
Okay, seriously. What about Napoleon, huh?
They shot us all, kid.
You don t smoke.
It s just the way things are, kiddo.
Wha...?
Bullshit.
I m back here, aren t I? So, you don t have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
" Leo. The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement. Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear. "
Follow me.
We re not stealing. We re borrowing.
This is the police lock up. We re police. How can we steal from ourselves?
Can t you say something nice once?
If we don t catch a break soon, we re gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
No.
Nope.
There probably is.
Yeah, non believer? Here s yours... " Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution... "
" Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field. By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner. "
You know... you could say thank you.
First of all, the Constitution wasn t writtem till 1787...
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn t do anything about slavery, did it?
Slow down.
You think this is so easy?
Oh yeah?
He s right. We hit the bricks, we walk back triple fucked.
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle, It s the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
Dead.
Just got here.
A. D. is a C. P. A.
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant. But, that s all we got.
See... now that we know you know, the hard part s done for us.
Know what I love about dynamite?
When you bunch it together, it s exponentially more powerful. Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
Yeah.
It s one of a kind.
They re... around.
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug peddling " escort service " of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
You won t get another chance at this, Admiral.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn t be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
You cannot escape your destiny.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
I can t kill my own father.
Yoda spoke of another.
But I have no sister.
Leia! Leia s my sister.
I can t see.
Where am I?
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Luke!
Fine. Together again, huh?
How are we doing?
There s nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I ve taken care of everything.
I m endangering the mission. I shouldn t have come.
Will you take it easy? Let s just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Leia!
He wasn t. I can feel it.
Lower it!
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
Good, I hate long waits.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn t be proper.
Come on! Come on!
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
We shall double our efforts.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Quiet.
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
Just... images, really. Feelings.
Luke, tell me. What s troubling you?
Your father?
I know. Somehow... I ve always known.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
But, why must you confront him?
I know, father.
I will not turn... and you ll be forced to kill me.
Search your feelings, father. You can t do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
There is no conflict.
I will not fight you.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Certainly not!
I know, but it wasn t all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable. Oh so soft. So sensual.
Shush. Janet s probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott. His name is not unknown to me.
And now he works for your Government, doesn t he, Brad? He s attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U. F. O s. Isn t he, Brad?
Janet.
Janet.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
Everyone knows Betty s a wonderful little cook.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
I ve got something to say.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride s bouquet.
Oh dear! But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
We must have a blow out.
But where will you go? We re in the middle of nowhere.
There s no point both of us getting wet.
For God s sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
It s just a.. a party Janet.
We can t go anywhere until I get to a phone.
Let s wait awhile Janet. We don t want to interfere with their celebrations.
They re probably foreigners with ways different from our own. They may do some more folk dancing.
Weiss.
It s alright Janet. Everything s going to be alright.
No, don t do that.
Janet! Oh! Yes it s alright. Janet. Everything s going to be alright.
So baby don t cry like there s no tomorrow After the night there s a brand new day. And there ll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It ll be O. K.
And that s all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you ve found Is back again.
Uh oh Hi! My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss. I ah wondered if you could help us. Our car has broken down about two miles up the road. Do you have a phone we might use?
You know this earth this person.
A decision had to be made.

I don t think you re a bum.
Morning after?

Sparrin?
I know ya need sparrin partners I m very available.
Absolutely Sparrin with the Champ would be an honor y know what?
... Like I said, I d make a boss sparrin mate.
Sure, an I m smart enough to know that no sparrin partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He s just there to help condition the man.
What d you say?
Hey

Freak luck for sure.
Turtles domestic turtles.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an a good rep can t be bought, but I don t have to tell you that.
Rocky, d ya know what I done?
I done it all. I ve done an seen everything. Believe what I m tellin ya Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked Ginny Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager September 14, 1923.
Ya got heart.
... Ya gave Dipper my locker.
The fight s set I don t need a manager.
I got pain an experience too.

Yo, Benny.

Yeah See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
Bullmastiff.
Yo, Rocky Look at this mirror. I d like to kill the friggin moron who broke this mirror.
What?
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Looks, huh?
My sister s a friggin loser.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I d like to split her head with a razor.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
I m thirty myself.
I don t see no crowd around you, neither.
... Sure.
I hate the friggin game... I d like to talk some business.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Gazzo s gotta come to you.

Don t talk dirty bout ya sister.
Whatta these guys want?
Yo, what s with you? It was suppose to be private.
What can I do about it?
... People talk to me more.
Apollo s a great fighter.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
You ll have it in the morning. Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Check the scrawl.
No kiddin? Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Oh, yeah? Well, you re not handcuffed to him. Anybody in the back room?
That was the rabbit s wife.
Probably lookin for a good place to stick a knife.
Maroon, right?
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Sounds like singin.
I ll bet.
What ve I got to lose? You okay, Dolores?
That ll work out just fine. When this thing is over, I ll take you to Catalina. How does that sound?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon. He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back. Is that true?
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work. The rabbit didn t contact you by any chance, did he?
So you wouldn t have any idea where he might be?
They?
Downtown? Fine. Get a hold of Santino, I d be more than glad to talk to him.
Indeed we are. We ll continue the interrogation there.
The pot s callin the kettle maniacal.
So you re Cloverleaf?
What the hell s a freeway?
That s what this is all about? Tell me, who s gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
Surprised?
Earl... it s me, Valiant.
Toon cops worked me over.
No...
Not much. It s hard to talk.
He was blowin his lines, all right. So what?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
So what do you want me to do?
I don t work in Toontown.
The job s gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
Valiant? What re you doin here?
I ve already seen your photographs.
Have you got the will?
Meet me at my studio at nine o clock. If you ve got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
No... I m not. I m a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
No, I don t.
Take it easy.
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
I do bite my thumb, sir!
If you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you.
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Leave Me!
Then I ll leave thee.
Not to his father s; I spoke with his man.
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father s house.
Romeo will answer it?
Nay, he will answer the letter s master, how he dares, being dared.
Why, what is Tybalt?
Am I like Such a fellow?
By my head here come the Capulets.
Good morrow, cousin.
But new struck cuz.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo s hours?
In love?
Of love?
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
No, cuz, I rather weep.
At thy good heart s oppression.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
A right good marks man! And she s fair I love.
Well, in that hit you miss: she ll not be hit With Cupid s arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint seducing gold:
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Teach me how I should forget to think.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Young Romeo is it?
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
He shall be endured
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
What? Now. St. Peter s Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to morrow, By one that I ll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I ll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
I uh, by and by I come But if thou mean st not well, I do beseech thee
I am a weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man s, yet his leg excels all men s; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other other side, O, my back.
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous, Where is your mother?
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Have you got leave to go to confession to day?
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Amen
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Then move not, while my prayer s effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
Ay me!
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I ll no longer be a Capulet.
' Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What s Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What s in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call d, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
Ahhh!
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
With love s light wings did I o er perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
I have night s cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit tree tops
Well what shall I swear by?
If my heart s dear love
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
The exchange of thy love s faithful vow for mine.
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
Romeo! At what o clock to morrow Shall I send to thee?
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is t my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Under love s heavy burden do I sink.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
I dream d a dream to night.
Well, what was yours?
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk st of nothing.
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there s a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
That s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Right.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
I thought all for the best.
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a... a blow.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
What wouldst thou have with me?
Is she a Capulet?
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done. We don t even know what it is. What did we steal?
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you re running the show. And I don t believe you d be running this show if you didn t know what was going on.
So where do you go from here?
Who the fuck are you?
Some places, not all. Italy, for instance, they re serious about their food. But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U. K., you don t get much fancier than a deep fried bar egg. Food s not our thing, you see.
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Budweiser? You talk to me of beer and you ve the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence? That s not beer! Christ, it s not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
Now there s the Deirdre I know.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you. You ve been living the life of the hired gun the well paid hired gun, I might note. There s no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
It s been known to happen.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
They re part of the team. One of them s the guy I told you about.
Plastic fucking surgeon? You think I m going to fix this, Deirdre lass? It s the mark of the patriot, and I ll wear it like a badge. As for those who done it to me, I ll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
You were a soldier, were you?
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
I didn t think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
Is that right?
Nobody s saying they don t.
You don t have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
You re a hired gun, Deirdre just like me.
Duty calls?
Check this out. Gregor s a spook, or he was one until recently. When he was a spy he lived the life you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything. Then the wall goes down. No more Cold War. And Gregor is out of a job. No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes. I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn t want to give it up. And I wouldn t be surprised if he s arrogant enough to think...
Oh please.. you re on some sort of holy mission?
Don t even think that I m buying that.
I didn t say I was.
Good, because it cost enough. There s cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
You sure about this?
But would you stake your life, that s the question...
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target. I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
Don t do it, Sam!
I m touched, really, that they d send someone of your caliber. It s nice to know that they didn t make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
I m sure. But I m sorry to say that it s too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
Really? Do you have the money with you?
You first, Edvard.
Not so fast. Who s that?
Bad company...
There s been a slight problem.
I take it you still want the money...
In here...
No, Mikhi, I wouldn t. Since I won t speak your language, and you can t speak mine, English will do nicely.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
It is, I m telling you it is!!
But you hate each other!
Figured enough to know there s an odd man out and I m looking at him.
I don t have it with me...
I swear...
I sent it to myself in Paris.
I hadn t thought about it. Understand me, Gregor I take no pleasure in killing. It doesn t bother me one bit, but I don t get off on it.
That s it.
There is one other thing...
Don t cross me...
Really?
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
Gets the job done.
Not for long.
Is that right?
What a surprise...
Who s they?
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain t that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Eat shit and die slowly...
You should learn a little patience.
It s consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
What makes you think we re here to meet you?
Coordinate what?
To see a man about a thing.
As in, they own it?
And I suppose he s saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
Jujitsu.
Not at all. Similar, but not the same.
I have, I don t know, maybe a cigarette a week.
I do.
It has it s moments. Course, you get cancer and die, that s the down side.
Like Larry or Swede.
Let s just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited. Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn t seem like the right candidate for this.
So is the woman.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
I wanted to see who you were.
That s right: there s not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow. Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn t afford not to take it. Somebody s paying through the nose for this.
I just wanted to see something.
I needed to see if you were a cop. I m a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together. And that s the guy you have to watch out for. I hate cops...
Know what?
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head. I figured he wasn t pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
You were smoking?
Of course... whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
A lot of people died.
I haven t. Not like that. How do you get used to it?
I won t lie there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn t.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth. I m a hood, a thief. Big time in a small time king of way. To the local police I m a prize, to the local hoods I m a legend. But to a guy like you I m just another two bit hired gun.
Not necessarily. He could go off road at any number of places. He might not even be in the country anymore.
I didn t save your life back there. Risked it, maybe but I didn t save shit.
You know one around here? Somebody you trust?
No hospitals. I ll fix this myself if I have to.
Not exactly.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I d have busted you a long time ago. This isn t about you, it s about the job I have to do.
We? There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
This doesn t involve you, don t you understand? I can t even guarantee you any money out of all this.
You don t have to do this.
You see the bullet?
The address of the Russian production company. Just in case we need to find them.
Do what?
It s my job.
Sure I do. You heard him, you heard the guy that s what he said, what Edvard said.
Dark ops?
Very ugly.
Not very zen of you, huh? Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
I know. Jean Pierre did.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn t want to kill him if I didn t have to.
I would have tried not to. But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
You think?
I don t know...
Right now?
Business keeps you on the road?
So I do it.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
Just like that?
What of it? Samurai pain in the ass.
Why? You ve got more force of will than anyone I ve ever seen. You handle a gun like it s a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia... And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
Why then, Sam, don t you act like this is a job like any other? Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Why not?
Closest and oldest.
And when you finish? What then? This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA? Do you really think they deserve it?
Do you have a good answer?
Finish the job...
What?
What of it?
You don t owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it. You stepped in front of a bullet for me. I owe you a heavy debt.
You better get some sleep, alright?
I don t know. Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us. There s probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don t think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
Gone. Destroyed.
You sure?
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
You should have kill him when you had the chance. But no...
I m alright. And you?
A friend. I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
Dwayne listen to me
I don t know what you re
Well I hope so. That pretty much cleaned me out.
Seven thousand...
Cash and what?
Never heard of it.
I probably would have. I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
There must be over a million dollars in here.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Look around you partner! You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Robbed a bank, c mon! Don t you think we would have heard if one, two shit I don t know how many were at large! Don t you think there would be a bulletin? This is a big ass drug deal!
Come on Booth! Look at these scumbags around us. Who s going to know what happened! Let s take it and get out of here!
Why?
Suppose someone knows about the money? They re bound to ask questions.
It s going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
What makes you so sure?
Oh so God s like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
At the expense of six people.
What are you gonna do?
You re thinking about killing him. I can t do that. No way. I ve never killed a man. Never even shot at one...
I... I can t do that.
That s not what I mean.
I don t want to hear about miracles and God and all that! We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
Fair enough, I ll take it to my place.
I don t know...
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
We assaulted a Federal agent. We killed him.
Are you nuts? They ll fry us for sure. There s no way we re doin that, you understand? No way.
What are you thinking?
Well neither have I, but it s us or him. If he talks, or writes a note or whatever, he s gonna turn us in. Besides, he s just a low life scumbag. His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene. You know what they d do.
All right enough! I m tired of thinking about all this!
I ve got a better idea. All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape. We ll set him up somehow.
No.
If you re any friend at all, you ll stop talking like that!
I don t think he s going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son of a bitch! Besides, I m not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
You killed him...
We re doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
Come on. Booth grabs the bag
It was all used. Random numbers. How can they trace it?
Then we re screwed.
We ll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it s marked, there s ways around it.
That s right.
He killed her... he killed her...
He found us, he shot her... he killed her...
No. It stops now. It stops here.
It s NOT too late!
Uh huh.
Why don t you get to the point.
What s your offer, Jesse?
All right, Jesse, we ll play it your way, under one condition.
How much?
Two thousand...
What are you proposing?
None of us like it!
Just take it in stride.
Don t have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Shut up, Jesse.
OKAY! IT S UNDER MY DESK!! TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
No. Why?
You mean that guy was an agent?
What s that?
What for?
Has he?
Hi.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
Nothing.
Oh. You coming by tonight?
Are you sure you re OK?
I m just tired is all. I ll see you tonight OK baby?
Nothing happened?
He s not, he s...
And I d take it out on him.
How the hell did he find it?
Great...
Let s hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I m gonna tell him I returned it all.
I know.
He doesn t slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven t... done anything in over a year.
I hate it when you talk like this. Go on.
I love you Sally.
I m going to quit. That s what has to happen first. Then we re going to tell him.
Shouldn t be long. A couple of weeks maybe.
I m not sure why. It s just, I ve never been anywhere else...
I don t know. My friends...
Yeah, I guess you re right. It s just... all so sudden...
I don t believe it.
What did he buy?
A week ago, at most.
Yeah.
You didn t answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
What?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
Don t worry the real men are in charge now.
That s news to me. So it s over at Jesse s office?
What are you getting at?
Why would someone do that?
Hell no. besides I m just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it s my jurisdiction and all.
Have you known this all along?
Dwayne.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Lingerie...
All right you  re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Vegas! Can you hightail it back here by three o clock?
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don t know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
Well they really didn t go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
So be here at three.
I have complete faith in you. But don t you go speeding.
No. Something wrong with you Dwayne?
What?
I can t hear a word you re saying!
I m saying you re about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Not much to tell. Nothing really happened.
I didn t say that. You did.
Yeah let s hear about your day.
Save me the sermon. I ve heard it all before, it s boring.
Dwayne put the gun down
Dwayne
And if we refuse? Your tampering with evidence isn t exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
What?
Well you re not getting, either.
I was on a roll! I  m a little overextended now.
So I want the money and I want it now.
You re never getting that much.
Give me the bad news.
Anything in it?
There was more than that.
That doesn t tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
So someone did get away.
No, it doesn t. Neither does his blank tape. Any news on that?
I knew it, I knew it all along shit!
I m not getting an answer.
What?? Where d you hear that?
And I got mine, meaning you. Nice how that works out. I m serious this time, I m closing this place down.
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don t cooperate.
Is this about the funny money?
You ve been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning. How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn. Shit don t happen I don t know about.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck but you knew that too, didn t you?
Isabella Molina, from San Juan. That seat is taken.
I don t think so.
This is your ship?
El Capitan?
Well, I m very tempted. It s such a beautiful yacht. What s it called?
The S. S. Minow Johnson. Funny, the name on the back was " Red Dragon. "
I m sure, because this is my friend s yacht. And it s his party.
Throw us in jail? I m about to bust you right now.
We need to get out of sight. Come down to my suite.
So what s your story?
It s much more than a counterfeit. 14 out of 15 world banks can t tell the difference. The paper is Crane linen blend and the bills are printed on U. S. Intaglio presses.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
I said get on your feet!
It s no problem. But I must excuse myself, inspector.
That s right.
No. It s my first time.
Oh yes, she s very nice.
That was my CD. Don t you ever touch a Chinese man s CD.
Those girls drove off because of you.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Don t be giving me attitude, Lee. I ve been here three days and we haven t done shit. We haven t been to a club, haven t even talked to a girl. I m on vacation, and I want some mu shu.
Don t be messing with me, Lee. I will kick your ass. I ll hit you so hard you ll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
No.
No.
Blend in? I m two feet taller than everyone here. Where you going?
I knew you were lying.
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I m just starting to have fun. Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
Tread softly? Who taught you how to roost a bar?
Man, are you crazy? You think that scares me? I m from L. A. We invented gangs. We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it. We get royalties from other gangs. Now gimme your badge and gun and I ll show you how it s done.
You just said you re their worst nightmare and to line their mothers up for a milking.
I m sorry.
How you doin?
She said I could pick any girl I want.
Over there that s Ricky Tan.
This is a very dangerous man.
Back to Heaven on Earth. I need my damn passport back. I m going home.
Why you mad at me? You needed back up, so I backed you up. I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
My bullshit? I m not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I m not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
You re pathetic, man. When s the last time you had some fun? When s the last time you took a night off, had a date?
Really? When s the last time you had some Mu shu Let s hear it, Lee, when was it? Year of the rat?
Who died?
Detective Yu? Never met him.
Who?
I m okay, you go.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman? Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
I ll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Don t be talking about my mama. Or my ass!
No. She s a school teacher.
Good at what?
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
You thought the " Customs Agents get blown up " and " smuggling " and " Ricky Tan " and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That s why you didn t tell me what we were doing...
IT IS CRAZY!
What?
You said
Why LA?
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Almost, but you ve got to say " Rich White Man " all run together like it s one word.
Not bad. Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one. Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Big hotel billionaire. He was on Ricky Tan s boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool. See most white people, when there s shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like " Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming? You people were screaming your asses off.
He just left. Kissed her on the cheek.
How do you know?
Hey, I didn t mean to call you pathetic.
You pull a muscle or something?
I m sorry, Lee. Why did she leave you?
Let me guess, she couldn t handle the cop thing never knowing if you were dead or alive. I ve seen it a million times.
Excuse me?
Just don t fall asleep. Sooner or later something s gonna happen.
What did you say?
Hot? I m freezing my ass off.
Gimme the binoculars.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
Skirt just came off. She s in black bra and panties Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 wait a sec there s a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
What?
What is it?
It s your turn!
There s people up here!
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
She never even looked at you.
I am not third world ugly. Women like me, they think I m cute. Like Snoopy.
What s the first thing I told you never trust nobody. How could you fall for that shit? I knew she was dirty.
Shhh, my head hurts.
Why did you help me?
We are not partners. Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
You got that right. And we ain t brothers. Maybe we should just end this right here.
I won t talk to you, you don t talk to me. We ll die in peace.
I don t believe in reincarnation. So I won t see you in the next world.
I believe in heaven. You people believe in heaven?
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues. They don t let everybody in.
Fine by me.
No.
Mind your own business.
There was no sex. She was very traditional. We were waiting until we were married.
No mu shu.
No kung pao chicken. Never.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings. But only when she was drunk.
Tell me the truth, Carter. Do you think I have a good voice?
I knew it. What does she know. You want me to sing something?
They ll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
It s focus. Every opponent has a weak spot. You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
Who s Benjamin?
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
Yes he did. He also invented the bicycle.
End of the line.
Oh no you don t. Don t you be getting corny on me, Lee. I ll kick your ass from here to Compton.
Wait a second. We can t go in like this. Look at this place, we gotta look fly. We gotta Mac out.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
Dancing?
No. I m going to find out.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
I did!
What?!?!
Carter...
Yes.
I guess so. Thank you, Carter.
About fifty grand. I won it at the tables.
This money is evidence.
New York City?
The Plaza Hotel?
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
I need your help.
Just trying to make it look real.
Why don t you go get them?
How do I know I can trust you?
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
Baby Duck?
The police can protect you.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
Put the plates down. It s over.
Ricky Tan?
I know, Master, but...
Heaven on Earth? Master, I don t understand. A temple, where Heaven is on Earth? A mountain, where Earth reaches for the
Sir, I can explain.
I know, but
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson s ass. Well... you know what I mean.
This is pathetic.
Tell me about it.
You re shittin me. You know the Beach Boys?!
No.
A little.
I didn t say I didn t. You assumed I didn t.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking. You seemed as if you liked to talk. I like to let people talk who like to talk. It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
We are both full of shit.
What?
I was being polite.
Witnesses.
It was not my intent
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
I know a shortcut.
What plate?
No.
Did you make the plate?!
He was trying to kill me, not you.
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Don t go there...
Hey, stop. We re just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you ll start singin Beach Boy songs again. Then I ll really get depressed.
Stooly.
Stool pigeon.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
Yeah, it s good.
Yes, I know this song.
Yes, I think so.
Good God, ya ll!
No, fish is a PM food.
This concrete? This is still America.
I am from outa town.
You drop my gun and you lose my i. d.?
What?
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo. Like I m supposed to drop everything.
No shark fin, no camel hump. What you listenin to?
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn t mean it s yours.
The Feds?!
No... what?
What s wrong with that?
They put you in charge?
Well... listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
Yes I do. That s all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There s no one else I can trust.
This whole thing is goin down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
It s called a dress.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn t we?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
At this point we don t have much.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Sir, he s just gonna get in my way. If I m gonna handle this situation...
Bottom line: I don t want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Because with your special talents, I m sure you ll do a better job.
You think this is funny, Carter? You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
Don t play bullshit games with me.
Why don t you try the assignment. Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
I m not interested, Carter. You re no longer on this assignment.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We ll have to make the first drop at 7. As soon as they pick up the money, we ve got  em.
Sure I do. But the bet defense is a good offense, right? You re not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
Let him come to the wedding. You re not running, right? Say it. " I m not... "
So if you re not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right? All we re doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
I didn t want to find out I wasn t for her in the fourth quarter.
What? You talked to him! Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
And what did you say?
Good one! Thanks.
I m happy here, where I m supposed to be. But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
It s hurting.
Don t be nervous, Maggie. Let us visualize. Remember what Bob said? " Be the ball. "
" Make the shot. "
I left four messages. You don t return my calls.
What?
That s not nothing to do with it. You cooked this story up and you know it.
I already made an appointment for later today.
... Just call me when you have it. Ike, how is the story coming? Is she a man eater?
Look, he s in pretty good shape.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
It wouldn t be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
Okay, you were right. I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
" Paid vindication " That s what I call justice.
This is about her negative attention, not mine. Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
You re coming here?
Then come for dinner.
Then you ll be my best man.
Your job is... the ring. Do you have the ring?!
And end up in the papers? I ve been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you. I m sorry she got you canned.
She s a cacophony of contradictions.
Ah, can t stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
Not bad. I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
I don t think that s why she ran.
And you defending her?
Unbelievable, she got to you.
It s been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
Looking for Maggie.
Not yet. I had a phlemless morning. I hear he s a pretty good ballplayer.
Well, wedding cake freezes. This we know.
Originality is my speciality.
Yes. Conviction. Conviction that I m onto the truth. You re going to do the same thing to " poor bastard number four " that you did to the last three. You re going to run again. And I m not leaving until you do.
We ll see.
Twice...
We think so.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical? Actually, I meant you. You probably got severance or expenses or both. I ll take your check. No credit cards.
Seven fifty.
Six fifty.
I like it. This whole thing is pretty incredible. I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
You afraid to try?
Well, I m impressed. Absolutely incredible. I didn t expect pink and lacy, but this isn t exactly a woman s room.
Highly suspect.
So? Is that what you said to her?
You don t know.
Fine. The newspaper s upside down. That s better than fine.
Of course.
It was in the attic. It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
Can you fix it?
Of what?
Excuse me?
Yes.
You humiliated me!
I had it under control. Now they feel sorry for me.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
Supportive? You weren t being supportive. You were being scared. Just like now. You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
That s right. You re so lost you don t even know how you like your eggs.
With the priest, you liked them scrambled. With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached. Now it s egg whites only, thank you very much.
No, that s called not having a mind of your own. What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon? You don t want to climb Annapuma.
I d rather not.
A little longer for me.
I don t know. I, uh I frankly don t even want to talk about it.
Well, you do have the dress.
And the wedding date. There s the two of us. So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
So am I.
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle? I was walking toward somebody who didn t have any idea who I really was. And it was only half the other person s fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted. So it was good that I didn t go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you you knew the real me.
They re mine. I m turning in my running shoes to you.
I was, because if you said " yes " right away, I wouldn t get to say this next part. And I ve been practicing it. Ready?
I didn t even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
For what reason? Some personal satisfaction?
It s probably because you got him fired.
Where?
Thank you. Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Why?
No, I don t think you re like, " I m charming and mysterious in a way that even I don t understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you ". Very hard to compete with. Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
No. I m weird. Weird and mysterious are two different things.
No. You re quirky. Quirky and weird are two different things.
I think you re right. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Lighten up, what?
I haven t seen him in twenty four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I d feel better if I knew where he was.
Yep. I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
... I don t even want to talk about the luau. What s this?
No, no. I saw eight geese flying in a " V ".
I m just finishing up, too.
No, I m just going to head home.
Wedding. Wedding. You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
Good boy, Port Hole.
Just stop it. Don t say another word like that.
No. It s my life.
Is there somebody else?
You don t love me, is that it?
What am I going to do with a microwave?
He s got a houseboat.
It sounds nice.
Houseboats don t go anywhere.
It s not a boat boat. It s really a house.
It s on the lake right in the middle of Seattle. It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
Who s married to
Because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn t
I hope he doesn t get out his slides.
I love you.
Nope.
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday? Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother I took it inside by accident.
Walter, I d love to
Go for a walk in Central Park
What is it?
Does it have wheat in it?
That doesn t make any sense.
Not for the kind of place I want to do. I won t be in Chicago that long.
And then I ll see you in New York
Ever since Christmas, you ve been different. Kind of distracted, distant. But I feel like you re coming back from wherever you were.
What?
No.
You couldn t.
It was my mother s.
It was a betrayal.
So what happened?
At the top of the Empire State Building
What?
About what?
What was what?
That s what she called him on the show. Because he can t sleep.
Actually, he sounded nice.
They knew it. Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew. It was right. It was real. It was...
" Dear Sleepless and Son... "
I know that. You think I don t know that? " I know that s a dumb way to begin, but it s the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio. On the other hand, maybe I m just losing my mind. "
I m going to marry Walter. I just have to get this out of my system.
I should say something in this about magic.
I don t know. I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
That s impossible. A guy can t
No.
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
I know.
Turn on your radio!
You d probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
That s not what I mean. I m going back over there tomorrow and talk to him. I am.
Becky?
Is this crazy?
Thank you. I love you.
You know that dream where you re walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
So I mailed your letter.
M. F. E. O.?
I m going to run back to Walter s arms, if he s still have me.
No, I m not.
We re going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
I know.
I want my money.
Hi, Jonah. Sam. And who is this?
What?
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married. So we get married.
Annie, when you meet someone and you re attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously. So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
Yes, I did.
Granny s dress. Oh, Mom.
I know. He s wonderful, isn t he?
You ll love them. We re going down to D. C. tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
How amazing.
Destiny takes a hand.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
What?
What?
Magic.
Mom!
Mom, we already...
It s a sign.
Magic.
Hi. So far so good. So. What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school. Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health. What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
It s me?
Grace heard it.
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won t have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
How about rapacious and love starved?
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist
I m not asking you to set me up, Jay. That s not what I need your help for. I want to know what it s like over there.
You mean, like, " He has the cutest butt "? Where did I hear that recently?
Seventy... eight.
I don t think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
What s tira misu?
What is it?
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I m not going to know what it is.
You think so?
Yeah. What s that?
I don t get it.
Nobody knows. It changes practically every day. How much money do you have?
I have forty two. So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Window.
I don t know. Do I?
What is it?
It s a spice rack.
It s never happening again. Right?
It plays in 50 states.
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
Oh, you re changing your mind
What s the matter with this one? Wouldn t you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
P. Dad?
I forgot to mention. Jed called
So I can go.
Shouldn t you have used a toggle bolt?
Stressed.
Thank God. Something you don t know. It s a single white female.
Oklahoma. Do you know where that is?
I m not going to think about what they re not teaching you in school. I am not going to think about it. Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don t live somewhere near here
Dad, you re not taking this seriously.
English muffin. How do you do it?
A slice of pizza
It doesn t. They ask you.
What do you think?
Whose show was this on?
It s nice to meet you, Jessica.
I know.
What was?
You re worried we re going to be all right. We re going to be all right. I remember sometimes you d have nightmares as a baby. Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
Is that what she used to sing?
I don t know.
I never did. Or the whole idea of an afterlife. But I don t know any more. I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway. So what is that? It s sort of an afterlife, isn t it?
I look stupid. I look stupid, don t I? I look like I m trying too hard. I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I d look like I just got a haircut.
The heels on these shoes are very large. Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Not now, Jonah
Jonah, I m leaving
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
She doesn t want us to go to Baltimore. She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine s Day. On top of the Empire State Building.
It s only ten o clock.
Okay.
Thanks for dinner. I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
I was thirsty.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
No.
I just called for a second.
It s a short word.
Was Mom an adjustment?
Who is Annie?
Are you going with her?
Thank you, Jonah. But the point is, I am not asking permission.
This conversation is finished.
Did not.
I can t know what I said, but we re not going.
Get out.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
If I didn t go.
No.
Okay.
Yes, I do. In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don t we all go next week?
What about it?
I went camping once. I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Well...
Hi. Sam?
Thanks, but... we ve got plans.
Move on. Right. That s what I m going to do. In a few months, boom, I ll be fine, I ll just grow a new heart.
It ll take him a while to come around. A month ago he called one of those radio call in shows and told them I needed a wife
What do you mean?
Would you follow her through an airport?
You did?
You could have called me
You are the first woman I m going out with.
I know her pretty well. Maybe I could call her
No. After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry. He had an uncanny sense of timing. We really shouldn t do anything here anyway.
He s good at it.
I read the same article...
Absolutely. When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own. What do you think?
Why didn t you give a warning signal?
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
No thanks.
How s it going?
Whose side are you on anyway?
I ve tried everything but shootin ' em down.
You want em all arrested?
It s the paymaster from Moscow with our gold.
The woman question?
So? What does he want to do about em?
What do you mean sex equality?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We re taking it up with the Super.
You work alone, savvy? You can t handle the job, I ll find someone who can.
You weren t even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me...
No, Estellita.
They are singing for me.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
What?
What s more important than sanitation?
I see. The men. You ll strike, maybe, for your demands but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
All right. Have your strike. I ll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I ll be a striker s wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we ll get behind on the payments again, and then they ll come and take away the radio...
Never... never... never!
I m a fool.
Antonio paid for it.
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
They say I am no good to you.
What makes you so sure?
Over my dead body.
But it s yours. I won t let them...
No.
The union don t run my house. Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves but you don t see any of them down there.
She s the organizer s, wife. She s got to be there.
There s Jenkins wife. You don t see her on no picket line.
Can be what?
Yes.
I m okay. But it s nice to be home.
All right, but later. I ve got a meeting now.
You weren t waiting for me.
Be still...
We can t go on this way. I just can t go on living with you. Not this way.
Hunting.
Sun up.
No.
Why not? I m not needed here.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand by for the funeral.
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out even if it takes another two, three months. What s it to them if the mine s shut down a little longer?
Aah! They ve got other mines. You don t see the larger picture. They ve got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
Like what?
Charley Vidal says! Don t throw Charley Vidal up to me!
I don t know what you re talking about.
You talk of dignity? After what you ve been doing?
Will you be still?
What are you saying?
But honey...
Look who s talking! The Great White Father, and World s Champion of Women s Rights.
Then why s the company hanging tough? They ve signed contracts with other locals why not this one?
Exactly. And equality s the one thing the bosses can t afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, " Well at least you get more than the Mexicans. "
Well, you re the organizer. You work out strike strategy and most of the time you re dead right. But when you figure everything the rank and file s to do down to the last detail, you don t give us anything to think about. You afraid we re too lazy to take initiative?
You mean Delaware?
New York? You re not the Company President by any chance?
Too bad. The men ve always wanted to get a look at the President. But you ve come out here to settle the strike?
It s possible. Just negotiate.
I thought maybe you forgot...
The what!
Don t I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
You ve got to help around the house!
You... You... I d expect it of an Anglo, yes... but you...
You Judas... blood sucker...
T ! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
What attitude?
He s a guest in my house, isn t he?
That s it?
No.
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain t that dirty. Just kinda filthy is all.
Yeah.
Not even a guess?
How about in the house?
Did you see his hair color?
You like that?
First rate, ain t it?
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
Now that s down right insulting.
Everything go?
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won t like any surprises
Leave me out of this.
This man sounds like a real catch.
Nothing.
Look, it s really none of my business but why don t you just dump this guy?
Don t tell me, down deep he s really not a bad person and you don t want to see him get hurt.
Then leave.
Why not?
There s nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
You get off on abuse or something?
Then why don t you leave? Just give me one good reason.
Why? They don t hold him for more than a day or two.
What happened to your eye?
Don t worry. He s out of town.
Never heard of him.
Like you?
And you admire that?
Nothing.
I don t want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
This has nothing to do with him.
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
What is wrong with you?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
You don t like the tune, find another station.
It s me.
What about a battered woman s shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
You can still work.
Ass first into the world.
They would have killed you too.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
Why?
I don t want to leave you.
That s when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
I m fine. Little nervous... little disappointed that I didn t finish this myself.
What?
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
You ve got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can t keep hiding.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
It s not too late to show her you re sorry.
Twelve
I know a guy.
I hadn t noticed. I ve seen you around. What s your name?
Why s that?
You don t say.
You on a roll?
Sorry.
I m serious, dude. You always seem to be on top of things, even when you re tweakin.
Business. I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
You. You re smooth. You use words like dire and shit. You got language skills, man.
Yeah, Pooh Bear. Dude is a big time cook. I m talking dire.
Can your man handle that?
Can you set that up?
You mean, like to throw em off?
Palmdale
I think on account of his nose.
He doesn t have one.
Sure, Jimmy.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Yes, Jimmy.
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare. It s for you.
Wait till I tell you what it is.
When? When did you ever see me use?
I can t tell you.
I don t trust anybody.
That was my idea.
What does that mean?
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Crank or glass?
No, I m good.
Make me an offer.
I deal in U. S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Anything for a dear friend.
If you say so.
Why do you say that?
Hey, I was just trying to...
Pull your pants down.
Please.. I don t know what you re...
Don t do that. Please. Or I ll kill you. Please, Danny.
Just some buddies.
You go, boy.
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
Never mind. Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Hard to compare the people you re taking down with the Lord.
It s not my place.
Just the way the world works. Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren t a bad guy. You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
When?
Question is, what are you doing here?
Cut the shit, Flynne.
This chink have a name?
Whata you mean I ve got no choice?
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
News flash, Tanner. I m a fucking rat.
Whata you mean? He told me
What s to stop him from just ripping me off then?
I m afraid so, Danny.
Jesus.
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
Yeah. What about him?
To who?
What?!
Who the hell is Jimmy?
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy... goes by the name of Pooh Bear. He s a chef. Check with Palmdale P. D. I m sure they re keeping box scores on the guy.
That would be me.
Lay off, Garcetti. I m not in the mood.
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Funny, I don t feel lucky.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Again, I thank you.
And you ve got wiener breath.
There s no motels around here.
Come on, where s your pioneer spirit?
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to? And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
What do you mean?
I wanted you to ask back there. You know, before you got us lost.
Just admit you re wrong.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
What is it, drugs?
Don t worry about it.
You writin a book or somethin?
In West Fork?
No kidding.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
The Army gave you that?
You must be a hell a shot.
Forty two hundred, I figure.
You got somethin against the Cap n?
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft. Back home, we go out squirrel huntin, I walk forever and a day and then some, don t even raise a blister.
Shut up, will you?
Just shut up, Ryan didn t kill Wade.
Reiben, are you makin fun a the way I talk?
I think I m we got that eighty eight.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you re from Tennessee.
You didn t volunteer, Jackson.
I d love to hear it.
Yes, sir. It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany. Now I ain t one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God given talent.
In the shadow by those two trees.
Sir, I ain t feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
You ll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve. There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he s been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Say what, Cap n?
Don t that get kind of expensive, Cap n?
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
It was nothing.
Pass.
Yes. Do you know Sibelius Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
I heard.
You know classical music?
I ll tell you what, if I m still alive when it hits five hundred, I ll let you know and we ll split the money.
Don t need it, I m a cat, I ve got five lives.
What do they know? I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out. Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud. I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
Those are Tigers, they have six inch armor, they don t even notice grenades.
Sure, you got one?
But, sir...
Goddamn it, sir...
You tryin to get yourself killed?
I wish. You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
Simpson.
I want Reiben on B. A. R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
Okay, Wade. Translators?
What about Talbot?
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
Hell of a mission.
PUSH!
Maybe.
Since when have things been normal?
Nope.
They re fine. As long as they can gripe, they ll be alright.
Nope.
Three for three.
You re kidding yourself.
Now you re the one kidding yourself. Hell of a mission.
Is it getting worse?
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn t seem to agree with you anymore.
How about I go right, sir?
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Vecchio.
Yeah.
Bits and pieces.
And what about your own hand?
It could be worse. You know the first thing they teach you at O. C. S.? Lie to your men.
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don t have good morale, it s not worth a damn. So if you re scared or empty or half a step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men? Of course not. You bluff, you lie.
Simple, numbers. Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty one on the cliffs? I ll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns. That s over three hundred men. Maybe five hundred. A thousand. Then thousand. Any number you want. See? It s simple. It lets you always choose mission over men.
That s the rub. I liked Wade. Who s Ryan? If they re both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose? Look at my hand, there it goes again.
I think you re right, Keith.
I know.
You re welcome, John.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream colored, shear body negligees with gentle lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Please, sir, you can t take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it s beautiful, it s the best there is, it s... oh, please, sir...
No, I m not, Kaback is, honest. Or what about Faulkner? Or that little guy with the glasses?
Sure, Reiben.
Yeah, how so?
There s to be a bright side, look for it.
There s always a bright side.
Sure, what do you want to know?
Ours is not to reason why.
Never mind, don t worry, we ll pick up this kid, high tail it back to division, everything ll work out fine.
Reiben, there s a fairly good chance you re not going to die at all.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
Yes, sir, as a final note, I d like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we re at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
Why s that?
Except for the last part, that one s not bad.
I don t like that one.
But we accomplish the mission.
Has anyone ever told you, you re officer material?
What if our guys open up, sir?
HERE THEY COME!
Here they come.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
And Sarge?
That s because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we re in a cranberry bog.
I care. Don t you know what Caen s famous for, Sarge?
Lingerie.
We know.
Goddamn it... Goddamn it... Goddamn it...
Twenty four five.
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients. We ve been investigating him for five years. We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
Look, why don t you check it out for yourself? See if your father fits the profile.
Well, take a look around the house. Is everything nice, but not too nice? Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash? Does he give a lot of gifts? Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand dollar range?
Don t let your father s business infect your life.
Because he s guilty.
Is it a gift for your wife? Are you getting a set together?
For going to school?
Good for her.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
You re sure?
Hey, sis.
I hope you understand.
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Jesus Christ. I get in a good mood. How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
Look, I m really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really. If it s such a big deal, I ll go. But remember this, it used to be fun. It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I m sorry T I M left you. But I am not T I M.
Yeah.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
Yes I did I sat across from her in a mall. We ate together. We ate, that s eating, sharing an important physical event.
What s a scam?
I m gonna call her.
Lloyd, give it up.
Lloyd.
C mon Lloyd.
That s just so embarrassing.
Hang in there, man.
See you tomorrow.
Lloyd, listen to me. EVERYTHING has changed. You ve had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two. You might be sixty. You might be walking down the street, and you ll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you ll really be thinking is We had sex.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter. Something.
I am.
Come on, it s graduation.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
Meaning?
Look at his face, he did the deed.
You ve got to show her respect, you ve got to show her that you re not like Joe...
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
What? I m sorry, talk.
I just saw Joe. He s here.
It s too much pressure, it s not his crowd.
I m not going back there. I don t even know who you re talking about.
Ha! Go back! What a great line!
Oh yeah!
Oh no, no, it s... it s wonderful. It s... no, don t worry about it. You re very funny. Go back, that s great!
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it s yours. Go ahead, open it.
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn t know me. I mean, maybe I shouldn t have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
Everybody thinks I m a priss.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
I love you dad.
I just had a phone call.
No, no, just listen. You won the Wreath fellowship.
You won it. You re going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
Dad, I m so glad I went. Goodnight.
Lloyd was such a gentleman. He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it. I called him basic. Can you believe I did that?
Dad.
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
Okay, I give up.
Dad, I m sorry.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
Dad, I m so sorry. I know this is a bad time.
I m fine.
Dad, yes. And I m scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
You re going.
You re going.
Bon voyage.
Diane! Alright, let s stop this right now. Let s not put our energy into something ridiculous. This isn t even smart thinking.
I like him a lot.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change. People change.
' I like him? Diane, I m talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Dad, did you do it? Did you take that money?
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Swear to god.
But I found the money.
What am I supposed to think?
You stole from them, you lied to me. How do you think that s supposed to make me feel?
Yes, I...
No, but you stole from them.
You let me believe you. You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it. God, how... how could you...
I trusted you. I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
No. I told you everything, you lied to me. I would have done anything for you.
No, I will. I don t want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you. You re a liar, and a thief.
I m so ashamed dad.
Hi.
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it s not the greatest. I see you so seldom, I d really rather know about you.
You know, I don t even know if you ve got a young man in your life?
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier. You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Alright.
Hi. You called me?
Yeah?
Thank you very much.
Yeah. What a day.
Yeah.
Yes, we sat together at Bell s Square.
No, I read it on the message.
Oh, thanks, but I m busy.
Yes. Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
Well, not monumentally.
Hmmm....
No tips. I won t give you any tips of any kind.
Pardon me?
Eight.
Goodbye.
Would you hold this for me?
They re Bavarian Death style pretzels.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can t. I have to keep their keys.
Mine say stuff like " Lloyd, see you around maybe "
They knew of you. Now they know you.
That s cool then.
Yeah, but that s an old story, you don t want to hear it.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them. So I chose my dad. It just felt safer that way, you know?
Twisted?
What?
Basic. Hmmm.
Job? Being a great date.
So am I. I want to see you again. I want to see you as much as I can before you leave. I said it.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Today is tomorrow.
Yeah?
You think so?
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
I know you think my job is strange. You don t like old people, do you?
Come on.
Okay, bye, I will.
Okay.
What did you say?
I just don t want it to get too heavy. I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things. But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don t know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don t know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling? Do you know what I mean?
I just can t have any social life right now.
Be friends?
Yeah.
I m doing alright.
Yeah?
Am I wrecking my car?
Yeah.
This is so noble.
Yes. Are you shaking?
You re shaking.
You re cold.
Then why are you shaking?
Your letter came yesterday.
Uh huh. It was wonderful.
It was wonderful.
No, we don t have to say it.
I don t know what you re going to say, but I think that...
I know. Lloyd, let s not start putting things on this level.
How can I look at you and say this?
What s wrong?
You need to study?
Okay, how much time do you need? I mean, you know, I mean you ll be leaving in a little while, so that s answered some questions.
Okay. It s good knowing this.
We decided...
No, no.
No. We decided that we re friends. I mean, I know it s a terrible word...
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
No, I don t, I don t.
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
No I didn t.
No.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
No, that s fine. She ll tell everybody, but that s fine.
Just my dad.
You have Corey and DC. I have my dad.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
Don t be mean, this is hard for me too.
I m sorry.
My father s guilty. He lied to me, he lied to everybody. I just left home... I need you.
Everything else means nothing to me. If I hurt you again, I ll die.
I love you.
I love you. How many more times do I have to say it?
Alright, high level air safety tips. If anything happens, it ll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
So when you hear the smoking sign go ding, you know everything s going to be okay.
Right, I m just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey. Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
Nobody thought we d do this. Nobody really thinks it s going to work, do they?
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
He s back. Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your Hey Soul Classics?
Hello. May I please speak with Diane please?
Uh... okay... um...
No.
No.
Okay. She s really pretty great, isn t she?
She s really pretty great, isn t she?
Okay. Good afternoon. Goodbye.
Hello Lloyd.
Fine Lloyd.
How do you pay for one of those?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
I m totally and completely serious.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
Are you?
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride. You know, my daughter s a lot different to you.
She s very successful.
Very talented.
You re not a permanent part of her life. You re a distraction.
I know this part, keep reading.
It does, it does if it s the version signed I still can t help loving you. Read that.
So what s up?
Hey.
What?
Yeah.
I called her up.
I m Lloyd Dobler.
How you doin, brother?
You know Diane Court?
A very responsible young man you re out with tonight.
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I don t know.
Maybe we ll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
You must chill! You must chill! I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
Itzhak Stern? He s on the list.
He s on the list. If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He s on the list. You can t have him.
Sir, the list is correct.
Oskar, please
I don t have to like her just because you do. It doesn t work that way.
I m sorry to hear that.
In Breslau.
They re not gone, they re here.
We re going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter
Yeah, what s that?
He s important to my business.
What s going on?
They re taking mine. When I said they didn t have a future I didn t mean tomorrow. Auschwitz.
It s good business.
Look
It s good for me I know them, I m familiar with them. It s good for you you ll be compensated. It s good for the Army. You know what I m going to make? Artillery shells. Tank shells. They need that. Everybody s happy.
I just told you.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
I need a drink.
We re losing the war, aren t we.
Pistols?
No, look. It s the others. They re the ones causing these delays.
So I ll talk to him about it.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that s why this one s for sale.
The Jewish worker s salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
Yes.
Yes.
Christmas presents.
Are you losing money?
What other point is
And killing.
I think it s too late.
They re withholding payment.
You don t? I do. I see a difference.
There will be generations because of what you did.
I lost a day of production. I lost a worker. I expect to be compensated.
Would it do any good?
I live here.
I had to change. Did anyone call?
Can we talk?
Look, yesterday wasn t my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
You could start with an apology.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I ve become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
Did it?
What?
It  s over, Cotton.
You have a right to be angry.
Cotton, I ve done nothing but help you.
What s your subject?
" And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY. "
Not one bit.
She dumped me.
Yeah.
I skipped. Too many " That s her " looks.
Let us decide that.
No, it s not.
It s not you, Derek. I don t trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
No. This is a set up.
So you ll relieve me at 2: 30...
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
What guy?
I really don  t like that comparison, honey.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
You  d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It  s a whole world, Sid. You  re really popular amongst the demented.
The way I see it. We  ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
We  re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy / Stu thing  s been done.
And we didn  t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money  s worth.
Or it found us.
Just for you, Sid.
Miss Weathers.
I see you read the book.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Oh Dewey, I m sorry.
Page 41. " Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience. "
Mood swing. I m manic depressive.
I think you re all an act.
I know that.
Meaning?
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
What are we looking for?
Can we turn the light on?
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
.. and as lonely as I am...
And Joel s pre med.
Shit! It s both of them. The first murders were to throw us using the same names as Woodsboro. But they ve moved on they re getting closer to Sidney. They re not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They re looking for the new Tatum.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
They don t know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
Yeah, right.
Don t worry...
Just in case...
Dewey, there s no such place.
I m okay. PEOPLE magazine won t stop calling but other than that...
Yeah, well... you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie s getting good reviews.
It s hell week. I m pledging the Deltas.
Are you in danger now?
Where is your attacker?
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
Sig Ep s gotta band, tonight.
Don t do this.
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Gotta.
It s okay. Look, Hallie, I ll meet you outside.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don t go together. Trust me.
Her old boyfriend?
Easy black boy.
You re not allowed to ask that.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
.. we only promote safe rubbered sex.
.. harmonica style is okay.
It ll be okay, baby, I ll hold your hand.
But...
Shush.
I m sorry, I m sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
I get scared really easy, okay.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
Listen to me. We ve got to get help. The Killer s here.
I m sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I m stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I m just stupid. Please, Sid, don t be mad at me.
Well, yeah... she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I m sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I m fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
I guess Gale s going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
Nah I think it s doing so damn well because one of it s players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
Melinda McGraw?
Look, I m stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don t want you to start freaking if I don t get there at exactly, Eight thirty.
Oh I wouldn t miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Hello.
I don t know.
Do I?
Wait, wait. Don t hang up.
Well ya got me. That s me. I m Ben Damon.
Thanks.
More of a game really.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here s how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
That s right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we re taking the game to a whole new level. Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I ll have your girlfriend. We ll be waiting.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Closer than you think.
To see your reaction.
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
It may be Maureen Reynolds
Well it s not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
I figured I d be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about. Now where s this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Help me Sid! The killer s got me!
Sid I can see you!
They ve got her!
Don t worry Sid I d never leave you like that.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn t need you Gale.
Uh huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid s mom. Dewey, whether we like it or not it looks like we re going to have to go back into our past.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation s attention to this shit anyway. I ll be damned if I m gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Yes. Look, let s get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I m out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.! What about you?
You said you d never leave Woodsboro, The only place that s real! But now you re here. Not with me. Dewey, I took care of you. I waited until you were well. I couldn t stay there, I mean, it s like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
It was fucking 60 Minutes II! I couldn t say no! I could ve been the next Diane Sawyer!
It didn t work Dewey. We tried, we re different.
Dewey, you re not just here because of that second rate K Mart, straight to video version of me, are you?
All of what Dewey? You do know something, don t you?
Always.
And?
Someone stole Sid s file?
I m sorry, this is too good!
Right. Sorry. Do you think he did it?
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
Neither are you, Magnum P. I.
What?
Oh. Yeah, I guess I do.
Do you want us to come with you?
No point, I m just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
But you know who she was.
It s a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way. Honestly though, tell us, what s your favorite scary movie?
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What s wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
I know right. It was kinda weak. That s cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
What s your favorite scary movie Gale?
What the hell are you doing?
I am Gale Weathers!
None.
And as a sane person. For you that must be quite a stretch.
Need to get in that building?
There a story in that building?
Really, you know you d make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It d put a smile on my face everytime I m down.
Milton s not a killer. He s a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack off parties he has with his two best friends.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Yeah.
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It s dead and buried. Daddy took ol Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
It was in the 70 s, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression. Nothing happened to her that she didn t invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That s a shocker.
Heh, well, that s TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
Let s get out of here!
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Wait a second Sid. Don t you go jumping the gun. You haven t seen the best part. With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI ve been able to steal your voice. Ain t it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Sarah, it s Roman, I m sorry I m running late, I m still on the 405, I m about 10 minutes away.
What character? I m Candy, the chick who gets killed second. I m only in two scenes!
I m not happy that I m 35 playing a 21 year old. I m not happy that I have to die naked! And I m not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend s been cut into McNuggets.
Huh, fine.
Page 22.. Ring ring. Hello?
Who s this?
This is Candy. Hang on, let me get some clothes. See! I don t understand why I have to start the scene in the shower! The whole shower things been done, Vertigo hello! And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
Whatever. Come on, who is this? I think you have the wrong number.
I m hanging up right now.
Roman that s not the line.
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there s a new script every 15 minutes?
What? What movie?
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY S LIVING ROOM NIGHT. " What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident ".
Make up. You need it. Hey, Roman isn t here?
W what do you want?
You sick fuck I m tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
No. You didn t kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
The final act? Well let s play asshole!
Who is this?
Yes.
How do I know their voices are
She d have been so happy, Sidney, to know we d be together.
You re doing real good. Can t you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
Yes, hi I m Laura, I m a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Are you sure?
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
I m sorry, your voice.
Who the fuck is this?
It s called tact, you fuckrag.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
Piece of cake. She ll be there.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
It s an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong you die.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
I m sorry. Don t hate me.
Now that it s out of your system.
Oh it did?
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump bump.
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
The police say I scared him off. It wasn t me, Sid.
See, it couldn t have been me. I was in jail, remember?
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
It s been a year since she died.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She s not coming back.
So... I m sorry. I ve been a selfish shit and I m sorry.
You lost your mom...
Oh Sidney...
Sure it does. It s like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Or even a good porno.
Are you serious?
What?
I called my dad.
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
You don t still think it was me?
Fuck you.
Stop it!
Who is this?
What number is this?
I don t know.
Do I?
I m sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
To apologize.
I want to talk to you for a second.
Why don t you want to talk to me?
You tell me your name, I ll tell you mine.
You re making popcorn?
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
Really? What?
Do you like scary movies?
Guess.
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Freddy that s right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
I want to now who I m talking to.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Don t hang up on me.
I told you not to hang up on me.
To talk.
You getting scared?
Sure...
I m getting scared.
I believe you...
That all depends on you.
No...
NOOO!
Come on. It ll be fun.
It s an easy category. Movie trivia.
I ll even give you a warm up question.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Come on, yes you do.
NOOOO....
Please go away! Leave us alone!
No it s not. It was Jason.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
What?
I know who you are, ma am. How s the eye?
You re not supposed to be here, ma am.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
We re tracking the cellular phone bill.
No, not yet.
Am I keeping you? I m sorry.
Deputy... good evening.
You never know when or where a story will break.
Then what are you doing here?
What kind of lead?
I d love to. If you re sure it s alright?
Can I bring Kenny?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
Nah... it s just this town s way of not taking me serious.
Sidney s father?
Oh, God, Sid, I m sorry I was late.
Sorry, police orders. I ll stay out of the way, I promise.
You re sure it was the Hilton?
He s not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
Somebody called me, Dewey. I m not making it up.
Yeah.
Afraid not.
What is it? Where s Casey?
When did that ever stop you? You can t sit on this. This is huge.
But it s so much easier when we make it up.
What s the delay?
Just stay back.
Your mother s murder was last year s hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They re gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Has his story changed?
He s lying. She wouldn t have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
I saw him leaving wearing it.
Why would she lie about it?
And why would she do that?
Scary night, isn t it? With the murders and all, it s like right out of a horror movie or something.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
What s your favorite scary movie?
And why is that?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
So who are you?
So where are you?
Uh huh.
LEAVEMEALONE!
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Working, thank you.
Don t shoot. It s me.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
I m gonna gut your ass in a second.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
Yeah, I m off early curfew you know. Now that s poor taste.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn t do anything.
The why d the police let him go?
There s always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That s the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it s too complicated you lose your target audience.
Maybe Sidney wouldn t have sex with him.
Could be. Now that Billy s tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
Because he s probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they d watch PROM NIGHT they d save time. There s formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone s always a suspect the father, the principal, the town derelict...
And what would be your motive?
He came to make up.
Wanna another beer?
Are you serious?
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Why are you doing this?
The official term is " psychotic ".
No way.
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
Do they know who did it?
They think it s school related?
No prob. I ll pick you up after practice.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
I ll be there by seven. I promise
It s past seven.
I m not worried.
Whatever. Just hurry.
Just like old times, ain t it?
He was there, Tatum.
I bet he s pissed.
I don t know...
So you think my mom was a slut too?
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn t prove it in court?
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
And you believe it?
Don t go there, Sid. You re starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don t freak yourself out we ve got a long night ahead of us.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother s untimely death. It s no big deal. You ll thaw out.
Grant Goodeve the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing " Eight is enough to fill our lives with love... " He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. " Eight is enough to fill our lives with love... " It s a real turn on.
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you re pushing.
For once, Stu, drop it.
What am I? The beer wench?
Give it to me.
Thank you.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns? There must be something to connect him with a past.
Announcing what?
So what? This victim...
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins. But, this was a fat guy. The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time. It s like the fashionable thing to do.
This can t be my last duty here. It will go on and on.
No, I haven t heard.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
Yeah.
I ll get a job, maybe on a farm. I ll work on the house.
What are you talking about?
I heard.
It s always been like this.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
David... please...
Wanting people to pay attention, you can t just tap them on the shoulder. You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
Not me. I m not special. I m not exceptional. This is, though. What I m doing.
You know that s not true.
Spit it out.
Well, I ll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done. Wouldn t want to miss it.
Now... I wouldn t do something like that, Johnny. I like you. I like you a lot.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off. That s all.
Murderers?
Murderers like you?
Delusions of grandeur.
And, why is that?
We would have gotten you eventually.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
What the fuck is going on?
Since we re just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile. After that, we ll...
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone. I can t help wondering... why here?
All this effort you ve made to get transferred, it s the first question that pops into my head.
Maybe I m not understanding the question.
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there. I don t know. Look, it d be great by me if we didn t start right off kicking each other in the balls. But, you re calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
I wasn t standing around guarding the local Taco Bell. I ve worked homicide for five and a half years.
I realize that.
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn t really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
No one yet.
What?
Is there any blood in it?
No.
Good.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene. I can t worry whether you think you re getting enough time on the playing field.
Okay... sure... It s just that, with my old partner, you know...
I m invited to have a late supper at your house. And, I accept.
What about sports?
I read. Remember reading?
I m certain. He was the biggest defense lawyer around. Infamous, actually.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday. The murderer would want Gould to take his time. To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut? There s a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
And, if it s a threat.
Punishing.
Like in the Parson s Tale, and Dante.
Yeah. Parts of them. Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
Right. But there, pride comes first, not gluttony. The sins are in a different order.
Forced what?
Nothing.
I know.
It doesn t fit. He doesn t want us to help him stop.
And you don t?
Then, you tell me what you think we re doing.
Oh, that s all.
Bullshit.
I ve seen the same. I m not the country hick you seem to think I am.
Doesn t seem like our man, does it?
He doesn t have the desire somehow. Our killer seems to have more purpose. More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
Yes. They were there... so, it must be.
Never took a bullet. I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
I expected it to be bad, you know. I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night. I never gave it a second thought.
I want him bad. I don t just want to catch him anymore. I want to hurt him.
No kidding! No fucking kidding!
I don t know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
A landlord s dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
This is the job. It s not an Easter egg hunt.
It s too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can t make that mistake.
It s a fine line between insane and inspired.
No.
No. He s not depending on luck. You ve seen that. We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day. To the day! Because he wanted us to.
And so what?
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn t make him Einstein.
Him?
What? Assessing fines?
You got to be kidding.
How is this legal?
If you want to know who s been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau s computer will tell you. It might give us a name.
Yeah, well... at least we re out of the office. We ve got pizza.
We re focusing.
It s not what you think it is.
That is.
That s what it says. Jonathan Doe.
We ll take a look at him. Talk to him.
You do the talking. Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
I m fine.
It was him.
We need a warrant.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Think it through. If we leave a hole like this, we ll never prosecute. He ll walk. We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
Then, he must write about these murders.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
If we get him, I ll be happy enough.
How can you say that? Especially after today?
You re the oldest man I know, Somerset.
You do your job...
You follow the law and do the best you can. It s all there.
People don t want a champion. They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
It wasn t one thing, if that s what you mean. I just... I can t live here anymore. I can t live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
Wrong! I sympathize completely, because if you can t win... then, if you don t ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe. It s easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love. You just have to make sure you don t stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you ll risk being sad. Keep ignoring.
No I m not! I m talking about common, everyday life here. If you let yourself worry about one thing, you ll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn t just bliss, it s a matter of survival.
One of two things will happen. We re either going to get John Doe, or he ll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement. He wouldn t just stop.
Well, I have to tell you... I think I ve fallen in love with you.
Kiss me on the lips.
Wait!
Don t do this... please...
I don t know why... why now?
I don t see anything.
What?
Oh... um, William.
High school and college, yes. Pretty hokey, huh? I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry. God... he was the funniest man I d ever met.
It surprises me. It really does.
It s a hard place.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
Talk to him about it. He ll understand if you tell him how you feel.
You should look into private schools.
I want to have children. It s just...
Did the wife confess?
Crime of passion.
How should I know?
An she s got a beau! Kisses him, too!
What, Ben?
It was, I tell you!
She sure is!... An don t think your comin back is goin to change it!
What right you got to be talkin marriage to any decent woman...
This un come a long way fore he died.
No sir... pleasure.
Dunno... Seems so.
He sure is goin... He s sworn in.
I m askin as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
You fit a lot of descriptions.
Amen!... Put an amen to it!
... as you have of findin those girls alive by ridin into em... I say we do it my way, Ethan... and that s an order!
That s all right, Captain... I don t need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
How many, would you say?
Sir?
Yes, sir... Troop s about ten miles back... The Colonel sent me looking for you...
God forbid... No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we re at... and where he s at...
All right... But keep your eye on me, boy... I m the hard case you re up against here not these childish savages... If you don t hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind... I don t aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
You lie! All white men lie... and kill...
I remember... from always... At first I prayed to you... come and get me... Take me home... You didn t come...
Ain t been too good... No sir, not too good... Gettin old, Ethan...
Don t want no money, Ethan... jus a place a roof over m head... a little grub... a bunk to sleep in... an a rockin chair by the fire... my own rockin chair by a fire...
Swear it, Ethan?... Given word?
Ay eh... Made out I was crazy... Ate dirt... chewed grass... I fooled em, Ethan!... an I got away...
You said there d be a thousand dollar reward.
A young buck fetched it in late last summer... Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
Me neither... But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
Scar s band was headin north... to winter in at Fort Wingate... eatin agency beef. That s what this buck said... Maybe he lied.
Cheyenne! What Cheyenne?
Keefer!.. Put this man under arrest!
Stop callin me uncle... I ain t your uncle.
Name s Ethan... Now what s so mighty fishy about this trail?
Why, sure, Ethan... There s just the one thing we re after... finding Deborah and Lucy...
Sorry... We don t even know if Debbie n Lucy are with this bunch... Maybe they split up...
I ain t stayin... I set out lookin for Debbie... I aim to keep on...
Because she s my... my...
I always felt like she was... Her folks takin me in, raisin me like one of their own...
All right... I ain t got no kin... I m goin to keep lookin that s all.
Yeah... you want me to know I ain t got no kin no money no horses nothing but a dead man s clothes to wear!.. You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Oh...
He just couldn t wait...
But I just bought a good blanket.
What?
Oh no! Tell her she s got to go back...
She ain t goin back to her family, that s certain... not if she took off where the arrow points.
Nine... Ten!
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
Never heard of him...
He s got to... All these years, run nin, dodgin, knowin we were after him... Now we caught up... It s him or us.
Not no more.
Livin with Comanches ain t bein alive...
Not far from it...
There s one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff... trade goods... Couldn t help noticing that most of it was Mexican... Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border... What do they call themselves?
That s the breed... Course it might take time.
From the beginning...
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
Well I ain t one of em!
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
Finish your breakfast...
Go on then! Pa s in the barn saddlin the Fort Worth stud... an you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
One letter in five years... I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
No, it wasn t... You mighta said you loved me... You mighta asked me to wait... At least that d have been something...
You crazy?
I got to fetch her home...
Laurie! Shut your mouth!
We got two around that age...
You ll have to wait until we reach the agency... Fall in behind the column...
You re not a doctor, you ll hurt him!
They say it s fantastic. At least that s what I read in a men s magazine. So who are the two lucky ones?
It still worked in town.
We ll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Do you have a better idea?
You?
We just have to make a new beginning.
What?
Not a book fair. I was signing autographs in a department store.
So do I, believe me.
Maybe different. I don t know, Ellen.
What? What am I supposed to sense?
Old?! Come look at this! She has wounds. Wounds on her head. Like thrashes. Or bites.
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
It s a pleasure. You re from the city, right?
Tenth floor.
And the title of this piece?
It s good.
The title won t do.
Romeo and Juliet just a suggestion.
Yes.
Really?
Lady?
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
You have the money?
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Twenty pounds on delivery
Romeo? he gave it to Henslowe.
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral s Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
Romeo
It s for Henslowe. He paid me.
Ten pounds.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
I have lost my gift. It s as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
Nothing comes.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
On my mother s side the Ardens
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
Yes, I saw it.
That s me.
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity s sake.
Put his feet in.
Cut his nose off.
And his ears.
Partners!
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate s Daughter.
A share of the profits.
Of course not!
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
Oh, that.
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business. The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
Nothing. Strangely enough, it all turns out well.
Very well.
It will be all right, madam.
Who are you?
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
It is all locked safe in here
She is always Aphrodite.
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
What piece? Richard Crookback?
Who wrote that?
Fifty pounds? What for?
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
I did not.
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
What? Who?
The one who came with your letter?
No, it will turn out well.
What do we do now?
Go on.
How will it?
How goes it, Will?
Burbage says you have a play.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
I love your early work. " Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium? "
Good title.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate s Daughter. Yes, I know.
Well, there s a pirate In truth, I have not written a word.
Yes, that s good. Until he meets
Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
When the Queen commands it.
I am not so well born.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father s fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
No... not the artful postures of love, but love that over throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play. I will have love or I will end my days as a...
Verona again.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps s dreaming.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
And I love poetry above all.
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play house go make your farewell and send her out. It s time to settle accounts. How much was the wager?
I have lost my gift.
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
I am, Master Shakespeare.
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
Luck be with you, Sam. Sam ?
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
You have opened the playhouses?
But the plague
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate s daughter.
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
Who is there?
The same, alas.
A lowly player.
If they find you here they will kill you.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
There is.
Oh
I must. Look how pale the window.
No, the morning rooster woke me.
Mr. Henslowe?
Oh no, no!
It is broad day! The rooster tells us so!
That s my line!
Oh, but it will end well for love?
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
You never spoke so well of him.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
Oh, my love You ran from me before.
You cannot marry Wessex!
" Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day  It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. "
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
Orsino  good name
How does it?
Nor you for me.
My lord.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
You flatter, my lord.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
I do not love you, my lord.
Virginia?!
But why me?
The Queen has consented?
It is not my riding day, my lord.
I am going to church.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
A man, my lord?
A theatre poet?
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
You are on my ground.
Serve.
Just serve.
What?
Will you shut up and play.
Victory is the same as defeat. It s giving in to destructive competitive urges.
About what?
I don t have time.
Have you seen him?
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or
Think about it.
Come on, David.
I m only asking you both to think about it.
But don t tell me that you re not tempted by it. Don t tell me that you re not interested. I know you well enough.
He couldn t get his car started.
You call them if you want.
A spade, we need a spade I wish you would concentrate we need a spade if we re going to dig a pit.
Dig the pit, I don t know.
Then what? Who s going to do what?
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
We all are, David, we re all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
I don t hear this.
You re telling me you want out? Already? You re telling me you don t want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can t wait any longer.
I just thought we should discuss it.
But not quite.
Is this necessary?
Can we talk about something?
I want to talk now.
Now.
I don t know.
I don t know.
Security.
There was a break in.
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
You re sure? There s lots more.
What s wrong?
You re not eating.
Not eating like you used to, that s what.
Looking for you? Yes.
Your friends.
It doesn t neccessarily matter. They don t even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
They can know all they like, it won t do them the slightest bit of good
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
So I gathered.
It s all right. I ll forward your mail.
Oh, no, no, no. Don t let it worry you. Not at all. It s probably for the best.
Not at all.
Yeah?
About the mail
Where do you think you ll go?
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
I don t know anything about it.
Cover it?
But there s no
I don t know.
This is just an informal discussion.
What does it look like?
That s because he is. Does that upset you?
Well, then?
Take another look at these two.
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
What?
That s all?
Oh, no problems. Don t worry.
Yes, thanks.
Yes.
Oh, yes, it s great.
Yes.
Well, yes.
Cameron?
Maybe you should go, Alex. You ll meet someone wonderful.
For the flat.
She hated you
More than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
Alex.
It was you, Juliet, it was you
What I am.
Which is a hack.
A miserable, burnt out, empty shell of a Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
Yeah.
You re right.
So I gathered.
David?
His car s still there.
So what s wrong with that?
Alex, how shouldI know? I m just a girl.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
Open it.
Yes.
Yes.
Did what?
What? What s wrong?
I m just looking.
Don t look?
Why not? What s wrong, Juliet? Aren t you curious? Don t you wonder what he died from?
It s not every day I find a story in my own flat.
What?
I thought we all were.
But you re a doctor. You kill people every day.
OK.
Yeah, we don t want another stiff on our hands. Don t fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
Who?
No, I don t.
That s not him.
Who was it?
Are you all right?
No, no, it s different.
It tastes different.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
He can t stay up there.
Yeah, he s got to go to work, hasn t he? You think he ll come down for that?
What are you doing here?
David?
Oh, good.
Forget it.
And the money?
Where he can t get it?
No.
It s the only way.
You re frightened.
I ll wait there.
Everything.
Alex.
The perfect couple, I should say.
Don t worry about it. I d do exactly the same, but I don t think I m his type.
I see.
What?
You were going to say something.
You mean I can have the room?
What about?
Burglary?
Of course.
Did you hear anything before he cries?
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
Well, if you do, you ll let us know?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
Who said there were four?
No, three. Who said there were four?
Yes, absolutely.
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn t?
You re sure of that.
Oh, yes, I m fine, thanks, just fine.
I m sorry.
Two hundred pounds?
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
What?
No.
No one. I promise.
No one.
Oh, don t be so coy, dear. You re going to Rio.
It wasn t like that.
Sorry?
Right here?
Well, it s a wide range of, eh
Exactly what I was
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Eh
I m not sure
Yes, sir.
I m boring?
Oh, I see, I thought you meant
What happened to that guy?
That one, last week.
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
You must be Juliet.
Well, I ve been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I m trying to write a novel.
A priest who dies.
Yeah. Well, maybe I ll change it.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It s about some other guy, some guy who s not a priest, who doesn t die. You see, it s better already.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
No.
Did he sound upset?
I m a doctor.
No. But he needs treatment.
A certain weakness.
You know about it?
And that s not the same thing?
That sounds fine.
What?
Yes, the first one s fine. Heathrow direct.
The first one was fine.
I m sorry, I ve never seen any of them.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day new people, new faces. No?
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I mean, that s what it s like.
Is it real?
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there s Devra, whatta you want?
It s great. You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
I am... except I ve gotta do somebody at their house.
No, it s a very groovy girl.
She s a very groovy girl. That s the problem.
Who?
Maybe... why do you ask?
Why?
I don t know. He s a hairdresser.
Yes, but... I thought...
That you were just indulging me.
What do you expect me to do about it?
What, who? Oh she s very nice, yes I mean normally
That s okay too.
Yes and you don t have to be sarcastic about it, that s a beautiful thing he s doing some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks
What are you talking about?
My keys.
I m not. I mean I ve gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Listen, baby, don t leave, really.
I ll be right back, it s just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
That s very serious. Who s her doctor?
Gee, that s very serious...
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
It turned out to be cancer.
So what are you doing going over there? You re not her doctor.
You re very rude... if you don t come back
I don t want to see you anymore.
I gotta talk to you.
But you don t know what happened.
Calm down, baby.
What?
What?
I don t want to place you in any position
What kind of treatment?
You re looking great, baby.
Whatever you say.
What about?
Why don t you see Lester?
Yes.
The shop. I think you re a good investment, and I don t mind telling him.
I hope she s all right.
I wouldn t say so if I didn t.
And I certainly wouldn t tell Lester.
I mean it or I wouldn t say it.
No, that s okay, I ll do It now.
Well she...
She s a friend of Jill s.
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
Yeah.
Hungry?
No thanks.
I do her hair, yeah.
No thanks.
No thanks.
Yeah.
... yeah.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
Have you ever made it with a girl?
Am I what?
Why?
Don t make conversation with me.
I never get my hair done.
In fact, I don t think I ve ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
You think that s funny, don t you?
You live a phony cheap cop out existence.
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that s funny too?
Then what do you think?
I am not like my mother!
I am not!
Look... Do you wanna fuck me?
Right.
Great.
She is.
Great.
Right.
Right, that s right.
They are?
I guess not...
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
Yeah.
Buffums?
I ve got heads here, Norman.
Oh fuck, Norman!
Somebody s going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary s not here.
Look, Norman, I m not the shampoo girl.
Maybe she ll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don t think she ll mind. Do you?
Jill s really great, isn t she?
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester well, he s very sweet.
He s a very private person, actually.
You going to tell him?
No, thanks.
Probably the bathroom.
I d cut it...
Yeah, I think so...
Great.
Whew.
It s hot in here.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
And what?
Boy, that sauna is really... can t you turn it down or something?
Did Lester know about him?
I just have to do one little thing.
What?
Did I what?
Hey, I don t tell.
Yeah?
You did, I know you did.
Yeah, baby...
I know... you don t know, I know.
What are you talking about?
Oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
This guy with Jill.
What about it?
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I m some cigar butt he s got between his teeth
We can t now.
Jackie, can we
What?
You were great.
No you didn t.
You were great.
Sammy s?
Look, you don t have to entertain me...
We re friends.
Oh I thought you were
Mmmm
Look who s talking.
Yes, you
We are?
Why?
Yes, honey, you ve got to get out of here.
Please, we ll have to talk later
Forget about last night, it s okay, we ll talk when I get back
No
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
It s too late...
Lester s left Felicia. He s taking me to Acapulco on the five o clock flight. He s asked me to marry him.
What s that supposed to mean?
Don t go, Jackie...
Don t leave me...
What for?
No, man.
What?
Wanda...
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she s always asking for you, and she was furious you weren t here.
She s murdered her hair... you do something with her, I m never going to touch her again.
If I have to touch her again, I ll throw up!
Wash her.
Oh yeah.
Otis is dead.
Oh sweetheart...
Please, please forgive me...
Why did you come in today?
How did you get here?
That s too bad.
Hey, baby, what s happening?
I don t have your number, stop by the shop.
What re you talking about?
Where?
Well, it s a big canyon. Honey, I m sorry but I ve gotta get back... just for a minute.
What s gonna happen?
Well, like what?
What?
Who?
George, I don t
Keep moving
Fine. How are you?
What?
How?
Honey, what happened?
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
What about me?
I am?
I am?
Do you really mean that?
Yeah, baby.
We live together now.
Of course I like children.
I m around you and I like you, don t I?
Okay... Night, baby.
What!
Okay, baby. Okay...
Hey, baby, what s happening?
Could I talk to you for a second?
I said I wasn t sure if I could go.
Egypt!
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
Okay.
Yeah, baby.
Baby, I m in the middle of work.
About what?
Going where?
Honey, have they offered you the job?
Your advice!
I want your feelings about it.
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don t, I ve got to know.
When I get off work.
I ll call you.
I ll call you.
Neither do I, baby.
Nothing, I ll call you, okay?
Where s your car?
Who?
Look at the way I live.
What do you mean, what is it? It s some political bullshit.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I d never clean it up.
Ha, ha.
Go ahead.
What? I ll see you later...
I don t want to fight either. Look... uh I love you.
I didn t want him meeting me here.
What is.
Yes.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
Where did this come from?
Baby, don t do this. I do love you.
How many?
I just want to know, that s all.
I don t want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
It ll help me if you ll tell me.
No, it ll help me, really
... honest. At least you re honest with me.
That s all you ve got to say?
Tell me something did you talk about me?
Did you?
Yeah, I know. Did you?
Did you?
Did you?
What did you say?
What did you say?
What did you say?
A wash and set.
No?
But Mr. Norman said
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that s all.
Well, yeah.
Thank you.
In a way. But...
Thank you.
They re not?
You re right.
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
Oh yeah?
What about, tonight?
It s nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
... this doing hair it s...
Oh, hey...
I don t know what to...
Yeah?
Isn t that bad for it?
Layered?
Yeah. How long have you been here?
Well... who are those guys?
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Well, what?
Now wait a minute...
But...
Hey, have em put me away, or whatever you re gonna do, okay?... I m too tired to lie, I m too tired to tell the truth... I m too tired for anything.
What can I say!
I m not anti Establishment.
Then don t... just have em beat me up or whatever you re gonna do.
What, do you think I planned it?
Didn t they tell you?
We re always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don t like it... that s just how it is... look, it s got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia s got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she s getting older... her daughter hates her, what s she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
No thanks.
I know.
Who?
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
Oh yeah...
I don t either, Lester, I swear to you I don t.
What about her?
Lester, it just happened.
No
Yes I do.
What?
A soap?
And?
What was it, somebody s daughter?
That s very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
You do?
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss this is Jackie.
Is that right?
George is going to open a shop.
I am?
Who do you think I was talking to?
Steve?
Then you were talking to him.
So I can t talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I m going to tell him I m screwing Lester Karpf!
What s that?
Just a second, I ve gotta clean this mess up or the dogs ll have it all over the house.
Aren t you going to have one?
Why not?
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I ve told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Jesus, she s my best friend.
I don t know. Why don t you ask him?
Jackie, what re you doing?
Oh yeah?
I ll call you.
See you later.
Who is that?
Oh, honey, don t be totally naive.
So what s your point?
I know, I m sorry.
George is great but I know what you mean.
Don t be silly.
No. No really.
Nothing.
Well, it s George.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
But you have problems?
I guess it s all got to do with this shop.
Well, you know what I mean.
I m exaggerating.
Jackie
Well... it s not so much the number of times he does it, it s... he does it for a long time.
Well yes you know that about George.
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half sometimes forty five minutes that s quite a while, isn t It?
Honey?
When you say forty five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
I guess I just blocked it out, that s all.
Well, there was this one time
I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
Well it was very hot so I d left the door open and the water was running so I didn t hear him come down the stairs...
Didn t you have any panties on?
What did you do?
No, it sounds very sexy did you just stay by the sink all that time?
That s right.
Are you kidding? His hair s probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you ve reduced me to eating weeds.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Is he an enemy?
Sort of a boyfriend?
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
Never mind.
No.
Getting your hair done... Would you like to go to a party?
Well... sure...
I don t think so.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
Those Arabs won t be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
We can t really leave that poor man here alone.
His car. They have it blocked.
Oh no, honey, I ll do that...
Jill.
Gee... that s wonderful, Jill.
No... how long did you say?
No, it s not that...
No.
No.
Please don t misunderstand... I d really like to go.
Have they sat down?
Where to, Les?
Yes?
You mean they ate each other up?
Yes, Dad.
I am, Dad. Dad?
Then why don t you go to sleep?
Dad?
I guess so.
What?
No, Dad.
Yes, Dad.
I m not supposed to.
Tony.
Tony s the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
What about Room 237?
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, there s hardly anybody to play with around here.
Okay, Mom.
All right.
Okay... oh!
Yeah.
Yes?
Not right now, Daddy s asleep.
Come on, Doc. He only went to bed a few hours ago. Can t you wait till later?
Danny... what s the matter, hon?
Danny, come here!
No.
Talking to Tony.
If you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Why not?
Where does he go?
Do I have to?
Only about three months. Eh we re from Vermont. My husband was teaching school there.
Did Tony s first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Well how can I repay you?
Well I m going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Advocaat is it?
Yes, sir.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren t you once the caretaker here?
And, er... where are they now?
He is, Mr. Torrance.
A nigger.
Your son has a very great talent. I don t think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
There s nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
Hallo. My name s Dick Halloran. I m the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Thank you very much. I ll do that.
Sure.
I m a Wendy.
God. This is the kitchen, huh?
I wouldn t know what to do with it if I did.
Doc. You called Danny Doc twice just now.
Yeah. We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons. But how did you know that?
Good.
Pleased to meet you.
What line of work are you in now?
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
Your credit s fine, Mr. Torrance.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
It s good to be back, Lloyd.
Hi, hon. How s it going?
What time is it?
I guess we ve been staying up too late.
I love it. I really do. I ve never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Okay. I understand. I ll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you ll let me read something then.
Yes.
Yes.
It s okay. It s okay, now. Really.
Yes, I did.
Yes.
Jack...
I can t really remember.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Why?
Wendy!
I m not going to hurt you.
Stop swinging the bat.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Wendy give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
Stop swinging the bat.
Go away.
Go away.
Wendy...
Yes?
Oh, no problem at all. I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn t mind. Thanks.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that? It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Well...
That s very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
Not for me.
They ll love it.
I m intrigued.
Shut in together over long periods of time.
Put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
No, my son s discovered the games room.
Royalty?
Hi.
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
Fine.
Eight thirty.
I don t accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don t accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Blue. This blue.
Sure, Uncle Al.
Come on, Jane it was Brady s idea. I couldn t stop him.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Where s Mom?
Don t tell me what I have to do and what I don t, booger brains.
All except my legs... I don t think I can walk.
What s that?
For getting a divorce?
What kind of noises?
Rats...
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Yeah.
No.
Uncle Al, what if it s not a guy?
It s just an outward symbol of everything that s inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
I ll give you the telephone numbers of my ex wives, dear boy they ll be interested to hear that.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane s walking around like she s King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
What?
Do I need one?
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
I don t get you.
Sure.
Yeah, I know. It s great!
Yeah... sure.
A tracer. You ll like it.
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That s a fancy way of saying eyewash. He s got a corneal inflammation.
What the hell does that matter?
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
I don t know. But I know you didn t see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that s all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what s been happening in this town.
You want to know what I think?
I didn t shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was
I told you!
There! You see!
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don t think that was a dream, do you?
You re not going to let it go, are you?
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
But Uncle Al! You said
If you keep doing that, you re going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama tell her I ll see her Thursday.
Yeah. Sister Mary Pat was discussing it. You know she thinks it s a sin.
What about crack? You a user?
What you say?
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
You know what we re saying!
Yes, Mary?
Were you tempted?
SING!
SING!
' Cause we love it so damn much. And cause we gotta come here. Probation.
And you listen to that?
Hey, I know, it s hard. But do what I do.
Hey, Sisters. Are you going in there?
You ain t got nothin I ain t seen.
Mary Robert, don t panic. Remember what we talked about? Experience?
What?
What did who say?
Vince...
You said that? And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her? Did he say we d be happy?
You want me to go against a priest? Get excommunicated? You think I m nuts?
We can still see each other. Just like always. It s a different kind of sin. Smaller.
Yes?
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
And to say you re sorry. About this afternoon. And the things you said. Forgotten. Completely. Do you understand? Forgotten.
Good evening, Vincent.
Yes, Betty?
Oh huh.
What is it, Betty?
Oh my!
Yes, Betty?
D00 LANG, DOO LANG, D00 LANG.
At least he s not a cop. At least he can afford a decent gift.
Yeah, like what? Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out? Lottery tickets? A travel iron?
' Cause you re always out, arresting people. Making trouble. I don t know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing! I couldn t hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
Information, baby. I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
You couldn t believe it? Vince the Prince?
He didn t do you a favor.
You d lose. You d die. All over the sidewalk. And into the street.
Okay no limo.
What re you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
It s a convent. All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
But Vince has contacts all over the place! This is San Francisco! They ll be looking for me!
I can t stay here! I ll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
Not again. You can t keep calling. Somebody s going to catch on to where you are.
Calm down. Look, I didn t want to tell you this, but we ve had some problems with our protection program lately.
Keeping our witnesses alive. We hide them, but there s a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
You blew it big time. She doesn t want you back.
She s counting on it. She s concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
What if I was Vince? You d be dead right now. What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
You re supposed to be hiding out!
Listen to yourself. This isn t a career opportunity.
Jesus, look at you You re glowing.
Yeah. You look... great. I mean it..
Me too.
No. Most of the time I m thinking about you. And now... you ve really changed.
Just remember you re a target. Don t you think Vince has a T. V.?
How?
What?
I think they d understand.
You don t get it! It s a big thing for them, it s like... Caesar s Palace. Prime time. They re singing for the Cardinals. It s like... " Star Search. " If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They ve worked really hard, they deserve this.
I don t know. There s only one way to be absolutely sure.
Vince is getting desperate. Where is she, Eddie? Where d you stash her?
You won t even tell us?
Who are you guys?
We didn t tell you what?
It s a bluff, Vince.
Not... totally.
It didn t work, Vince.
Neither did you!
It s that call you were expecting, Vince.
Many have.
Must have been the Redman. A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
How did you hear this?
You are the blacksmith. Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
I hit him square.
More than enough, actually. I beg you, no more, please.
Is that all you say? Look at her.
And now Jonathan Masbath.
My talisman. It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face. But, I cannot run. If I run in fear, it is worthless.
No, you listen! You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men s beds?
Feel free to form your own opinion. Though it appears you already have.
Excuse me... I should apologize. I, um... I... have no great love of...
Small talk.
Perhaps it is because your suitor s hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
The massive fellow... Brom. For someone you call " friend, " he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
Are you so superstitious?
There is no such thing as magic.
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
I have had them since childhood. I cannot remember what from.
You made this, and the drawings?
If you want. But...
I insist that you have it.
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
They have done nothing of the sort.
No stone may be left unturned. It may appear harsh...
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword. I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing. The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
There was no blind stabbing. This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
It was not butchery.
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
To avenge his father, and the others.
No, actually, you were not. Every word you spoke had truth in it.
What?
No, but... why do you ask that?
She died. Her lungs were diseased... two years ago. What is this about?
If you want me to go, I will. Do you want me to leave?
Katrina. Why do you follow?
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
The skull is gone.
It was you there?
And, what did he say?
What did he say, Katrina?
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms. They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
What would you have me believe?
The name Van Tassel is blackened. You share that name.
I... I can t do this.
You are from the Hollow?
The Horseman. Yes.
Wait up, I ll leave with you and lock up.
I can t remember.
Yeah, that s a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I ve heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
I ve tinkered around on em a little bit.
I like them french fried potaters.
You got any money?
Well, I m gonna pay you today for this comin week, so you ll have some walkin around money. When you get off this evenin you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin to keep you busy at night.
That boy wants me to.
I fixed it. Hit s a workin pretty good.
Good to see you, Bill. How s everybody doin?
No, don t guess I do. Scooter, good to meet you. This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I ll understand if you get nervous about it. I m not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
He s a regular whiz at it. That s all he did when he was a kid.
He won t have anything to do with him. Now you say it s all right for him to stay out here in the back?
Well, I ve got a roomful of work for him to do. Can t get Scooter to do any of it.
How are you, Bill?
Just thought I d check on Karl and see if everything s working out.
Is him stayin here workin out?
Can I see him?
I was kindly wantin somethin or nother d eat.
You have any biscuits for sale?
What you got that s good to eat?
What do you like to eat here?
French fried potaters.
How much you want fer em? I ll get some of them I reckon.
What you got in there, warshing?
Ain t you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
I ll help you tote em if I don t give out first.
They was a boy. We made friends.
It s too big.
Yeah She was a big un. You ain t drunk drivin are you Doyle?
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You ll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
You know better than that. We re on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
I ain t sayin it s right. I m just tellin the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
You sure are hung up on people bein sweet. Speakin of which, where s your girlfriend? I thought he was comin by here for something.
Ain t that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin around with that fag?
Boy, ain t you somethin else. Talkin back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
What?
Please Doyle, don t.
Please don t. Not tonight. I m not up for it. They always stay till mornin. I m just give out, Doyle.
No Doyle. Vaughan don t want to come to a party with you.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I ll say who stays and goes. You ve got a house, why don t you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin me, I ll kill you dead as a doornail.
Don t tell me what to do.
Don t tell me what to do.
Don t tell me what to do.
It went real good.
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
He s real honest. He wouldn t steal nothin.
No sir.
I hate you!
I know Albert. We re friends.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Oh, yeah, I m thrilled.
It s not your house, Doyle, it s Linda s.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
Different ones. The Bible s one of em.
A good deal of it, I reckon. Can t understand all of it.
Childers.
How does a feller go about gettin ahold of the police?
What numbers do you punch?
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They re pretty good ones.
Why? Hi, Karl.
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can t go there now. I ll see you later.
Childers.
Different ones. One s the Bible. One of ems a book on Christmas. One of ems how to be a carpenter.
Ain t got nowhere to set em down.
I did live there in the state hospital.
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn t right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin me in jail.
Yeah.
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
I reckon I feel all right.
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
Yeah it is. Your name s Frank.
You told me to come by.
I ain t no good at it. I just come by.
I don t want to worry your mama with company.
I was kindly needin to do some tradin. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
Naw. Didn t have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
My mother s dead. My daddy s s posed to be around still. He don t want to have nothin to do with me though.
He never did want to. I figure he ain t changed his mind much.
You don t need to know all of that. You re just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you re still a boy. They ll be plenty of time for the other.
How come her to keep bein girlfriends and all with him if he s mean to her?
Yeah, I remember you a tellin me that.
Why did he do that, reckon.
Yeah, I did.
Two people.
I thought they was.
I growed up and got taught it ain t right to kill nobody.
You ort not to talk that way. You re just a boy.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain t no count. He s mean to you and your mama. Yore mama and that feller that s carryin me to get somethin d eat s gonna be back here directly.
I reckon if you want me to. I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
Yeah.
That gal that made employee of the month give em to me for awalkin with her.
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
That s than un on Christmas I was tellin you about.
All right then.
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
All right then.
Yeah, I recollect it.
If you want me to.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don t. I ll get em for ye.
They ort to. You re a good boy.
Naw.
That s real good. You ort not to if ye ain t married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don t seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though. You don t touch yourself, do you?
Pull on your works. Your privates.
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
He ain t no count.
I don t reckon I know.
Naw.
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn t get old enough to play with.
Yeah.
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin another n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn t care too much for me so I reckon they didn t need somethin else to worry em with.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see cause they was a noise and somethin movin in it. Hit was bloody like around that towel. Hit was a little ol bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
Yes sir. Right then it was.
A little ol boy.
I didn t feel right about doin that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
I heared it cryin a little through that box.
I wadn t but six or eight. I reckon I didn t know what to do. I didn t know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn t want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
Hits been hard thinkin about it. They ain t a day goes by I don t think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin I could of did, too. Shouldn t no bad things happen to childern. All the ol bad things ort to be saved up for folks that s growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn t of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
I ve studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
Readin on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I ve always been partial to wood buildin s and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin s they got here don t make no sense to me so far. You seem like yore tails a draggin a might. You got somethin wrong with ye?
I don t reckon I know. I ain t found no way yet and I m three or four times as old as you. Might be that s just the way folks is.
Is that right?
You will? For sure?
We ll be on teams, me and you?
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin me.
Them boys was tryin to pull me down pretty hard.
No sir.
I wadn t thinkin about nothin else just like you told me I d do.
I knowed you d be here. What are you a doin digging with that stob?
I m glad of it you was borned. I reckon I ain t gonna be there in the garage no more.
You re just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
That feller s a whole sight meaner than me. He d just whup the tar out of me.
I m tired, too, Frank. If I ain t around no more, it don t mean I don t care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
You don t want to give away all your books.
Man. Thanks. You know when you get a feelin and you don t know why?
I ve got a feelin today.
Like something different. I don t know. You re leavin ain t you, Karl?
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
They ain t even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he s an Indian. His real name s Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
I m fine, honey. Let s just try and forget about tonight.
Did Vaughan go home?
Did Karl go to bed?
I bet he don t. Karl likes me.
Mama?
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
Doyle wouldn t really kill you, would he?
He s lyin Mama. He ain t gonna do better.
Yeah.
I ain t got no boy.
I ain t got no boy.
Yes, I guess you are.
You better go get your things.
You better go get em.
I want to come back and stay here.
I reckon I don t care nothin about bein a free man. I don t know how to go about it.
Naw.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he p me out anyway.
I m pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I reckon.
I never was no good with history.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
My history.
I told em about it. They know I m well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
That boy, he s my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
Tolerable, I reckon.
I didn t aim to.
Right now?
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can t go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn t slept at all?
Well, set down and I ll make some biscuits and gravy.
It s all right. You know I was thinkin there s this girl that works with me. She s real heavy, but she s cute in the face. Well, you know, she s slow. She s a little bit, I think. She s not retarded, just it don t matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
Vaughan s " friend " will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
That s okay. It s not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
Yes ma am. I like your garage. I wouldn t never hurt you or your boy. I d lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
No ma am. I m a goin off sommers.
Frank, he went off, too. He ain t gonna be in there when you get indoors.
He wanted to go off and play, I reckon. You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don t have to worry yourself none.
Ma am?
You re a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I ve seen it. He wouldn t know what to do without ye.
You ve been real good to me, too. It ain t ever body that d make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin.
Naw, I don t believe you have. I don t reckon I never been in here. This store didn t used to be here.
I s horned and raised here up till I s twelve year old.
What s that you say?
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox s outfit.
So, you re really going to stay here?
Did you knock on the door yet?
How long have you been standing here?
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
I reckon not.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
I ve heard it said that way.
I wouldn t never hurt them.
Oh. How about before that?
I ain t a stayin. I need to ast you fer a favor.
This evenin I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin and bein mean to folks. Will you give me your word you ll do it?
Frank s just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
He s retarded s all. You know he s always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain t a good one with his mean ass.
I don t think he sees you as a guy guy.
Vaughan, don t get pushy.
In a few minutes we re gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn t bother you?
Do you smell shit?
No, we have to get this story.
Nice to meet you. I m Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She s here to take the pictures.
Yes sir.
Well, yeah, it s for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it s a regular paper, you know.
No thank you.
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
Before they were married?
That s really strange. What does it mean?
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can t ask him any questions?
Can I ask you a question? If he s so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
Signs?
We ve got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don t worry, you won t run into him in the parking lot.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
Wherever he wants to. I think he s going back to Millsburg where he s from. It s just about twenty miles from here.
Why?
You mean about y all bein together in " that " way?
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
It s my birthday.
I wouldn t actually call it a party. It s more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday. The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there s Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
Three s a crowd. Yes, I m aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn t get himself into trouble.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
Better make it charge.
I confess.
Until she was twelve. She moved here in forty nine.
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I m from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
It s just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
American literature. What else?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth Century American Fiction.
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it s true. Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
That s the subject of my last chapter.
It looks worse than it is. I m okay.
I ll tell you all about it...... but not here.
Yeah, well, I ve sort of been out of commission. How s Melville?
I d love to.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Okay. I ll read it tonight and call you tomorrow. It doesn t seem to be too long.
Huh?
For me? I ll have the same thing.
What s that, Sol?
What s the difference?
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, " One corned beef sandwich, " and then, " Another corned beef sandwich, " I ll say, " Two corned beef sandwiches. "
Hey, man. Good to see you. What ll it be today?
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don t you think?
The Queen of England?
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
Yeah, I did.
It s mine all right. I ve owned that little sucker for a long time.
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn t take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman. Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
That s what people see, but that ain t necessarily what I am.
Taking pictures? It s a long story. I d need two or three drinks to get through that one.
Well, let s not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
That s right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather. That s why I can never take a vacation. I ve got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
It s my project. What you d call my life s work.
I don t know, it just came to me. It s my corner, after all. It s just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It s a record of my little spot.
You ll never get it if you don t slow down, my friend.
I mean, you re going too fast. You re hardly even looking at the pictures.
They re all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You ve got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You ve got your summer light and your autumn light. You ve got your weekdays and your weekends. You ve got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you ve got your people in shorts and T shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
It s his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
Help? Hmm. It s possible. What did you have in mind?
Yeah, well, I m sorry too. It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I m broke. I can t hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I m saying? My credibility. So yeah, I m sorry, too. About as sorry as I ve ever been in my whole fucking life.
He s crazy.
You re right. I just wasn t sure you knew.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
Not a peep.
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
Uh, better make it one.
Yeah, I know, but I m trying to cut down. Somebody s worried about my health.
That s a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of em.
Good? Of course. Are you kidding? I ll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I ll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How s that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
Ready. Any time you are.
Okay. You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it s the only camera I ve ever had. Are you following me so far?
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn t even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn t there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn t tell me where she was.
Yeah, probably.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don t see how you can call that a good deed.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
And now you ve got your Christmas story, don t you?
I mean, it s a good story.
Eighteen and a half years.
You re looking good, Auggie.
I don t want to talk about it. If you really want to know. I lost it. And I m not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
You always were a son of a bitch, weren t you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
I ve got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I m not going until you ve heard me out.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
Don t look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
Like what you re doing. I m not going to eat you up. I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Don t rush me, okay? You re jumping to conclusions before I ve even said anything. And besides, it s not for me. It s for our daughter.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen. She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she s living in some shit hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant. I can t bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
It means " happiness. "
I don t know who else to turn to, Auggie.
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn t have to?
You didn t write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don t remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
It fizzled, baby. That s the way it goes. But we had our times, didn t we? It wasn t all bad.
And that s how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn t have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Who the hell knows? He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
I thought I could handle it. I didn t want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn t. She s in real bad, Auggie.
You re a cold hearted bastard, aren t you? How d you ever get so mean, Auggie?
You don t give up, do you?
Where to?
You what?
I think you d better stop the car and let me out.
Yeah, like what?
Look, I m not saying you don t have a daughter. It s just that she s not my daughter.
And what s that supposed to mean?
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It s starting to get on my nerves.
I don t have much choice, do I? It s pretty clear she doesn t want me around.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There s no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that s her business.
Dream on, Auggie. She ll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
I d never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that s just what I don t have. I m flat out dead broke.
Are you calling me a liar? I m telling you I m broke. I don t even have insurance on my goddamned car.
Bully for you.
Why don t you open it and find out?
Five thousand bucks.
It s all yours, baby.
For keeps.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything s under control. I could run this store in my sleep.
I don t know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
I don t know. Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
I almost got married once.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I d start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn t see, an eye that couldn t shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can t see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn t going to be in tiptop shape.
I try not to, anyway. It s better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You re the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You re the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you ve had two heart attacks, and I m still waiting for my first.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they re going to legislate us out of business anyway.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it ll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
It s all set. My guy in Miami said he d have them within the next few weeks. Are you sure you don t want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten thousand dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They re just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
It s the law that s buying. That s what s so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
They come in, they go out. I ve got it planned to the last detail.
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked out son of a bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked out crazy fella?
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o clock and we ll talk about it, okay? We ll see what we can work out.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
What is this, some kind of joke?
Shit. I don t want your money, you little twerp. It s probably stolen anyway.
And why the hell would you give me money?
Your job? You ve got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece of shit job like that for?
Good, Auggie. Real good. All finished.
Huh?
When I tell you it s open. It s open when I tell you it s open!
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don t know nothing, it s like paradise. I know what that is. It s after you re dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
And how much are these?
And these?
And these?
I think I ll take them.
The refrigerator?
Thanks for the tip.
What does that mean?
What can I do for you?
How the hell did you get into the building?
The damn lock s broken again. And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Thomas? Who s Thomas?
I m telling you. I don t know anyone named Thomas.
You mean Rashid?
Well, whatever his name is, he s not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven t heard from him since.
Look, lady, that s enough. If you don t calm down. I m going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
That s what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy fourth Street.
He doesn t go to the Trinity School?
And his parents?
I shouldn t have let him go.
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life. I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don t know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
And you told your nephew about it?
And?
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
Jesus.
It can t have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
And he s never tried to get in touch with his son?
I don t know. I haven t decided yet.
It s a free country, isn t it? As long as I m not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
I m not going to rob you, mister. Do I look like a thief?
Just passing through.
I m working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it s kind of interesting.
It ll cost you five bucks.
Once you look at it, you re going to want to buy it from me. That s guaranteed. And that s the price: five bucks. So if you re not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It ll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
I just tell it like it is, mister. If I m getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
Not a one.
It was just a thought.
What s your offer?
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It s not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
Five dollars an hour? I ll take it.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn t it? I ll tell you what happened to my arm. I ll tell you what happened. Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, " Cyrus, you re a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I m going to fill your body with spirits, and then I m going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I m going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I m going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don t forget what you did to that poor girl, I m going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I m going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways. "
I don t know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it s no easy task for a man to change his nature. I m off the booze, though. Haven t had a drop in six years. And now I ve got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I ve ever known. And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior. So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I ll be in pretty good shape.
And this one, in case you haven t guessed, is Junior.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don t you?
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
Well what?
What do you want me to say?
Baby? And what baby is that?
Yeah, well, there ain t no baby in there now. You dig? There s nothing in there now.
Yeah? And why is that?
Jesus, Tommy, it ain t science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That s how it works.
Huh?
Tick tock, tick tock.
I can t believe I did that... Christ. I m walking around in a fog...
No, wait. You can t just walk off. You saved my life.
I owe you something.
Yes it is. It s a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
Good. Lemonade it is. I m Paul.
That s okay. I ve already had lunch.
I mean breakfast.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
You don t have to tell me if you don t want to, but I might be able to help.
That s true. But I also owe you something, and I m not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job. What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
In Manhattan?
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It s a little far from home, isn t it?
The what?
Uh huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Except that there s no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
But your body is in the world, isn t it? If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn t necessarily refuse, would you?
I m not " people. " I m just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
In case you re wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I m not offering you a long term lease just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
This is the first house I ve been in without a TV.
But then you don t get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
Yeah, I can believe it.
Is your father an artist?
He s dead?
Drawing s a good thing.
What time is it?
Eight thirty?
I m sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
I m a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It s because we re still growing. We don t know where our bodies end and the world begins.
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren t you afraid I might steal it?
It just won t do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won t do, will it?
How long have you been here?
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
It sounds like our time is up, doesn t it?
No hard feelings, okay? It s a small place, and I can t get my work done with you around.
Are you going to be all right?
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Take good care of yourself, okay?
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
I don t know. For helping me out.
I bought it. Twenty nine ninety five on sale at Goldbaum s TV and Radio. Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You ll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work.
Business appointment. I m seeing my broker at three o clock.
I don t have much time.
You don t really want to know.
Okay, okay. It s all so stupid. There s this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that s what people call him. The kind of guy you don t want to cross paths with.
I crossed paths with him. That s why I m trying to stay clear of my neighborhood. To make sure I don t run into him again.
Why don t you go to the police?
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you d be safe.
What makes you think you ll be any safer around here? It s only about a mile away from where you live.
It looks like they ve met in this apartment.
Maybe. Or maybe it s the other people who don t belong.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
What time did you get to bed last night?
You work too hard, you know that?
Just so you don t overdo it. You don t want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
That s logical. And if you don t sleep, you don t need a bed. Saves you money, too. So what s this story you re working on, anyway?
Come on, just a little hint.
The inspiration.
No way.
The end.
It s my birthday. I m seventeen years old as of forty seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
I just did.
His only copy?
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no... no writer would ever do a thing like that. Would he?
Is it yours?
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
Yeah, I picked it up.
And started to run.
That s just it. I didn t think. I just did it.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
That s it. In a nutshell.
No way. There s no way I m giving that money back. It s my money now.
That money is my whole future.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
It wasn t my fault.
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
What are you talking about? You can t be serious.
I m not going to do it.
I pay Auggie, and I ve got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
If you re lucky. Then again, it depends on what you call living.
Medium rare, please.
Yes, please.
Yes, please.
Oh, yeh?
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
Carl held it for em. Called it a lease. They make payments every June and December...
Well. Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he s starin at me with these narrow eyes. Givin me his mean face.
That he d keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
Tried to. Defaulted on their payments.
A thousand.
Is that your third question?
You were... overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
Your husband returned at, what, seven o clock?
Of course not. We re just not quick to run and boast. In case something went wrong.
So you hid the truth. Deliberately.
You re implying th...
Your friends would. Your dad would kill me with a machete.
I m sorry about your arm. Kabuo and I. Are very sor...
I did. But the jury won t s...
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand to hand combat.
So. Wide cross section of men to evaluate. And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration. Did you find him eager?
And the next one...?
And the last...?
You bet. And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl s boat.
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes... I d maybe look for a... Japanese person. With a bloody gun butt. A right handed fella, to be precise.
Could you tell me what kendo is?
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
But isn t the truth that there are several other ways to explain each of these twelve pieces.
That s curious. I was appealing to their intelligence.
Oh, yeh. But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn t wantin to sell.
I have told the truth.
I slept til one thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news. We talked for a few hours. I left at six and went straight to my boat.
You re wondering why I held it.
That s what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he d have no reason to lie. He couldn t know that it would help his case.
Still lashed to the mast.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn t that quite a coincidence?
Maybe...?
But you could be wrong. He could have climbed up earlier.
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely. We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel. Just below the mast.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Naw, I had that around for a while.
I told your wife. Trials aren t always so much about actual truth. As about what folks believe is true. That s sad. And it s real.
Right. In the middle. Of the floor.
Yessir, there d been real heavy fog.
Didn t think about it at the time. So no, it didn t strike me odd.
A little. Yes. You have to wonder.
It is.
He s done some on the spot refit ting. You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D 6.
Two D 6 s. That s the kind his well was fitted for.
No.
Apparently.
I don t think so.
He was heavy, but we were real careful. But I don t remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
She s alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D 6, which must have been a spare.
Even though a D 6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in. Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
Meaning that he wasn t murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Obviously.
The same.
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don t see how it could be.
Sure, anything s poss...
I already said that, b...
But you are certain that he died by drowning.
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased s right hand. The report says recent origin. How recent? As much as 24 hours before death?
As I said, in every way. Physically and psychologically. More endurance, quicker responses, better hand eye, improved technical training. Where the First Psychology gave you ninety eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99. 4.
I... see. I m not sure I quite get your... point...
That s up to you field guys. H. Q. wants you to break em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
Such as?
Spirit? Oh! You mean " AQ "... " aggressive qualities "?
Yes. And that one, too.
I suppose you want a tip?
Bye.
Why?
Aren t you a little too young for that, sonny?
Get lost, will you?
Beat it, Buster.
I thought I made it clear I don t want any drinking in this outfit.
Funny? In what way?
Thank you ever so.
A what?
What did he say?
I ll say.
Dentist? We been out of work for four months and you want to blow your first week s pay on your teeth?
How can you be so selfish? We owe back rent we re in four eighty nine bucks to Moe s Delicatessen we re being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry we ve borrowed money from every girl in the line
Of course I am.
No we re not.
First thing tomorrow we re going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
He s a shoo in. I got the word from Max the waiter his brother in law is the electrician who wires the rabbit
Look at those odds ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
What are you worried about? This job is going to last a long time.
Hey, Joe!
Quiet I m thinking.
Shut up, will you? I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
I told you it s a sure thing.
I thought you weren t talking to me.
With you.
Don t you remember? He has this bad tooth it got impacted the whole jaw swole up
So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion... Right?
But, Joe three weeks in Florida! We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus
Now you re talking! We pick up a couple of second hand wigs a little padding here and there call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine
They got the bull fiddle.
As far away as possible.
The police? We d never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo. Wabash 1098.
We are going out of town. But we re going to shave.
Quit stalling. We ll miss the train.
What are you afraid of? Nobody s asking you to have a baby. This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we ll blow this set up.
Watch it, Daphne!
Now you ve done it!
Tore off one of my chests.
Down, Daphne!
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Oh, you don t have to worry about that.
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive. There ll be no buzzing around tonight.
Fight it.
It s not my fault. I didn t invite them.
I got pinched in the elevator.
And I m not even pretty.
I m tired of being a flag. I want to be a bull again. Lets get out of here, Joe. Let s blow.
You promised the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
But this is so humiliating.
All right, all right! But how long can we keep this up?
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around you re after Sugar.
I watched you two on the bus lovey dovey whispering and giggling and borrowing each other s lipstick
You you
Yes, Mr. Fielding you ll pick her up after the show in your motorboat goodbye what s that you said? Oh zowie! I ll give her the message.
You got it made, kid. Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht
Just the three of you on that great big boat you and him and Rudy Vallee.
Of course, you re not. I m going.
No. I m going to be on that boat with Sugar.
He s going to be ashore with you.
That s right.
You can both go take a flying jump.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Don t give me the musketeers! How m I going to keep the guy ashore?
Have I got things to tell you!
I m engaged.
I am.
Osgood proposed to me. We re planning a June wedding.
You think he s too old for me?
Why not? He keeps marrying girls all the time!
Security.
Look, stop treating me like a child. I m not stupid. I know there s a problem.
His mother we need her approval. But I m not worried because I don t smoke.
Like what?
We ve been discussing that. He wants to go to the Riviera but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
Oh, I don t expect it to last. I ll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Like right after the ceremony.
Then we ll get a quick annulment he ll make a nice settlement on me I ll have those alimony checks coming in every month
But Joe this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
I m a boy I m a boy I wish I were dead I m a boy I m a boy What am I going to do about my engagement present?
Naturally. You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I ll have to give it back.
So? It s going to break Sugar s heart when she finds out I m not a millionaire. That s life. You can t make an omelette without breaking an egg.
Nag, nag, nag. Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I ve got Sugar we re really cooking.
Shut up and keep packing.
There s our shaving stuff and there s Sugar.
Get me Room 414.
We can t just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
That s when I was a saxophone player. Now I m a millionaire.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It s our bracelet.
Don t worry. We did the right thing with it.
We ll walk. And if we have to, we ll starve.
Tell him you re going to elope with him.
Terribly sorry.
I ll say.
Good night, honey.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You re a real pal.
If it hadn t been for you, they would have kicked me off the train. I d be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
If there s anything I can do for you
We won t tell anybody not even Josephine.
Stay as long as you d like.
No. It s nice and cozy.
Interesting.
No, no.
That s ridiculous.
That s ridiculous.
Isn t that ridiculous?
What did you say?
Maybe I d better go before I catch something.
I have a very low resistance.
You got some?
I m fine.
You better put on the lights. I can t see what I m doing.
I may spill something.
What s the surprise?
When?
Here. This ll put hair on your chest.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
That s from carrying around the bull fiddle.
What s that?
Run along, Daphne I ll catch up with you.
It sleeps twelve. This is my friend Daphne. She s a Vassar girl.
Now look, Daphne hands off I saw him first.
If I d been watching my step, I never would have met him. Wait till I tell Josephine.
Will she be surprised. I just can t wait to see her face
I guess she s not in here.
Well, I ll come back later.
Believe it or not Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
I hope so.
Yes. He wants me to have supper with him on his yacht he s going to pick me up at the pier.
Of course not. As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around. You see he needs help.
You like it?
Junior gave it to me. It must have at least thirty stones
He s going to South America to marry some other girl that s what they call high finance.
Yes. For a whole year.
What s the big idea?
You got to be blonde
And you got to be girls.
Wait a minute, Joe. Lets talk this over. Why couldn t we do it? Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings. And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band? Grass skirts!
Help yourself.
Me too. Bye now.
Personally, I m Type O.
You don t say.
You invest in shows?
You re not sure?
I m not surprised.
Sorry. I ll be on the bandstand.
Bull fiddle.
Most of the time I slap it.
Wanna bet?
Why?
Goodbye?
I ll throw up!
Who?
They got a Cuban band that s the berries. Why don t we go there blindfold the orchestra and tango till dawn?
Yes, Osgood?
Pleased to meet you.
Osgood I can t get married in your mother s dress. She and I we not built the same way.
Oh, no you don t! Look, Osgood I m going to level with you. We can t get married at all.
Well, to begin with, I m not a natural blonde.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
And I have a terrible past. For three years now, I ve been living with a saxophone player.
And I can never have children.
But you don t understand! I m a MAN!
Well, it is to me. Will you give her a message? I d like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
Just the two of you? What about the crew?
We re just a couple of musicians we come to pick up a car Nellie Weinmeyer s car there s a dance tonight Come on, Jerry.
To Urbana. It s a hundred miles.
We won t breathe a word.
Oh, it s you! You got a lot of nerve
Nellie baby, I ll make it up to you.
Why?
I m not doing anything. I just thought I d go home and have some cold pizza
Yes, Joe.
You need a bass and a sax, don t you?
It s not the backs that worry me.
We ll take it!
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
No funerals.
Where did he conduct?
Oh.
Sugar, you re going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
I m not very bright, I guess.
No, just dumb. If I had any brains, I wouldn t be on this crummy train with this crummy girls band.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can t afford it any more.
Have you ever been with a male band?
That s what I m running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years. Oh, brother!
I ll say.
I can t trust myself. The moment I d start with a new band bingo!
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
Especially tenor sax. I don t know what it is, but they just curdle me. All they have to do is play eight bars of " Come to Me My Melancholy Baby " and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose pimply all over and I come to them.
Every time!
But you re a girl, thank goodness.
That s why I joined this band. Safety first. Anything to get away from those bums.
You don t know what they re like. You fall for them and you love em you think it s going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin and the next thing you know they re borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that s left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it s the same thing all over again. See what I mean? not very bright.
You are?
About what?
What s in Florida?
Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
You re entitled.
Yeah. With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller
Glasses?
Well, now that you ve mentioned it
I might as well stay in there. I won t be able to sleep anyway.
Bienstock. He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose. Wouldn t you know?
Would you mind terribly?
I ll bet there isn t one of them under seventy five.
Saxophone player?
Forget it, Sugar, will you? Forget about saxophone players. You re going to meet a millionaire a young one.
My fault.
I don t think so.
Why?
Well, don t worry. I won t sue you no matter who you are.
Who are you?
Not very likely.
Not at all.
Possible you saw it in a newspaper or magazine Vanity Fair
Would you mind moving just a little? You re blocking my view.
They run up a red and white flag on the yacht when it s time for cocktails.
Certainly not. with all that unrest in the world, I don t think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
No, my flag steward.
No, my cocktail steward. Look, if you re interested in whether I m married or not
Well, I m not.
Up, up, up.
Could be. Do you play the market?
For your own amusement?
You re society girls?
Syncopators does that mean you play that fast music jazz?
Oh. Well, I guess some like it hot. But personally, I prefer classical music.
Good school! And your family doesn t object to your career?
Inauguration balls
Riding to hounds
You know, it s amazing we never ran into each other before. I m sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
I beg your pardon?
What theory?
Tonight?
I d like to but it may be rather difficult.
I only come ashore twice a day when the tide goes out.
It s on the account of the shells. That s my hobby.
Yes. So did my father and my grandfather we ve all had this passion for shells that s why we named the oil company after it.
It s been delightful meeting you both.
What?
Shell Oil, Junior. He s got millions he s got glasses and he s got a yacht.
Maybe you d better go after him if you don t want to lose him.
I am?
Well, you know how those millionaires are. These came for you.
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
Looks like they re on the wrong track.
Just regulation size. We have three like this.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton and Dad took his to Venezuela the company is laying a new pipe line.
Well, that depends on whether you re coming or going I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern and that s the bridge so you can get from one side of the boat to the other how about a glass of champagne?
It s all right for a bachelor.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
Oh a member of the herring family.
I don t mind if I do.
Trophies. You know skeet shooing, dog breeding, water polo...
I ll say. I had two ponies drowned under me.
Yea, of course. Now where could they have put it? On Thursdays, I m sort of lost around here.
It s the crews night off.
Completely.
Oh, it s perfectly safe. We re well anchored the ship is in shipshape and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
You re flattering me.
Oh, it s not that. It s just that I m harmless.
Well, I don t know how to put it but I have this thing about girls.
They just sort of leave me cold.
It s more like a mental block. When I m with girls, it does nothing to me.
Nothing at all?
That makes me feel just awful.
You mean you can t fall in love?
What happened?
Oh, you couldn t possibly.
Oh, no!
Talk about sad.
You poor, poor boy.
How can you think about food at a time like this?
Is it that hopeless?
Have you ever tried American girls?
I have. Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud flat on my back then there were the Mayo Brothers and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths if I weren t such a coward, I d kill myself.
What is it?
I m afraid not. Terribly sorry.
It s like smoking without inhaling.
Thank you.
Mineral baths now really!
Good morning.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Did you have a nice time?
From a rich millionaire.
Me?
Yes. Now about our date for tonight...
I m afraid not. I can t make it tonight.
Not tomorrow, either. You see, I have to leave something unexpected came up I m sailing right away.
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela and I just got a cable from Dad the board of directors decided on a merger.
Quite a while. As a matter of fact, I m not coming back at all.
It s all rather complicated what we call high finance but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and
According to our tax advisers, she s only so so. But that s the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders all those little people who invest their life savings
But you have. You ve given me all that inside information first thing tomorrow I m going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
What s what? Oh, that. just a little going away present.
Not always. But I want you to know I m very grateful for what you did for me.
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage. And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we ll be through here in a couple of weeks.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life and the only one who ever gave me anything.
I know. Every time!
I come to the old lady s funeral.
That s because I ve been on the wagon.
Where are they holding the wake? I m supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Booze.
Coffee?
Who s going to raid a funeral?
Go where?
I never join nothin.
Big joke. Who s the rap this time?
Me? I m just a customer here.
Mozarella? Never heard of him.
From who? Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
Hello, copper. What brings you down to Florida?
Big joke!
Me? I was at Rigoletto.
That s an opera, you ignoramus.
Clark Street? Never heard of it.
Why?
I cut myself shaving.
I sleep with my spats on.
You and who else?
Why wouldn t I?
Well, we all got to go sometime.
What for?
There  s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Except it  s Scotch.
Oh, shut up and be happy. It  s always this or that. You  re never happy, you frowny faced Grumplestilskin.
Pub Golf?
When I freaked out at the pub? That was nothing, just nerves. Don  t worry about it.
Are you sure you  re okay?
So Tony Pee Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
What for?
Still
Or Kat....
Whatever you do, don  t mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies. Or Edith Piaf.
Jeffrey told her last night.
Why, with you.
I  m sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces. Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher Wootens.
Oh, no. She tells this story at every major holiday.
I was pretty hard on her last night. And now she  s getting married.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee Pants.
Mom, please.
She did?
Um, just about everyone.
I had to say something to get you here.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
What?
Other than, he  s shagging your exgirlfriend?
No.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
But, somehow, it was Kat  s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Oh, shut up. You  re an optician.
Shrink, actually.
What?
No, tell me.
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
Let me guess. Amy presumed I  d forget the rings. I think I  m her least favorite person. You know, I am sorry.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there  s something not quite right.
Um, news flash: I don  t give a shit.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
Seven if you count the on and off years. Which I do.
Not for a dog.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It  s no big deal. I promise.
You  re funny.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
He was pretty drunk, but I think he  s still crazy about you.
I don  t know.
Why?
On the nose. I tell you what, because you  re so cute, I  ll take care of our incidentals.
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
It  s cute.
You stand on your tiptoes.
A weekend?
This happened to you?
I have a friend at the magazine.
Oh, no.
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
What?!
I guess so.
Of course not. How... how could it be? Nothing happened.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
Oh, cut the crap!
He was about to un stick me! I paid you to help me get closure.
So, why  d you say yes to me?
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
You  ve always got that to hide behind, don  t you? It  s just business!
What?! No, no. You can  t
You have more than one gynecologist?
You knew?
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. You  re here for the highland flings, I bet.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Yes? No. What? Save the patter for the tourists.
Hi, kiddo.
It  s complicated, Dad.
You don t live around here, do you?
Is he here in Borderdale?
David Lee Morgan. My dog s name is Sounder. That feels better.
Sometime, but not like this.
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
Uh huh...
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
That s where we come from first?
Colored.
What s his name?
What he talk bout?
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn t...
You could? How?
Yes mam...
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn t find him and that s what I wanted to do.
But where is my daddy!?
Nothin...
Yes, mam...
What do that mean?
Yes, Miss Johnson...
No, Miss Johnson...
Gotta wait til visitin days.
Sunday...
Then why don t he holler like he usta?
I don t look like no possum!
That s right!
Yes mam...
No, son. We havta wait til the holiday comes anyway, they won t let womenfolk see their men no time.
No mam I looked all over.
No, ma am... Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
I can do it, Mama you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody s always goin on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don t even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
Mama, don t I always do what you say every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright s and the woods you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don t worry.
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Yes, mam...
Did you find your father?
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
How can you do that? You don t live anywhere near that school.
It s the heat.
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
I wanta get some things.
I didn t say nothin ' bout credit, Mr. Howard.
Tired.
It s a shame, Reverend. It s a damn shame.
Yeah, he ll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
Behold my glory.
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
There are more important matters right now...
Dude, she s eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
About what?
But you guys... It s Salisbury steak.
They re burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
Okay.
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
Cuz, dummy they re Canadian, just like Ike!
Come on, Cartman. It s not your fault.
What?
Tell em we ll have pie and punch.
More people will come if they think there ll be pie and punch!
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
I have to say behind! I get shocked if I say ass OW!!!

Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Uhh... I m here for La Resistance.
Uhh... I don t know.
Uhh... Bacon.
Yeah, I guess.
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
What s a dying giraffe sound like?
We can t leave without you!
I VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
I don t know, dude.
I thought she wasn t your girlfriend, dude.
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
All it says is that it s above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word clitoris.
Wow!
Yeah, so what do we say?
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Well, let s see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
My mother sent YOU a letter? What s it say?
YOU D fuck your uncle!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us! You are a bad man!
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
What s the matter, Wendy?
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
You didn t?
Cool!
Bedrock! I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
Dude, you didn t say anything about watches.
And ze rope?
Oh yeah...
Oh Sara...
It can t be.
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it
My grandfather. My God, I can t tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
Magnificent, magnificent.
So, what brings you out here? Pleasure cruise?
Of course, of course...
Well I guess we re neighbors for this trip.
I was there. Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors. They are not functioning properly.
You didn t do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests. There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty... to report this.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don t know what I d have done without you on this one.
Well, I guess she figures she s paying for it.
It s a little late for you to be up.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Trust me. Even checked em with my own eyes.
I don t know. Everything s up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there s going to be a lot of shuttle work.
That s very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Well, maybe I will. You sure you don t want anything?
Well, maybe I ll surprise you.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking. You don t have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline. Override the airlock sensors and hurry! We re running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3
You better start making sense!
Then we ve got to get to the lifepods!
We have the codes here. How do you want to receive them?
I told you not to try anything smart! I guess you re too much of a maverick to follow a simple order! And that s just too bad for all of you now, isn t it?
That s me.
Seems like they re cooperating. Hopefully I ll be out of here and on my way very soon.
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember? Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
Oh you ll get it, believe me. So I ll see you in a few.
Cool your jets... I m doing a little damage control.
Well blaze your ass out of there! You ve completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
That s clear.
Sheesh! Aye aye cap n!
Yeah, I guess money don t buy class.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
That s right.
Yes. Theoretical discoveries aside, there s nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Well I hope I don t do anything careless.
Actually I ve logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
Well maybe there s a way out of here.
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
It depends on the condition of the ship. If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
Seen one like it before?
Why can t we?
Look I know what I m doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Yeah?
Sure.
A schematic of the ship. Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
A flare? A flare won t do it.
What? What are you talking about?
I m going to try and buy you some time. I can get to the bridge from here.
Don t worry about me. There s still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
I m about to blow the wall.
I ll do my best.
I m staying with the ship. I ll be all right. Now hurry.
Hopefully sooner than later.
We have room! Let s go!
It did. It is. There s nothing we can do about that.
Marry you?
Congratulations on your... recent award.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Well, there s no better to way to see the world, than with us.
There s no time to explain. Get everyone together! We found a way to the pods!
Homesick? It s only been two days!
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
I guess so.
How am I supposed to know?
Baby, take it easy.
Because, Taylor wouldn t do that, that s why.
Certainly. If you need anything, please feel free to ask me. Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available
Certainly. I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
That will not be necessary. You can simply speak to me. I understand most languages fluently.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
You re not from around here, are you?
What kind of man?
Find your bowler?
My father used to say to me " Never... " no, hmmm. " Always... " No, no... Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
The pin machine?
Nope.
Can I get you something for the road?
Orange who? Not from round here, are ya?
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid s hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior s underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don t like no sticky fingers in the till.
La da da dalala...
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life to music!
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
No kiddin.
Gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain t what it used to be. There s something evil spreading in this sport like a big, gigantic, puss ridden
Only problem is, you didn t put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
You don t need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila s gaze.
Theo s bowled on the tour.
We ve been partners a long time now, haven t we Buzz?
Brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch. And now we got a beautiful thing.
Simple math, Buzz. Two plus two does not equal three.
I m sure you have Buzz.
Theo.
I m not on the tour this year.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I m a thorn in their side.
They suspended me for 100 years.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you re the king.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
That game was before you was born.
It s mine.
Grace Skinner.
I got a right. You re my father.
You know what a mixer ball is? It s like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
You shouldn t listen to her, she s a nervous old Nellie.
Kissed a lotta tadpoles. Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I m not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you. Putt putt golf.
The small ball.
Not for me. Miniature golf s for pansies.
What s it look like to you?
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
I m your blood.
Don t say that about my mom!
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
I don t need the stinking pro tour.
I m getting to like it here.
I gotta survive.
You got a better offer?
That s right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown and I get stuck with the seven ten, the Fazeli Split.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I m a living dead legend. I m a hero.
I never saw you.
I m goin straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
I didn t mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I m glad I didn t have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I uh retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
He s not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
Bowlers don t go around killing other bowlers. He s only a fan, Millie. I ll give him some tips and an autograph and he s outta here.
Millie, I know what I m doing.
Hello, mom?
I found dad.
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
Cool!
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother s not around. Somebody blew out Junior s pilot light, if you get my meaning.
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi  ata. If nobody else hadn t a been there, he wouldn t have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
You re prone to violent outbursts, aren t you?
Buzz Fazeli.
You shouldn t touch her.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy bouncy with her.
He told me to play Blue Face with Buzz. I like games.
You played bouncy bouncy with Sheila, so I m gonna play Blue Face with you.
Who s there?
Junior who?
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
Someone wants to play with me?
No!
You know who I am?
I heard you ve been having a little trouble with the Congress. Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
Maybe I can help you. Try a lighter ball, Penelope you ll get hurt with that big ball, honey. I ve seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
Profits down there, philanthropy up here. Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
If it springs a leak, it ll be because Buzz is making waves.
What ever happened to just bowling?
I like the sport the way it is.
How Mr. Kastle?
Why would you help me?
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
That s why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
Look who s talking!
That s right, sugar, find the grip that s right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini green.
Line up where you want it.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
No, no, that s too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It s all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman. His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
Who wants to know? Zeus!
I m sorry about Zeus, Millie.
I couldn t kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
He s my father, Millie.
Where can I find him?
Whips... orange whips.
How do you want it? The eggs.
What do you want with my dad?
Won t your father help you with that?
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
When I m on my bike I feel like a wild person. Better than any sex I ve ever had.
Everything has it s drawbacks.
The mental hospital.
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut hut for a while...
The ladies in Akron call them thigh ticklers.
I d rather you didn t.
Not while I m in training.
No. Do You?
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he s the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
So, what about you?
I don t know. It s all I ever wanted to do.
No, I m fascinated.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
Well, that was plan A.
Plan B is your dad.
He said he d sponsor me.
Nothing.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
Sheila, please.
What s plan C?
It s been awhile. She didn t want me looking for my dad.
So why do you stay?
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I m no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
More than you could afford.
I could let them go for ten.
You re here.
Nope, I couldn t care less.
Why should I help that old fuck.
Zip.
Too late for what, Sheila?
You got any broken bones?
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
Why not?
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
It s Junior, isn t it.
You don t have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron, or anywhere else.
It?
I told him you were my boyfriend.
We would have sooner or later.
If he s not dead, he ll keep coming back.
I feel sick.
Are you sure he s dead?
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
When I m with you Sheila, I don t even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
I killed him once, I ll just have to kill him again.
I didn t come this far to bury a guy that s not my dad. He owes me.
I ve been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he s probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
I m pissing you off? I m doing what I said I d do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
What about plan C?
Your word is so good, you re never gonna give it to anyone.
I m not dumping you, I m suspending you.
I am a professional man.
You bet. For five bucks, I ll even throw in the tongue.
I m not here to bowl.
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Tell your little pal to let go.
Dwarf bowling s illegal.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Your time is up, busyboy.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Open it, Captain!
It s burning...
I can t see...
Back away then.
I said back away.
What is it?
Yeah. I heard you.
But she s
What if it attacks?
What do we use for defense?
High Voltage?
Forty yards.
Sure. Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
That s our reserve air.
Do it, Norman, it s the only choice we have. This thing is gonna crush us.
Captain.
Don t thank me, Dr. Johnson. You weren t my choice. The Pentagon made me take you.
The usual. Plane crash. Survivers unknown. Routine stuff really.
From what? What s with all the security?
Storm? What storm?
A thousand feet.
Survivors? No, I wouldn t think so.
What?
Something like that. That doesn t surprise you?
Geologists?
Wait a second
Hold on
There s got to be some mistake here a four hundred year old military spacecraft? There s no such thing... our space program isn t even forty years old.
It s impossible.
It doesn t make any sense.
What team?
What s wrong with oxygen?
What?
Or maybe, it can t be killed.
I don t know. That s the point.
I m telling you, Harry s lost it. He s saying there s a deathwish out for each of us.
All I m saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
What do you mean, he s missing?
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
How drastic?
I think I do.
She should ve known better.
When was this?
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation
And then brought her down here
The message doesn t show a lack of intelligence. It s smart. It s approaching us in a simple way. Like you would a dog. Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
That s smart. Let s talk about guns and violence.
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
... it raises a very serious question: What happens if Jerry gets mad?
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
Yes, I do. Whatever s out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Maybe so. But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Jerry? Please. Stop this.
Thank you, I can see that. Try something else.
Nothing, sir.
Well, where the fuck is he?
They ve left, keep watching!
To the craft? None. Not a scratch.
Chipped? The door? How can it be chipped?
I thought you said there wasn t any damage done in the crash?
Yes, Harry.
What?
It could. But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
Let s say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe. Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set. There wouldn t be any place to plug it in.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
What s the message?
He s saying, " Take me to your leader. " He wants to know who s in charge.
She s not gonna know.
Radiation shield, you think?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Sir, about leaving
To what?
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions
The sensors are picking up something outside.
What was Edmunds doing outside?
What sub?
I love secrets.
I ve read it twice, Norman. It s brilliant.
That s quite a secret.
C mon, Beth that report s like the blind leading the blind.
Wait down where?
Underwater?
We can t go down there. We re not prepared. That deep? That takes years of training, Beth. We re just scientists. Lab scietists. We wear ties and lab coats to work not oxygen tanks.
It never occurred to me.
The timing has never seemed quite right.
No. Go ahead. Really. Ladies first.
The library.
A bad one. It was the only book in there. Norman, come here, look at this.
My gosh, Norman.
What about you? What happened to you?
Normally, I d say no. Everything s quiet now no ships, no divers, no electricity. Makes sense. But what s curious is these aren t normal jellyfish.
They have six tentacles. A new species. And the squid too. They had no stomach.
What?
Yeah, why?
Beth
They are or they aren t. Which is it?
Beth.
She was crushed. Feel her skin it s like sandpaper.
What are they?
C mon, Beth. Don t make this personal. He told me himself they were taking us back.
So what?
You re jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don t get worked up
Where did you get this?
You went through Edmunds things?
Calm down, Beth. Alright?
What?
You did, didn t you?
You bastard.
Beth
Don t bother me, Norman.
It s also our only way out of here! It holds three people. And there s only three of us left now.
You, me and Harry. He s asleep.
We can t. The storm. The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here. And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
Why should I go?
In case you die, too?
I would. But my suit
You don t trust me?
I can t see anything. How does it look? Still clear?
You fixed this suit? Beth?
My air isn t... I m coming back.
What are you doing in the ship? Beth?
Yeah, well, I get that way when I m facing death and someone deserts me.
Fixing it.
The refridgerator.
It s a pretty common place to look for food when you don t think you have any.
We must ve had it delivered then.
1 800 Deepsea delivery. I hear they re good.
Did you look? It was on the top shelf.
You think?
All I know is I opened that refridgerator
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
I don t know, Beth. I wasn t there.
What?
Squids?
Manifested?
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
You think, in the sphere
But how?
How can the sphere do that?
Which I told Barnes was attacking
But why is he doing it?
His dream? You can t control your dreams. And you can t control your fears, can you?
Something for burns.
Valdomet.
Sintag.
Does it cause drowsiness? That s all we need. To get him unconscious put him under.
Tarazine?
Bingo.
Antihistamine. For bites.
Antibiotic.
How do you spell it?
It s a soporific.
Causes sleep.
How long does it last?
I ll just boost the doses.
How fast does it take effect?
Beth
You want to kill him?
Thirty years ago. In residency. I passed out. You?
For what?
Where are you?
What do you mean, different?
Your watch.
I m feeling better.
You think I d really drink that?
You put explosives around the habitat, I can t imagine what you d put in a drink.
Snakes? What do you mean, exactly?
Am I afraid of them? Not during the day. Sea snakes are diurnal. When the sun s out, they don t bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch. This is quite good.
You tell me.
Don t you?
If I was, then I would ve had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn t I?
What s the phrase " keeping up with the Joneses "?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat. For defense. For the power. To protect myself.
No, he isn t.
No, he can t.
You think I manifested the snakes?
C mon what?
Am I lying? Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure I m lying? Then explain to me about the jellyfish. Earlier. Why did we see jellyfish? Harry doesn t fear jellyfish. You do. They re your fear, aren t they?
And the snakes? You want to know about the snakes? You saw one outside earlier, didn t you? When you thought I had deserted you you were terrified.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
Did I? Or was that you? When you were hiding in the bathroom all conspiratorially like you were you became frightened, didn t you? Terrified. Like you were with the snake earlier and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor. You did that, Norman.
Am I? Or am I making so much sense that you re going insane?
You don t remember you did. But I m sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don t you? You remember that.
You remember before you picked him up when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that when the sphere opened? That s right. But you can t remember going inside, can you? No, of course not. Harry couldn t either, could he? " Like everything s on the tip of my tongue ", he said.
Is it?
No, it isn t. Your name is Norman. But your younger brother what was his name? The one who was stung when you were younger. The one that died. The one you couldn t save. What was his name? " Mommy, we re going out to the ocean to go swimming. " " But I don t want to go swimming, Norman. I m scared. " " C mon, Harry, it ll be fine, it ll be fun. " You heartless fuck. That s why you re so scared of the water, isn t it?
It s not me, Beth. I swear. It can t be.
But I have to, Norman.
Promise what, Norman? Tell me!
You think I d belive you? Believe anything you might say now? After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past. About my problems. My problems. Not yours. Not his. Mine.
It s not safe for you to be either.
Don t fuck with me, Beth.
I know. You re too strong, Beth.
I
Beth gimme the gun.
C mon
What?
Hear what?
Beth
Yes. And I think we already know it will.
Well, think. Because there s footprints here that aren t mine.
All that banging and pounding. I don t know. We should think about making a good first impression.
I never said that.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
That s a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
In time for what?
Like what? I m not
No I m not. I m not star
We can refuse to talk.
Minutes ago. Harry s trying to decode it in his room now.
No idea. We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
What?
Fine. I m fine.
I m not being defensive.
To what?
Which one? Let me get the list out.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
I m completely serious. There is something very important missing from that spacecraft. You know what that is?
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an " Unknown Entry Event. " They didn t know what a black hole was. Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
Meaning we re never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
Am I?
You mean, you think I m cracking?
What noise?
What are you still doing here?
You were all supposed to leave. You weren t supposed to stay down here.
You don t understand about the sphere.
What is it, Harry?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
There s some sort of pattern here. It ll take a minute.
Don t do this. Don t psychoanalyze me. I hate squid. Period. Just like you hate jellyfish.
Did I?
Harry?
I can t breathe... Am I... clear?
What happened to her?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
Her suit s gone.
You didn t say that about the food?
But why would she?
Wisconsin?
How do we decode it?
The three of us.
I don t think so.
Two and a half minutes. Once we re in the sub.
Hurry, Norman. Four minutes.
I m trying to keep balance with
Just pull her down like inside Harry, work with me here!
No idea.
Nine hundred feet to surface.
Good. Thank you. Now that I have it on. Why are you laughing? You don t even know what that means.
You mean forget?
To who? Arthur? Nothing. Nothing that Norman doesn t already know.
What is it, Harry?
Is it some sort of joke? Like one of those hoaxes?
But it s impossible.
Think about it.
Gimme a minute here... I think I ve got it.
If it is an alien spacecraft
Meaning?
Please. It must have flown here
Arrived? From where?
Salt s good for you, Ted. Helps you from getting impotent.
See? No code. What d I say?
No, they didn t say
Captain who?
What report?
Oh, so you re that Dr. Johnson.
Well, everybody s been talking about that report you wrote.
Huh?
You mean you don t know?
Who s everyone?
Geologists? At a plane crash?
Earth doesn t have a patent on buttons, Ted.
You mean a picture?
I don t see anything.
Please, Ted.
This is like nursery school.
The creature?
Barnes didn t know. Couldn t get a reading.
You seen my suitcase?
He didn t say much at all. Honey
Don t be so supportive, honey.
Four. Four years
Keep watching the news. Are you watching the news?
What?
I don t know.
The planet has been totally blown away! It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I ve ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I d know about it.
Well, I ve brought you here. What now?
Who s going to pay me then?
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you ll be able to name the reward...
Fear is their greatest weapon.
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures. Both of you will have to learn...
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan shielded compartments.
Is that good or bad?
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know. If you don t find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn t it?
We ll be back before you are, old man.
What do you mean, good morning? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I m not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
Couldn t we have tried to think of something else first!
Oh, so you re a warrior then?
I know that.
You could put it that way.
I know your intentions. I probably know much more about you than you realize. In many ways you re a lot like your father. He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior. Now what brings you out here?
But you must! I can t do it alone. I m not at all like my father. I d never make it.
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R 2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important. They re probably looking for him... I m no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi s work. This is your responsibility!
My father used to talk about the Force of Others. But he never told me what it was...
You mean I generate an energy field?
What do you mean?
But you re still a powerful Jedi. You don t need my help.
How can you store an energy field within you?
Don t you have a Kiber crystal?
That s where my father was killed.
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
I doubt it. It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings. You d best forget them. It s for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan. It s the heart of the Sith. The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
I rarely use it any more. I have the Force. The Force is more powerful than any pistol. You shouldn t put too much faith in that weapon. Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you. Try to sense what it s telling you. It s the only thing you can rely on.
You mean we should go after her!...
Try to feel it. Use the Force...
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help. I must try to find the Crystal.
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
At least you re doing something... I d give anything to be in your position.
Yes, your highness. I ll let you open it then. It won t be too long before they figure out what happened to us. This has turned into a brilliant escape!
Then I think we re due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we ve been through.
What s that little droid carrying that s so blasted important?
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
The fourth moon of Yavin. I ve given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
You don t believe in the Force?
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don t think anyone would dare try.
You re good with remotes, but how are you against something living?
Why didn t you say so before.
Let s try this way! Holy Maker.
They must be shielded somehow. I m sure the base is there.
You ll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can t hold me!
They ll find its weakness.
I... I don t know. I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help. I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
I will, but I ll have enough time to transmit my application first.
But you promised! I ve saved enough money and now you have the extra help... you promised!
You used my savings! You stole my savings. If my father were here...
I m sorry, sir, I m only a droid, and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I m not even sure which system we re on.
That s how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
If you don t mind my saying so, sir, I don t see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Can you stand? We ve got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits. Perhaps they might bring something.
I read you sir.
I m afraid we re not plugged in at the moment, sir. We ve had some problems.
For the moment. We re in the main hangar. Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
Are you there, sir? We re going...
What an honor...
Something... I ve got... you don t.
Oh, yeah? I don t see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
It s what I deserve.
I joined up for her. I wouldn t even be here if it wasn t for her. I m a fool.
He was our teacher... He was great.
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Sir, no, sir.
Sorry, son. I can t do it. You signed the 1240 / A. It would be illegal.
What s the hurry?
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn t want that?
Your father will never let you.
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are?
If you can t do those numbers, you haven t got a chance.
Bugs laid a trap, didn t they?
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren t you?
This isn t simulation anymore. Take er out easy, cadet.
They revoke our flight status.
No, I replotted the course. It s more efficient this way.
Don t change the subject. Am I right?
Don t mess with the boss. So what d the captain say?
THERE! GRAVITY FIELD... IT S BIG!
You weren t thinking... you were dreaming!
There s a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
Funny...
No, funny there s almost no wounded at all.
A funeral.
Yeah.
I don t know, Zander.
It wasn t luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Who?
Well, at least you didn t lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Don t be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
I don t want everyone to see.
How come that s all you talk about anymore?
Why not?
Carl can wait.
It s not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don t need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He s a veteran.
How do I know if this is love?
Yeah, sure, I guess.
What are you talking about? We both know you re gonna be a pilot.
I can t help it.
Who cares?
I ll miss you, too, Johnny.
What do you think? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don t like it, do you?
I try just to be happy I m still alive.
Should I be?
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can t be bothered to spit.
That was just a mix up.
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it?
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Sure.
Guess you gotta go.
No thanks, Diz.
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
Flip six, three hole.
I don t stay where I m not wanted.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you re only proving one thing, Johnny.
Nah, I don t do that anymore...
I said no. Want me to pull rank?
All bands.
No, you re gonna be alright, Diz!
We ll all have dinner. I ll fix your favorite.
Looks like rain.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station!
Good, because you re going to Harvard, and that s the end of it.
I won t quit!
Fleet s pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They d like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
Sir, thank you, sir!
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
Hi, mom.
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private?
This is a Fleet driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh?
I m gonna save Carmen.
Not a problem.
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
Uh, I don t know.
What is it, Rico?
Well, it s not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
Good for you. Go find out.
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don t you remember? I was captain of the team.
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir...
Yes, sir!
V ger is that which programmed me.
Who is V ger?
The carbon units infection will now be removed from the Creator s planet.
The Creator has not answered.
Not until V ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
Because V ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
Answer!
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise s proper evolvement.
By the Creator.
V ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir that it s ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
They reach final position in... Twenty seven minutes mark.
You are what...?
You, personally, are assuming command?
May I ask Why?
None available, Captain. There s no one in fact, who s fully rated on this design.
Thank you, sir. I m sorry I embar rassed you.
I m aware of that, sir.
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Of course not. I m aware of Mister Spock s qualifications.
How do you define unwarranted, mister?!
It s taken control of the computer...!
Captain, we can t be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
Capture God! In order to retrieve V ger s data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
It s a programmed mechanism, Mr. Spock...
No more than I expected Not as difficult as this. I m sorry...
If I d seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Twelve seconds...!
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
We re already two settings below that, sir.
Why aren t the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
And whatever you sensed out here....
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
... they may have followed it too precisely.
I am seeking answers, Captain.
And these sensor swarms collect that data, carry it here.
No meaning... No hope... And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it s looking for answers itself!
The point...
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
To you, sir?
Annie... got an umbrella...?
I ll be there.
Sure plan to.
He ll eat potroast and like it.
I need a typewritter.
Why don t you buy it, only forty bucks.
Who?
That s why they have state borders... whyn t you get a replacement?
You buy the typewriter, I ll get it all spruced up, good as new. Better than new. It has some history.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
What s it called?
You quit.
Why did you quit?
Don t be so hard on yourself.
Well. Everybody has reversals. If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
Yes.
It s about life.
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
That s true. You grow up here?
Yes.
Yes...
No, no, I see...
Yes...
I understand...
As the Old Mill goes around...
Of course.
That s that s that s that s beautiful...
And likewise.
No, no. Of course, that s exactly what it represents...
Everyday things... yes.
I live there.
Mmm.
Yes...
Well, I guess I ll... get down to the station. It was lovely meeting...
What are you doing? I love your script.
You re still here.
You d know better n me.
It s in your script... it s about getting a second chance. Innit? " You can go back... "
You bet your life. " The mill wheel goes around... some times it s even under water then it rises up, as high as it can go... "
Yes...
That s why you didn t want to take the Mill out... you ve...
The Firehouse...
But but but but but it s better without...
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see? And you get a second chance!
What are you doing tonight?
I thought you had Play Practice.
Well, then, it don t look good for the Huskies...
Cast stood me up.
What?
My glasses fell apart. I lost the...
Never saw the point of em.
Paperclip?
" Room Service! "
Oh, God...
I don t drink.
Read the card.
The other side.
Why?
Oh. That s alright. Then I ll come back at a better time. What would be a better time?
Then I ll come back, then.
Because I d met someone else.
You believe that?
So is our electoral process. But we still vote.
I used to go out with a politician.
Sure did.
Time for a change. Keep your margins straight.
I can t get it to come out right.
It used to be the Old Mill.
Please...
She realizes it was not the fire which hurt him... that the true hurt was her. Was her...
... her unbridled sexuality. That he...
That s... that s exactly what it s about. Take...
Hi.
What?
... how else can you talk?
Is it...
Gosh, you look nice.
It does?
You d do the newspaper right here.
You know what else a man can do?
Sleep well?
Oh yeah.
Yes...
Now you re talking...
... well, we do that anyway...
... the better to eat me with, your dear?
Not without a rolltop desk.
Happen to know where there s one for sale.
You got to tell em that you saw the accident. Don t you?
But that s what happened.
Maybe they ll be other movies.
Carla was in the car, right?
If I go to jail...?
Morning, darling.
Water or mineral deposits.
After Drama Group.
Tuesdays and Thursdays. But after Play Practice, I m yours.
What is it, a surprise?
Yes, that s right.
What are they offering?
That s so beautiful...
We had a date.
Where have you been...
Where have you been, we had a date for three... where have you been...?
Well, I know, because they told me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole town has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a date, they call, you re doing business nine o clock at night. It isn t...
Oh. What were you doing, then, that s so important that you shouldn t call your fian...
Wai... It s so serious you couldn t call to tell me you d be... what...? What did you say...?
Let me review here: You re... what are you... you ve... it s all over between us?
Who is this person that you ve found?
No. Don t tell me that.
That a fact. Now, is it a good play?
Well, then, what s he doing here?
Courthouse back in town.
What?
Mitch, th Marty Rossen, I m here in...
You told me that about the last town.
I m bleeding, Bill, I m bleeding...
... you got to get me that street for nothing...
... they run on water.
Fifteen hands.
This horse is booked.
Uh, look....
She wasn t in the...
... I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
I never touched her. My mother s gr...
What ll I do for fun?
No, I was, I was, I was just learning on, it s a...
I loved it... he...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
I don t eat vegetables.
Sure, what have you got?
Bourbon and Milk.
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
I...
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
He s saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Tell it with pictures.
She s a...
What...
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don t need...
You can go...
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
And you go start with that stuff in this town...
Well, yeah, I m fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don t know, it s a schoolnight, something...
Joe, the writer?
I ve always seen that.
How could she turn on me like that? I thought she liked me.
Well. What seems to be the...?
Of course he...
I m an attorney, if there s anything you have to say to...
Well, Officer, don t worry ab...
It s night.
There s other things to be learned.
The Mayor s outside.
Thank you.
I think he s moved...
Who is it raped you?
I wasn t in the car.
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
He s on the Island, he ll be back on...
I really think that business... matters should be discussed between you t...
She s absolutely r...
I, actually yes.
Why?
I feel so close to you...
I like you, too.
But we...
Who is that...?
Oh.
She came in here, wait, she... I was giving her a massage... wait... Wait! She came in here... she...... with respect... she took off her clothes, and she got in bed, I told her I could not we don t know each other, you see...
I just...
Don t let me dis... I ll just...
Yes, but, Joe, Joe s been, well, he s just been having a few, uh, " Thoughts, " about...
Yeah.
Yes, yes, but...
I can t do it, Walt.
It isn t right. I can t... I... I know I si... I, they, I don t know if they told me it was in the con...
I don t want to take my shirt off in that con... What are these things that they re asking of me...? Wha... wha... wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
... they treat me like a child. I, I... to bare my body.
I... I...
Listen to me: Elanora Duse was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket. She said, " I m not doing the seven shows a week I signed for. " She said, " I cannot bare my soul seven times a week. I am an artist. I ll do four shows a week. " The greatest actress of her time. You know what her Producer said?
Nothing. He held her and he wept. Because he...
... and, and, and did she...? And she did the seven shows...
... yes...
Yes.
We, we have to give it.
What? I have a five o clock plane to catch.
I...
I m only trying to...
The minute I read that script I said...
... she works with animals, she...
... she has a home...
He treated me as if I were a child...
... he s right here, Mr. Mayor...
I ll put the, in your r...
Bob Barrenger... Bob... Bob Barrenger s in this movie?
He s staying here? Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
Main Street.
I want you to hear this, pal... Forget the overages, forget Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks. You know what it would cost for them to build this set? Two Million Dollars! Now:
What is the...?
... a history of nothing, he was acquitted...
You ve got nothing, you don t have a witness...
He told you that...
I want to talk to him. Would you ex...
Later for you, pal.
I d prefer it if you didn t speak to me.
I was in New Hampshire. I was at the Old Location.
I can t write it. I lost my typewriter.
I can only write on a manual.
Well, you know, you know, that s a lie, I, I...
That s a real fault, I...
I know you do.
Hey, it s with the Gods. We don t have the money, we have to write it out. The best or not. And that s a lesson. You get your typewriter yet...?
I don t drink.
I hurt my finger.
I m gonna nail it.
You want me to lie.
I m out.
The girl was in the car.
It s not you, it s...
I have to tell the truth.
The girl was in the car.
So be it.
For what cause?
I really don t think you should be talking this way to a lady.
I...
No.
I didn t say anything to them.
I don t know.
I don t...
I...? I saw it. I was there.
What glasses were you wearing? Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
... the house, the 1835. The original kitchen, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
I left that for you.
What d you do, build this...?
We re flying over pigs, we re flying over sheep...
They re coming Fedex...
My undies, cause, you can t get this picture off on time I m gonna wet myself.
That s what I said.
Pay her.
Find the money.
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
We don t have the money.
If you do the product placement...
" Bazoomer dot com. "
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
Is that one hell of a kid?
He s got a gift for fiction.
There s no witnesses...
That we could use you in and I think that s quite a fine trade off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the director...
I don t want to invite someone else, because this is the most exclusive...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
I signed the permit. I don t know how I can.
And we re glad to have you here...
Aren t these illegal?
That s very kind of... as a matter of fact, one, I hate to bother you with...
... we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
... the city council...
... it is?
George, that is so kind of you.
Yes, I hear it.
It takes all kinds.
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
He s been playin Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
Bet you did.
Ain t no second chances in life.
... we can t lose the wind...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it. You want me to " push in. " Or I can lose the shot.
But, Wally, the window of the firehut...
I don t care.
I hate when you say that.
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
Well you re telling your teachers and your friends
Maybe you re upset that Rachel moved in.
It happens.
That will never happen.
... why do you think?
What are you gonna talk about?
Then why are you putting on mascara?
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
No I m not. I don t care. Why should I care? I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced. Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother. Nobody even asked me if I like her. If you guys don t care about our family staying together, why sh...
Like how?
Like a big sister.
A debate. Man s inhumanity to woman. He s pro women. I m con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
Great.
Every time I m on the lunch yard, and he s with twelve of his retarded dorkface little adoring out crowd henchmen...
Not with my mouth open.
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
Mom? What s wrong?
You cannot believe what he said, it was the worst instant of my total life on Earth!!
And bring my knees up, real hard, yeh?
I m not.
Yes.
I ll miss you so much.
I didn t forget. I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you re too special to look like everyone else. Orange Red. That s your color. Few can carry it off. Now please. Help me find your brother.
Here.
This is my daddy s house
Just where I wanna be all Saturd...
But we re hungry and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant! It starts at seven!
That s so weak.
Why don t you say hello?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn t bother me.
You think this is funny?
You re just a stepmother. So stop bossing, cos nobody s listening!
Not use my words, please!
Uh. He thinks his nose is too big. But it s not.
Oh. It s an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I d never let you go to. But it s real. Does he have an older brother?
But Rache...
Ice cold water.
There you are!
Cos she loves you.
No.
Then have a donut
Aren t you going to drink your cocoa? It s the good kind.
 quot; And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...  quot;
Well, that s a long way off, sweetie. We ll talk to Mom and Dad...
I have lava.
No, that s your fault. It s her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority. Which means, the most important job.
Ben, mommies work too. They work very hard. Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working. I just don t get paid.
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
Yes... if you like big hair...
What honey?
Honey, this is Thursday. I pick you up tomorrow, and we do big spaghetti.
Yes.
I did. Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn t cook it, she did.
You have the WORST flu since...
That s Rache s song!
No! I have to get there.
Before you.
How do you know?
Rache says it s from you.
But you can still see him.
Can I talk to you? When you re there.
You ve got a fruit loop in your hair.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother s head
Look, I will send a P. A. to pick up the children. There are agencies that supply sitters, nannies...
No, no, no, this is a job that s hard to keep, not a job that s hard to lose, can t be both.
I m here.
I m here. I ve got a case where they re this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he s now living with a woman half his age
We re not discussing your age.
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up
It s Wednesday night. She s at my house. I ll talk to her.
I m worried.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don t you take the weekend...... that way you ll be there, and I ll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Easy enough.
You re WHERE?
Jackie, we were taking them water skiing for the whole weekend!
Do you realize what could have hap pened to your son today? How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did? He could have been...
Not to me.
I m not gonna wait around to see the next one. I m not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement. I m seeing a lawyer.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She s amazing in it.
To make it easier for them or you?
You can t be an us just when you want to. You can t play that card when it s convenient.
WE are over.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
We re going to win this.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays. I got it right here...
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
What is this? The Betty Ford Center?
Maybe you could back off just a little bit
... a ridiculously expensive and inappropriate item, which her father and I have already told her she is far too young to own. But you apparently want to buy her forgiveness, with...
I m sure that didn t upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
No. I thought it might be uncomfortable for her
You re damn right. I m gonna sick of your imperious bullshit. I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker. If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month go ahead! I have a life!
Maybe the problem is your kids. Maybe they re spoiled, coddled brats!
But it s not on the schedule!
Look, I...
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
I m sorry. Look, I m not real comfortable being here, but...
I didn t need you to take the blame for me, I m quite...
You re not terribly good at taking care of h...
I m already on thin ice. Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Not personally.
Hey. At least it s not an editing machine.
Anxiety.
She was angry at herself.
Yes?
You re not working at Random House, I talked to them.
Don t flatter yourself.
Nobody likes a snoop.
How the hell would you know?
See, I know that.
You re a cross dresser.
... going out, yeh. I had kids of my own, once.
Right. Which is the whole point of this going out thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
You look sick. But you look... together. Mentally tough.
And you said...
Yeh, she s... I ll get you Ben first, it s past his bedti...
Do what you ve worked your whole life to do?
Juggle it! Move the darkroom into your house. You ve got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway. Don t lose your confidence. Don t lose your edge.
I just want to spend time with them when I m not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
And her...?
Is that what he told you?
Are we.
It doesn t matter, I didn t tell h...
Is that what you re worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
Aw.
That s not wh...
You weren t passing em out.
Oh please.
She wasn t steering her own course, she was steering yours.
No, there isn t.
Come on, a wuss like me? The stiff who wouldn t help her own daughter fight back?
I lost him. I was panicked.
What do I have that you don t?
You re the hip and fresh.
You ll learn.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
We have to talk.
I didn t want to spoil our supper...
So I ll have to order in?
For what?
I can take them to work with me I can shift things around
I trust you of course I do but
But you re not good at this. Not yet. I m sorry.
They don t hate you
Nobody s telling them to hate you
It s complicated for Jackie. It s complicated for me... You don t have kids you don t understand
No you don t. And I m not gonna screw with my kids heads right now
Uh. Annabelle s video report has been switched again.
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o clo...
And it s my call. I promised them water skiing, instead o...
Rache, get out of th...
I think so... What do you think?
Okay... Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Rache, it may take time.
It s Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
Well, they will be.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
... while she watched the kids. Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family s summer. But she said...
By way of saying you were unhappy.
That s not us.
Does Jackie know this?
In seven years Jackie s never missed one of Tucker s parties. Where is she?
Maybe he s gay.
What if he is?
What?
Hey. What s up?
What?
Like what?
Oh.
He was in a concentration camp?
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
Conan O Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
I ll be your guest!
Thank you.
Great to be here.
Well, I was thinking... I might work for you.
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk show host.
Yes, Mikey?
Yes.
Four brothers and five sisters.
It was God s will.
I did not go to high school.
We had to work. My family was poor.
I m still poor.
No, Mikey.
I m always working.
This is work.
No.
Mi Jesus  mi jesus 
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
My Jesus 
My baby.
My grandchild baby.
He s dead.
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
Poison gas.
Jesus was not bad.
He wasn t.
I am sure.
I know!
Well, I m not really sure what you re trying to say. It s funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
You re showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
You think so? You don t think that this might not be a little dry?
Yes, I know  But still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is serious  But don t you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
Nothing, I guess 
OK, you re right, you re right  You know, we need to screen what we ve got  invite some regular people, just some random off the street types  and see what real people think of this.
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better 
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
Yes, Mikey?
What?
Look, we re not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
Is everything OK?
Fine.
What s tomorrow?
Huh?
You mean, again?
Oh. What happens now?
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
Marcus, I m tired. That s all.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Don t be so upset. It s OK...
You know he hated my story also.
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn t have read it. I knew it was shit. But idiot! I believed you!
Well, I sure didn t hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
The same.
Yeah?
One in a million recover.
Thanks.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Hi, Dad!
Gee, you re home early!
What are you doing here?
Uh huh.
Good. Cause I... um... I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
Thank you. So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
I m not going out with Catherine.
No.
Say, Ni...
... gger.
Say, Nigger. '
' Fuck me hard! '
Say, Nigger, fuck me hard! '
Again!
Again!!
Hello, is this Pam?
Toby Oxman.
Oh, fine. How are you?
Great!
That s what I was gonna ask you.
Oh, yeah, well... um... I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
Um, well, yeah. So are you still acting?
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke and a rip off, so, uh... so I dropped out.
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I d been really into I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it s finished.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like I mean, I have some dignity.
I m a documentary filmmaker.
N not yet. I m hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Oh, I don t remember that...
Yeah... um... so anyway, tell me. What about you? I d heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Three.
Eight, six, and four.
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
It s my Dad s He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
I know.
I m not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
Yeah?
Yeah. I know.
No... Actually, I m a documentary filmmaker?
Well, no. I m doing one on high school students, in fact.
Well... it s kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Yeah, well, it s possible they would be interested in it.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
So where d you get in?
But what did you get on your SATs?
Uh, yeah, we re getting there.
Sure  um  yeah, as soon as I have a screening I ll let you know.
He did?
Th they want t twenty f five million dollars cash or Chemco will be destroyed.
Th th they ll kill one hostage every hour until it is
Y yes
Well, I I hope that that
I now understand the expression " you get what you pay for! " A bunch of chumps!
Well get someone down there!
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It s a bunch of businessmen touring a lab. We ll be out in no time.
I m not arguing. I m just telling you what the deal is Congresswoman.
We don t have time!
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me. He s loyal to the end. Even if it s not politically correct at the time.
What do you think?
What happened?
What are you talking about?
Because I ll be firing at them.
Well Cooper...
We re on sublevel six. We ll pass some labs and then we ll hit the stairwell
I don t see why they wouldn t be.
It s nothing to worry about.
Where does it lead?
Are you going to kill us?
You re going to pay for this...
I don t want any...
The ball is in Richter s court. But we re sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people we re gonna stop the son of a bitch!
What do you mean?
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn t be shelved in a lab somewhere...
I haven t been briefed on any such thing!
What the hell is it, anyhow?
What!
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck em we don t need em.
We re almost done piping in directly to the Olympia. Should have it all in about an hour or so.
Gotcha. We ve been filling barrels all day we ve got hell of a stockpile.
I say we head out.
Are you hungry? We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Why should I worry? Is there a problem?
Dissent?
If I don t get power up we are!
We can t it s power driven!
Uh, well, what d she say? Is Pony coming?
I don t anymore.
Yeah.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It s kind of like AA.
Intense.
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I m rehabilitated.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I d kill myself first.
Yeah.
Well, sure, he s rich and he s famous. He s got everything and you ve got nothing.
Yeah, I guess.
Mm hm.
Was it okay?
What did you guys think?
Typical male.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn t get you in trouble.
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
Hey, you said you did a video?
What s it about?
Oh. Well, what s it on?
A cloud?
Oh.
Oh, that s so amazing. I wish I could see it.
Yeah, I m a nurse s aide at Mercy.
No, I, you know, I help em out. I empty bedpans and bring em lunch. That kind of thing.
Oh, some of em. But it s mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they re, you know, really yellow.
Oh, no, it s not. I mean, they re not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I m helping them.
Right now?
I don t know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Now?
I don t smoke dubes and I don t really hang out. But I ll go back. Okay.
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half dead Bangladeshi.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
And your mom.
Where are you hoo?
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
What?
No, uh, nobody. It s, uh, it s my birthday this week and Sooze s brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
Yeah.
That s the rock star thing.
Oh, I ll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
Sorry.
You wanna bet he s with a girl?
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it s so huge!
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
I wouldn t. If I were in his shoes, every morning I d get up singing, man. Do my work out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I d order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all black leather Victoria Secret custom made bodysuit. So I d, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she d have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from em. And then she d take out this half ounce of blow, we d snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we d watch Captain Kirk.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn t love it!
Ah!
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
Okay, okay.
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
No, no.
No, no, I wasn t trying.
No, I m not, I m not worried. I m not worried.
No, I m not worried.
Uh, Buff, I m, I m, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
No, I mean, no one.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
Uh, last night...
No, no.
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
No.
Buff, listen to me. Could you just
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
You know?
What, they re looking for her?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn t happen.
No. It didn t, Buff.
Erica is in the van back there.
Look.
She s in the van.
Buff...
She s dead.
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Tim killed Erica. Tim s a murderer.
No, no, no.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Let s go look, then. Let s go look, then!
Guess not.
No.
Come on.
So, how was the ride, kids?
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Sure I am. It s fun.
Well, that s one way of putting it.
Shit.
In what way?
I m so burnt out.
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L. A.
I can come visit?
I will.
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven twenty. Seven twenty.
We re your customers. We re not complaining.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It s ours. You don t belong here.
Are you talking to me?
Glad it s okay.
Um, if you re talking to me, could you make some sense? Cause I don t speak Swahili.
Good. See you later.
You re wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That s okay.
Oh, you were there?
Naw, naw, we don t have time for all that.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it s a song about...
Please.
Oh, yeah, all the time. That s what I do now.
" Closed, closed, closed. " But with your music.
I could.
Yeah.
Yes!
I didn t want to eat this much, man.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Okay.
It s nice here. It s different.
Hi.
No, not really. I come from an " area ". Bel Air.
No, not really. Middle class.
He is?
He is.
What d he get you?
Mm.
What about me? I don t have a car.
Military marching bands.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don t know me.
Oh, yeah?
Really?
Mm.
You cut off your little finger?
What was your name again?
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
It s a mistake to think that.
It s nice to do a lot of things.
I m not a nice guy.
Yeah?
No, no, see, you, you don t understand.
Taking care of business.
Oh, sure.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Jeff, Erica. God, it s so amazing to be back home.
We were?
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Two fifty? They go up?
He s drunk.
Yeah, well, he s from a Third World country. He doesn t have it easy.
Hey, he s a human being you can give him that much.
Who were you talking to?
Sooze wants to see him.
Right on. You know what? He doesn t need the limo, man.
Okay, great. Well, now he s crying. Are you guys happy?
I m not suffering, you know. I don t give a shit.
No.
What?
Yeah, fuck em.
No, no. I m not, I m not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
That chick, Erica?
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, " Tim, Tim, what s the matter? I love you. Don t go! " And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin... Oh, man, I really...
I hit her.
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin her till she didn t move anymore.
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn t she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you ll buy anything. It s true. Look at you. You re gullible and you re gutless.
Wow. You did that for me?
Well, you know, all I can say is, you re a fucking fool.
Oh, shit.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn t even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
I m a loser. And I m drunk. But I m not gutless.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
You don t know?
Come on. You don t think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
Just go home, alright?
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
They re just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
Will you just put the gun down?
He s got a gun. He s got a gun.
Is that Bee Bee?
Seven twenty.
I don t know.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn t understand what is going on with me.
That s right.
Look, why do you care, huh?
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
I don t know. I think she s breathing.
You could ve come over.
I hate that.
No. I m not going to the van, it s so gross. Come on. I m doing my performance right now.
No.
Man?
It s a piece.
I don t want to hear it anymore.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He s been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
So you can give me more shit?
About what?
Like what?
Name one.
One!
Hey!
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
But do you stand for anything?
What? What do you stand for?
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
You know, all you know is what s good for you.
Well, if you love him so much, why didn t you go see him play?
Like I m going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would ve done something.
Yeah.
I would ve stopped it.
I don t know. I would ve done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn t it? This place is so stupid. I can t believe we re sitting here in this mosh pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Us.
And?
No, no, see, that s not what I m saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what s the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
Nothing.
Okay, well, then, I m gonna break new ground.
Mm hm.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don t need that. Why? What s your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
So, what, why can t you do that here? What s wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
Mm mm.
No, no.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
Yes, you do.
You do.
Jeff!
No. No, no, no.
No, I just don t feel like it. That s all.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
But wait! Sooze, I don t wanna fight. I m so sorry.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
And I fig and I figured something out.
I, yeah.
God, you smell like whiskey.
I m leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
For a ride.
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
Well, what about us?
No, maybe not though. That, that s what I m trying to say.
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
' Bye, Jeff.
What?
Hey, man. Jeff. How re you doin?
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing s changed.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it s dumb, I know, it s just...
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Oh yeah, yeah, we re starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we re gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It s hard work, you know?
The road s hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom s?
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
So how s college?
What?
Like songs?
Yeah. You should show em to me.
Yeah, really.
Well, not exactly.
What do you mean?
I don t know. Uh, I m an artist, I guess. You know, there s life and then there s the people watching the life, commenting on it.
What?
Well, I, I didn t say I was special, but it s one thing, you know, and it s another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it s me, okay? I come out here and I m, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I m a fucking star, man, and I m really sorry if I m full of attitude. I, I really...
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
Camel jockey.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You re gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Hey!
Oh, it s stupid, isn t it.
It s stupid.
Look at you!
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head s in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
Oh, yeah?
It s pretty exciting.
Yeah.
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L. A. It s, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
New York, huh?
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you d do in study hall.
Oh, uh, we re gonna go in the studio and we re, we re doin a new album.
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
I don t want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
I m always serious.
I get final approval. It s in my contract.
Yeah, we d have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can t believe you re still here.
If...
Yep.
I don t know. I say what I mean.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they re doing.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we ll be working on that album cover, right?
You do?
Yeah?
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Pal, she s a big girl, you know? I m sure she s alright.
About what?
She didn t say. Maybe she s at the bar at the hotel.
Whatever.
It s none of my business?
Don t do that.
If you hit me...
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
It s not the air force anymore, Scuff
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
Hey, Tim.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Uh, excuse me, I d like to know where he gets his ideas.
Yeah. Yeah, I m jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol Pony ride back to the hotel.
I just pulled and it it came off.
Sorry, Kansas...
Oh for Chrissakes... " White trash Betty. " I didn t realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Cleo!
Forget it. I ve got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head. I won t risk it.
Cleo, I ve already thrown up twice today could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
My fault What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
Di? I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
No I don t... I keep asking because I feel fat.
You sure?
And they get caught!
If you don t can you still afford to go to Harvard?
So then this isn t crazy. It s a sure bet.
She thinks you went to the police.
I don t know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
Spit from your dad?
Yeah.
Y think?
Diane, I ve loved you ever since I first saw you right before you kicked me in the head.
Jack...
Trix...
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
That was gas, Sweetie.
Uh, " no "... You re not fat.
Stop, you re gonna make me cry.
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you ve got three more pointing back at you.
That you?
Just call me later. I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Okay. How much ammo you reckon you ll need?
Bullets.
You re kidding.
Or, I could get my own horse...
We re dead! They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
It wasn t like the prison we saw all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they d lived! Oh G d, I m gonna be someone s bald bitch!
Yeah. " Itchy " sent us.
Definitely old.
Wait a minute. You watched the Apple fucking Dumpling Gang?!
Uh... maybe?
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
So could half the women in here. And I d rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for? To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
My what?
Now how the hell can I help you?
Gee, I ll sit out this afternoon s coffee talk. Whaddya want?
Well, shit fire, Kansas, that s the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom! Like my life ain t a great big pile of shit cause you re in here? Now I have to add, " P. S. My mom s a dyke " too?
Hey, don t " mouthy shit " me I m outta here.
More proof God s a guy...
Hi, Artie.
In a deep freeze.
Let it ride for a while.
That was the general idea.
The greatest. They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors. Hey, easy on the punch bowl. Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
I ll take it.
I m sorry about New Year s. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
What s wrong with it?
Nothing for Ladd?
I m sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don t think it s any good. I found it flat and banal.
That was last year. This year I m trying to earn a living.
Thanks.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
Why, you sweet kid.
Dark Windows. How did you like it?
Thank you.
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
Maybe that s why it s good. It s true, it s moving. Now why don t you use that character...
Drop that attitude. Here s some thing really worth while.
I m serious. I ve got a few ideas.
As for instance?
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta. Or should we just turn on the shower?
Are you hungry?
O. K. I find I m terribly afraid of losing you.
You ll be waiting for me?
I haven t been keeping myself at all. Not lately.
Is that so? What s the wonderful news?
What teacher?
You did?
Into what? A lampshade?
Where s the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It s really just a springboard. It needs work.
I tell you this is half sold.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
Why should you do that?
You know, I d take you up on that in a minute. I m just not good enough to do it all by myself.
See if they make sense. To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff exploring a killer s sick mind.
This story is about teachers their threadbare lives, their struggles. Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re sole their shoes. To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
I ll make it short.
I m not good enough to write it alone. We ll have to do it together.
Couldn t we work in the evenings? Six o clock in the morning? This next month I m completely at your disposal. Artie is out of town.
We re engaged.
I think so. They re on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I m free every evening, every week end. If you want, we could work at your place.
You re tough, all right.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
Are you kidding? Because I think it s good.
What s good about it? I miss him something fierce.
It will?
Don t you sometimes hate yourself?
Who s who?
Oh, that. It s from a friend of mine. A middle aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
What were you a child actress?
Second generation, huh?
Nice job.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Come clean, Betty. At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
It must be my new shampoo.
Twenty two.
Was I? I m sorry.
Something came up. I don t want to talk about it.
I just don t.
It s nothing. I got a telegram from Artie.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there. It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
I don t want it now.
Of course I love him. I always will. I m just not in love with him any more.
I don t know why I m so scared, Joe. Is it something awful?
This is where you live?
Whose?
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Why did she call me?
I didn t come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
No.
No, no! I haven t heard any of this. I never got those telephone calls. I ve never been in this house... Get your things together. Let s get out of here.
Come on, Joe.
If you love me, Joe.
Joe, I can t look at you any more.
You d better. I m very angry.
That s no excuse. You read the script, didn t you?
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
Don t play innocent. Somebody named Gordon Cole.
And if you hadn t been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn t have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
Nothing. I just didn t realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio. I had no idea how I d missed it.
We ll be working again, won t we, Chief? We ll make our greatest picture.
It s a good script, isn t it?
I don t care about the money. I just want to work again. You don t know what it means to know that you want me.
It is not. Get out.
Get out.
I know your face. You re Norma Desmond. You used to be in pictures. You used to be big.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
That s where the popcorn business comes in. You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Don t get sore at me. I m not an executive. I m just a writer.
Yeah?
I think that s what it says on my driver s license.
Depends on what it is a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Looks like enough for six impor tant pictures.
And you ll play Salome?
Only asking. I did t know you were planning a comeback.
Fair enough.
They ll love it in Pomona.
Right now? Never let another writer read your stuff. He may steal it.
This is fascinating.
Maybe it s a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you re not a professional writer.
Sure you did. That s what makes it great. What it needs is a little more dialogue.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
Of course not. But it ought to be organized. Just an editing job. You can find somebody.
I don t know.
December twenty first.
Thank you.
Me? I m busy. Just finished one script. I m due on another assignment.
I wouldn t worry about money. I ll make it worth your while.
Oh no. I couldn t let it out of my house. You ll have to finish it here.
Are you married, Mr.?
Where do you live?
There s something wrong with your car, you said.
You can stay here.
Look, I m supposed to fix up your script. There s nothing in the deal about my staying here.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
I ll take care of that.
I m used to paying my own bills.
Okay. We ll deduct it from my salary.
Unpack nothing. I didn t say I was staying.
Just a scene I cut out.
The one where you go to the slave market. You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist
Honestly, it s a little old hat. They don t want that any more.
Not now, my dear. I m playing three no trump.
Please. Now I ve forgotten how many spades are out.
I ve lost my car.
It is to me. That s why I came to this house. That s why I took this job ghost writing!
What s wrong with It?
I don t need any clothes, and I certainly don t want you buy ing them for
I don t need a tuxedo.
Tails. That s ridiculous.

I don t like those studs they ve sent. I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Who?
There are no other guests. We don t want to share this night with other people. This is for you and me.
Come midnight, how about blind folding the orchestra and smash ing champagne glasses on Max s head?
A little.
What s that?
" Mad about the boy. "
Shut up. I m rich. I m richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I ve got a million dollars.
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield pumping, pumping, pumping. What s it for but to buy us anything we want.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I m crazy about?
Why not? What I m trying to say is that I m all wrong for you. You want a Valentino somebody with polo ponies a big shot
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her self for Unknown Writer.
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake. I didn t want to hurt you. You ve been good to me. You re the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
I m not just selling the script. I m selling me. DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
They re awful. They make me cough.
I ran into some people I knew.
Nothing is the matter. I m having a great time. Show me some more.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
I don t think so. It s your script. It s your show. Good luck.
Good night.
Good.
Good.
I think I ll read a little.
Why do you say that?
I went for a walk.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don t want me to feel I m locked up in this house?
I haven t done anything, Norma.
Yes, I am, Norma.
It s yours, Joe. I gave it to you.
These are nothing. You can have anything you want if you ll only stay. What is it you want money?
You can t do this! Max! Max!... I can t face life without you, and I m not afraid to die, you know.
Oh. sure if it would make a good scene.
No, they don t.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
De Mille didn t have the heart to tell you. None of us has had the heart.
You tell her, Max. Come on, do her that favor. Tell her there isn t going to be any picture there aren t any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
Norma, grow up. You re a woman of fifty. There s nothing tragic about being fifty not unless you try to be twenty five.
Goodbye. Norma.
Madame is waiting.
Thanks. Say, she s quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
Naturally. I brought them myself.
Why are you so upset? Is there anything missing?
I m not here.
Good.
The doctor suggested it.
Madame s doctor. She has moments of melancholy. There have been some suicide attempts.
We have to be very careful. No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed room.
I wouldn t look too closely at the postmarks.
I d better press your evening clothes, sir. You have not for gotten Madame s New Year s party.
That didn t leave much for Wallace Reid.
I just found out why all those tele phone calls. It is not Miss Desmond they want. It is the car they want to rent.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio. Madame may be watching.
I m not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
It s just that I m very worried about Madame.
She never will. That is my job. It has been for a long time. You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen. I made her a star. I cannot let her be destroyed.
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D. W. Grirrith, C. B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
Is that So?
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us. That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there s going to be fireworks.
It s about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that s batting 347. The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold up. But he s trying to go straight except there s a bunch of gamblers who won t let him.
Bases Loaded. There s a 4O page outline.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don t want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Frankly, no.
You trying to be funny? because I m all out of laughs. I m over a barrel and I need a job.
Along is no good. I need it now.
Any kind of assignment. Additional Dialogue.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
No?
Don t you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach? Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo Romanoff rut, you re through.
Greatest thing that could happen to you. Now you ll have to sit behind that typewriter. Now you ll have to write.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Who?
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
Certainly it s important. It s important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally. The idea of having an assistant call me!
Say that I m busy, and hang up.
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
This is the staircase of the palace.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
It couldn t be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
What is it?
But which one?
He will be. In about five minutes.
Eliminate her.
You can do it. You re the most powerful woman on Earth.
I ve been saving it. For the right moment.
Whatever you say.
No way. I m not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
She didn t take it from you, did she?
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
I m taking you to the hospital.
I have to.
Who didn t?
You love me?
We have to have a long talk about all this.
Are you sure it s all right for us to be here?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once but we moved it to inner space.
It s not important. The important thing is I m here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who s after you.
Tell me where I can find her.
I ll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
Why not?
What s that?
No.
Of course not, but... there are things we don t understand.
It s paradise. We could be very happy here.
Just like that?
But why?
I sort of like what you said.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
It seemed that way to me.
Miss what?
I don t see why not.
Are you asking me for a " date "?
Aren t you forgetting about Selena?
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue but you better stay away from there.
What?
How do I fight it?
Hmmm?
Can you get us out? It s all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
I did.
Well, there s several ways to go.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
What s that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
A passionfruit smoothee.
What an adorable hat.
And you think you re in love.
This " love " of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
But she is real, it wasn t just a concussion.
You can t escape from me that easily. I m afraid you don t know who I am.
Don t think I m weak, just because I m a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
I don t want your help.
I could force you.
You vicious
I don t know. You seem afraid.
Well... I guess I can t.
Why George, are you proposing?
I ve got things to do.
Theories?
He s off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Oh, no thanks.
Say you think that s the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
How do you know?
Did anybody notice you?
I wish they d tell us what they re going to do with us.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you re attention.
You bet your ass.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
It s something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
Didn t you study six dimensional geometry in school?
I don t understand.
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
You re not... an orphan are you?
Oh wow, I should ve known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
But what for?
Oh, I don t know. I m not signed out for an overnight.
It doesn t seem right.
He s nice.
I have to get back. I m having dinner with the Danvers.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can t fool me.
You need me, Selena. I m the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
I have to talk to you.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Why get rid of her at al1? You ve used the Coffer of Shadow too much. It is beginning to rule your heart.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you ll both be sorry.
A cheap trick.
It s the most beautiful place in the universe.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
... but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
I know.
What? Palace? Hardly.
No, no. Not lovely. Perfect. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That s the secret of happiness.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
If there s a way in, there must be a way out.
I knew it!
Why?
Then come with me.
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges... draw with rainbows! You d have superpowers.
Don t stop. Keep moving.
Good lord, fella! I m talking about your boss.
Roebush! That s the guy! Buddy, he s gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before... Omigod!! What s tomorrow?
Sling. Singapore Sling. What s wrong?
There s no vodka in it.
Brad.
Hey! Y know what they used to call me in high school?
No, no, on the football field. They called me...... The Smallville Flash.
Brad Wilson.
Uh, no, I didn t know that, Brad.
The kid needs a man to show him
And here I am, just standing here. That s terrible. Thank you.
It sure is.
Too much mayonnaise?
I didn t
But Lana, you could
Who?
You thought that?
Hey, he ll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
But all he had was chocolate milk.
Some people don t think it s healthy.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
There s a lot of choices here.
No, thanks.
Well, this pate is rather... unusual.
Old ties are hard to cut.
Ride a thresher? Well, I don t know. Girls are trying just about everything now but
Call me.
Uh huh.
But if you wouldn t mind settling for me
Kent!
Sure.
Say!
I d better be. Suddenly I ve got competition to keep up with. Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating. Especially about the girl back home. I ll tell you what, Clark, I ll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
Mmmmm...
What are you doing?
Yeah.
Kitchen... Technician
Nope, but
Thirty five.
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain t the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Well, it was one of them little bitty two inch screen Japanese jobs.
Man, them people was crazy! How they spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? " Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce! " Ain t nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
I know, I m the fault.
Don t call me a bum! I ain t no bum!
What about this week s check?
First paycheck?
That s so you re still getting some money when you hit 65.
What m I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach? Everybody loses them fractions?
Who gets it, the company?
So where is all them half centses?
Uh... no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
Say what?
Uh...
Or socks.
Black or regular?
Which country?
Columbia.
A very wise man once said... I think it was Attila the Hun... " It s not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail. " And you are going to do it for me.
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
First question got to be " Where. "
Just the man I wanted to see!
I did. isn t it neat o?
God, that s what I keep you for.
Gus, if there s anything I hate, it s greed.
KRYPTONITE!
They ain t got captains?
Then how s all the people gonna get their oil?
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin oil. Tankers stop deliverin oil. Man, this is high stakes.
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don t you? Or would you prefer jail?
Don t be getting racist with me, man.
Fair s fair.
For what?
We ve already got some.
You designed it?
What will it do?
What will it get me?
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let s face it.
Gus, it seems we are talking state of the art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking " get down hot cha daddy o " whatever you called it.
Ain t nobody gonna mess with my machine! I ll... I ll... what will I do? I ll build in a counter punch! Anything attacks it gets counter attacked! And wiped out!
Don t make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin on.
I ain t about to argue with you. What s gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
Watch out for them air pockets!
We gonna crash?
We back in Metropolis?
I was afraid you d say that. Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
I didn t have my camera with me.
What about me?
You! You re lucky I didn t fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on the spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
I d wash that out with some iodine... Okay, Mercurochrome.
We ve already met.
But the bridge...
Listen, are you sure you shouldn t do something about the bridge?
Kent s been invited to his high school class reunion.
Hey, don t expect me to save you. Because I don t do that anymore.
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
No, I don t think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
But the other night...
Diet soda?
Hey, I know a lot of things!
Turn on the light.
Gus?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He s after our skin!
Missing????
But if somebody re programmed it, it could do much more.
Storms! Floods!
Today coffee
We already have a super tanker.
What s wrong?
Where did it come from?
A normal person.
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
So far the hostages are unharmed.
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Well, you never will again! Thanks to Vitamin C! I m reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
Of course not. Not when you ve got so much going for you.
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you. Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
Haven t you heard? There s an energy crisis. No, this was good enough for my mother
Really?
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Lois, you re amazing.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature s most awesome spectacles and the whole time you ve had your back to it. Aren t you impressed?
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Superman? Oh, was he here?
Don t fake me out, Clark. Or whoever you are.
Listen, I ve got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody s fool
Uh uh. Listen, I ll tell you what. You say I m wrong. And I say I m right. So why don t we make a little bet on it?
Lois, I...
Maybe you wanted to.
We d better talk.
Not here, Perry ll be calling at six to find out what s happening.
I don t want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
But what can you do? There s no way now...
I m sorry.
You re not selfish at all.
Everybody. Everybody else. I d be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say " Help. Come quick. Now " I know who you d have to pick.
Oh, I m not blaming you. I just know me. I d be jealous. Jealous of... of all humanity. Some rival, huh?
Please don t tell me " You ll find somebody else someday. " Cause...... well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you ll have to admit that. Oh, I ll get by, don t worry about me.
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
Lois, I really don t see why
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Uh... home...
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There s a lot of Dickens I never got around to
That s why they call em terrorists. Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of
Does she know about it? She s in it!
No offense, Kent. You re good, but Lois is the best we ve got.
What else is ballast for?
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
A bikini! I ll need to buy a new bikini, Lex. C mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven t you thought about me in a bikini..... once maybe?
You thought about me in a parka. That s sick, Lex. Really.
Look at this! Snow. Ice. Your idea of a good time.
Good. My heart can t take it.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
It s fantastic! This place is genius.
I ll be alright.
It s beautiful.
Wrong.
That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It s all white. Why doesn t the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things...
Maybe we just don t know his game plan.
Yes, but it s not all I feel.
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
Now This I want to hear.
My kind of people.
Sensible enough.
No possibility for parole?
I asked the right question.
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
I mean they can t even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
North.
To ski?
Oh! That black box in our cell?
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean what s it for?
Ahhhhhh Alpha Waves.
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don t have.
Constantly.
Certainly. But Er. Oh Magnificent one, he s just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
What do you want?
Really Lois, we ve got to stop meeting this
I must be. But I m not. Your home. This is your home.
Like it? It s magnificent! Not that it couldn t use a woman s touch. Especially around dinner time.
Oh no. I really like it sometimes. And if it weren t for him, I wouldn t have met you.
Me? I m loaded with good! I mean I ve never even used it.
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful...
Perhaps a small... incentive, your Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory...
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
I wish I knew. Oh, God.
You ll find out, General! And when you do...
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun a yellow sun the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
DELETE IN CUTTING
What shall we do now?
Yes?
I really don t think...
And I m usually in bed by ten thirty.
Gosh, I m sorry, we better get in line.
No... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville my hometown everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
What about here?
Don t tell me you re waiting for lightning to strike. Wide eyed romantics are an endangered species.
Yes, I know. I m sure it will be a great story.
I m sorry to see you go.
I m not so sure you do.
Like me?
Maybe if you d have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
I don t think we re being treated fairly, Lois. And I m going to tell Miss Warfield.
It s her father s grey matter that s weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
Everyone s saying he s... dead. But I know that isn t true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it s just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like... that.
And this so called... Nuclear Man... of yours can defeat Superman?
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Go on...
Clark Kent! You socialized with him... a... reporter!
I know Daddy. I m worried about him.
Daddy...?
I d just like to have a little less sensationalism.
An angle?
Who?
That s because there s nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I m not through insulting your father.
Right... you want to tell him how you feel...
He was getting on... and then this man with luggage and... oh, it s a long story.
A toupee that flies?
But why the hair?
Oh Leonard... When I sent the remains of my last experiment...
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He ll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He ll find his way back to me. Did you hear that?
Didn t you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
This wasn t in the plan.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
Never. But we have to hide out for a while. Lay low. Say... a couple of years. By then I ll have a new plan.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you d be far away from here by now.
Know something? You re a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet... a kitten or a puppy...
I ll ignore that... So, I created a monster who didn t work nearly as well as I might have liked you were clearly his better he needed more energy, more power.
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we ll make a fortune rearming the world.
Nobody wants war. I d just like to keep the threat alive.
Bunkers!
Nobody else.
He s thirty five years old.
Thank you.
Albert!
One of them should ve been you.
I ve been on the job.
It was hot, yes.
Lois isn t here?
What s she doing in California?
No, Mom. You know I wouldn t break my promise.
No.
Actually, she s silver haired.
I think I lost a week s salary at the dart board.
But otherwise it s swell.
Unbelievable.
He may have a gun!
You re great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you d better take over the lovelorn column.
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Huh?
Oh, not really. I guess I ll just watch a little TV and unless... would you be interested in dinner?
Oh.
No. I m just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don t mind my saying so.
Not unless you can fly.
You were probably so scared you didn t look to see what the trick was.
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn t a trick.
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
Mirrors, then. It s done with mirrors.
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
I don t know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
Jealous? Of what?
Superman. Pretty good name for him, isn t it?
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow s edition.
It isn t that I still don t like you, Clark. It s just that... well, once you ve had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl. I m going to make some coffee. You want some?
You re not the only one.
Help! I mean I can t stop saying it. Silly, isn t it There s nothing to worry about. Help! See.
Screaming
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
The way you describe him doesn t really do him justice.
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can t understand why you follow a man like that.
Me and my real estate? How many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
My father always said to me, Son, don t invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they ll always need land and for that they ll pay through the nose. Remember that, my father said. Land. "
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold Buster Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time A pity he didn t live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn t live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers? A part of that will always be with me.
Criers and complainers! That s what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
You ll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y know?
You think he s for real?
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
I read the article.
See? I see. It s you who don t see. Doesn t see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long range significance of this! Y know?
I don t mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with
I know I m going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
La de da da...
We just take it?
I don t like to talk about it, Lex.
You ever try to run in high heels? You probably did.
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in
You?! How about me?
There was a recipe on the back
Hit you? A clever girl like you? He turned slowly, slowly in the lava... was how you described it. Now that s clever. I have to hand it to you.
A night on the town instead of under it?
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it! Just look at that smog!
Your volcano chum? Your junior life saving buddy? Let s get high.
Not exactly. But it s his kind of neighborhood.
Tea?
What if he doesn t show up? What if he s taking a nap?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won t be fooled by a simple trick.
I m wearing it.
What other one?
An Ode to Spring. are there one or two " T s " in bloodletting?
Gets you where you live, huh?
What s your name, boy?
He sure as heck does that.
Folks ll ask question.
Guess I d better hitch up the rig and come back to get that... that thing he was settin in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella. Jonathan Jr. That s got a ring to it.
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don t want folks to think you re special.
As we will be.
But why Earth, Jor El. They re practically animals.
A million years behind us. Jor El, he s only a baby.
He ll be weightless.
He will be odd, different.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
Enjoyed it?
My son, I foresaw this. I knew
How good it felt!
Twenty four.
There are none of them any good anyway.
Nine to five it s a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
He is. Usually.
You ve got me? Who s got you???
Oh, God! I m going to die!
Right on the first guess.
I came to talk to you.
There s been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I m up to and all that. I d like to set the record straight. With your help.
I think you ll be able to remember it. I doubt you ll misquote me.
Who s Clark? One of your colleagues?
I d appreciate it if you didn t smoke.
Ask, You re the girl reporter.
You think they re strange?
I guess they are a little odd.
I wouldn t do that. It s against the law.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth s gravitational force.
It s not bad.
Thirty five.
195 pounds.
What about it?
Uh huh.
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Sure.
Very much.
Not there! A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
Matter? With me? Nothing s the matter.
I ll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I ll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
It is for me.
You mean bullets and fire and all that can t hurt him, but this kind of rock
Maybe it s being polished or something. Maybe they re cleaning it.
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Plenty! About The Crime of the Century, Remember?
I don t need a geography lesson, Luthor.
Of time, Luthor.
Sure. It s the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
Maybe I should get help.
You re right, you re right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...... there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
On radio waves?
They ll soon be over.
Ally. That was my nickname.
How are you?
I m fine. Still working with my father.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
I d heard that. But she s well?
Are you still in touch?
Which one?
Which clinic?
Other clinics? Oh sure. Clinics, half way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
She didn t.
That s where I m going. To see her.
I woke to the sound of Zoe s breathing. It was laboured. I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen. I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
Mitchell. It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Alison.
I will.
Mister, I don t want to know your name.
No, Mr. Ansel. I wouldn t sue you.
You can help each other. Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I m allowed to represent you together as a group.
The Walkers have agreed. The Ottos. Nicole Burnell s parents. It s important to initiate proceedings right away. Things get covered up. People lie. That s why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That s why I m out here tonight.
Why are you telling me this?
Why are you telling me this?
Hi, Mr. Ansel. Hi, Jessica, Mason...
Yeah.
Why?
Nicole, I m just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity. Don t feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
I m not sure.
Billy, please. The children.
She s resting. In her room.
It does concern me.
Why not?
Well I don t want a damned thing to do with it.
So? I mean, lot s of folks have got lawyers.
That won t happen, Billy. Mitch Stephens case is small, compared to some of those other guys. The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus. I know it s a painful thing to do, but it ll only take a few minutes of your time. That ll be the end of it.
C mon, you know that won t...
Why? You got money from Dolores insurance with the school board. We all did.
I ll help pay for Nicole, if that s what you re really talking about. I ll even give you the money I got for my kids. That s what we used to do, remember? Help each other. This was a community.
Billy, that s too early.
A while.
Tomorrow I m going to put Sean on the bus. He won t want to go. He never does. He ll cry and want to hold on to me.
It s natural.
Well, maybe that s because they know I m going to follow them. Behind the bus.
Sure.
Risa, I serviced that bus. At the garage. There s nothing wrong with it.
You believe that?
Why?
Yes.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
And they loved Bear.
For rabbits?
From what?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of? Financial pressures... run ins with the law...
You talked about it?
Berries.
Berry picking.
And what s that?
Were his parents... attentive to him?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
Did his parents attend to that?
Did they give him special care?
That would complicate things.
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty one miles an hour. Just like you ve done every morning for the past fifteen years.
Yes. He does.
I did.
What other people?
Yes.
Why would he be frightened?
Well, it s certainly what you d call interesting.
I didn t say that.
Oh, it s bizarre alright. C mon Bear. Let s get you out of here.
No. A little sugar though.
Isn t it a lovely day?
Summer s over. It s fall.
It s interesting.
Yes. It s a present.
No. From Mr. Stephens. That was him on the phone just now. He was calling to see how you were.
Did he say what about?
Was he drinking? Could you tell?
What s a ditty again?
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook s own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men s Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women s chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
Yes.
Don t you usually like to sit at the back? To wave at your Dad?
Well, if he knew magic if he could get the kids into the mountain why couldn t he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
The people in the town?
So he was mean?
Oh.
That you didn t die? Like the other children?
I won t lie.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one s to blame.
You seem very sure about that.
Yes. Dolores... and even your mom and dad. But I ll make sure you go last.
Will you be spending more than a night?
She... she was a friend of mine.
At school. She fell for Kyle just before we graduated. Got pregnant, and... went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle s dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
Wanda and Hartley. They lost Bear. He was their adopted son. A beautiful boy. Indian.
What do they do?
Crafts?
Tell me about it.
Almost three.
Perfect.
A car wash! Wow, I ve never talked to you when you ve been in a car wash. Make sure you ve got the windows closed.
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
So what s the problem?
Daddy?
I m calling because I ve got some news for you, Daddy. Some big news.
Don t you want to hear?
You always think you know what I m going to say, don t you? You always think you re two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
Okay. I went to sell blood yesterday. That s how it is. I m in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I m selling my blood.
Yes.
Yes.
I need money.
You can t ask me that! Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted. Not what I wanted it for. I want money.
You don t believe me? You don t fucking believe me?
Who are you?
You can t come here.
No.
You ve been retained?
Who did they get for that?
It s my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she d been doing for years. Besides, the school board s insurance on Dolores is minimal. A few million at the very most. The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
Excuse me?
No.
Any criminal record?
Can t get off that shitty dump they live on. What little money comes in goes to booze.
Yes.
About eight thirty in the morning.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
And where did you sit that morning?
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
You remember that much?
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods. And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual. I remember that. I m remembering it pretty clearly.
Before the actual accident?
Why were you scared?
Yes, I understand.
The speedometer. And it was downhill there.
Seventy two miles an hour.
Yes.
No.
I was scared. And there wasn t time.
No. Because the bus went off the road. And crashed.
Really?
You mean it?
You don t sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
Mrs. Ansel s clothing.
The ramp?
Very slick.
It s okay.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
What about insurance? Doesn t insurance pay for these things?
How will he do that?
Nothing.
No.
Great.
Well, okay. I ll take you about nine thirty in the morning. That s okay with you?
How about Sunday night? That s always the best time.
I don t know.
It s too late for that. She can t drive the bus anymore. The school board saw to that right off.
There s talk of that.
But Charlene...
It s compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead. Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak and suitor who?
Waiter, the check. This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
Is " he " inside?
Alone or surrounded?
Just hopping tonight. Leo Bartha been in?
Don t apologize for me, Frank!
Not that I m convinced, but you ll never prove it in a million years. Steve, you ll do what you want, but it can t hurt; he offers you an olive branch so today like olives!
See my mother?
Looka, Sidney, you re my own sister s son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Yeah, and it s the truth, to the best of my knowledge. And, frankly, I m glad. For Steve s sake, I m glad, not yours. I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart. Steve shouldn t get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
Coupla weeks. For eight weeks.
Four five nights ago. That s how I know the romance is off. Also Steve s in a very bad mood.
Call him up and ask he might drop dead with shock.
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you know who says about you know what. Right, Otis?
You ve been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that. I took her word that there was nothing to the smear. Matter of fact, I ll have my say about smears on the show today. That s why I d like YOUR personal assurance, too.
No, I wouldn t...
Why, has he bothered you before?
Son, lots of people tell me I m a gifted man, but I still can t see around corners.
Nuts! I m not here as an artist! I m here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
No punch line. Maybe I was just admiring your know how yours and Falco s.
Right now you re in no position to ask questions! And your snide remarks
You hear that, Susie... Continue please...
Those " dears " sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
I m trying to get Susie to stand up to you. But your manner is so threatening that she s afraid to speak!
No, I don t care about you you re fantastic. My whole interest, if it s not too late, is in Susie... and how to undo what you ve done to her...
Why? Because I don t like the way you toy with human lives? Your contempt and malice? Because I won t be the accomplice of your sick ego and the way it s crippled Susie...? You think of yourself you and your column you see yourself as a national glory... but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
Why?
Did Sidney tell you about it?
I wouldn t have called the boy exactly balanced...
Who said Sidney?
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
I m taking up the situation with you now...
No...
We re friends, Harvey we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don t we?
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? You gave me the item last night. Still alive?
Yeah, I got eyes. I put things together.
I have to talk to you, alone, J. J., that s why.
Can I come in for a minute?
You print them, don t you?
I didn t say that, J. J.
You want something done, J. J., but I doubt if you yourself know what s involved.
I don t?
Are you finished?
Not " we ", Sidney, you!
When?
J. J., you said you want to help me prove it!
Get Steve back his job... please...
Yes. With your " prestige " it only takes a minute ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
With a pocket fulla firecrackers good.
Can t hurt...
I like that, too. Look, J. J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps to oblivion. We re going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs... He s fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze. Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! You know, J. J. the porcupine bit needles.
Sure, he steams her up wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
Presumably yours... That s according to St. Dallas.
Integrity acute, like indigestion.
Don t go wild, Sidney.
But not for anything I did today...
She knows now.
You re incapable of the truth...
He s got them on him.
He goes out with girls.
What about?
I ve been up to here. Listen, honey, tell me something. You know Susan Hunsecker...? Has she been in? I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
You re sure. Find out for me.
Staring. Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn t surprised, but I didn t let on.
... cigarette girls... And naturally
In his apartment
I don t know it s a big apartment. But I wasn t interviewed. In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
Yeah. Otis Elwell. The columnist.
And he s a perfect stranger to me.
What sort of thing?
Next time I ll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
Nothing I didn t think of you before.
He wants me to break a leg?
It isn t. I ve just seen the early edition.
But what?
The renting agent and the tailor.
Sidney, I know you by now. Don t do a dance with me...
I m used to you...
Take a top coat.
I know you do, Sidney.
That s no way to talk...
Stay down town tonight. Maybe we ll take in a show, etc.
Why not you?
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear you or Hunsecker or both.
It is a favor, isn t it?
Temple, I caught your act the other night and
And I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
Speak to this lad, Al,... to Mr. Falco.
Not to me. Sometimes, the world feels like a cage. Then someone comes along and opens the door... and it s never Monday night again... I wish you and Steve could like each other.
Yes, but why?
I m sorry about Steve, not myself. I m even sorry for my brother. To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she s his only real family
Like you?
I m not a man, Sidney, I m
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
What do you do for that hundred a week. Fall out of bed?
He s intuitive he knows he s getting fired!
Darling, I don t care really I don t. Sidney d had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business
If the stores are open
And on Tuesday Hasenpfeffer. STEVE How do you think I realized I love you?
Why did you call me?
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there s no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
But you didn t do much about it, Susie. You walked out, and there I was... solo... and not too good at that.
But, please, Steve, please one step at a time! I was born only yesterday!...
Not what you re doing now. At least don t ask me don t ask him. You re fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
You need a break. You ll see it clear when you come back.
Miles, it s Sunday. You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
I know. You told me. It s a neural net processor. It thinks and learns like we do. It s superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison. But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, cause I feel like I m going crazy here, sometimes.
What chip?
Those lying motherfuckers!
Actually, no, she s a complete psycho. That s why she s up at Pescedero. She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
No! Don t kill him!
But it s the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
I couldn t... oh, God. You... came here... to stop me?
I love you, John. I always have.
It s John who s the target now. You have to protect him. He s wide open.
Don t quit, Sarah. Our son need you.
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
On all what?
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
That s right. I was raised very strictly. So don t speak before you are spoken to!
Respect your elders and your betters!
Eating is eating... and...
When he made his decision, he couldn t have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who ve returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
I m Steve. What s your name?
Sounds a lot of run. So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
Some.
I guess it s possible.
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
Yes.
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they ve... they ve discovered his secret archive.
I don t know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
Major Richards said he d call to let us know.
Five minutes.
Major, I don t see how this line of questioning could...
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
And totally irrelevant.
Your manner.
Yeah.
With more what? More what?
David, I don t understand a thing about you. You re a Jew. Are you a Jew?
A human being, oh, good, I m relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti Semitic remarks like you wouldn t believe. I got letters.
Colonel. Pleasure.
Not yet.
Furtw  ngler s in a different category.
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
Don t talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
What museum?
No can do.
I have a duty.
Yes.
Three months.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
No. Ours was damaged.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires. Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtw  ngler?
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
What is this, Emmi?
What s not right?
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
I ll ask the questions, Helmuth.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
That s what I asked.
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
Do you know what s in this archive?
Helmuth.
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Show you?
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
Exactly. Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one zero four nine three three one?
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That s what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That s how he made me co operate.
Major, we re discussing a man of genius, I don t want...
Yeah?
He did?
Never heard of him, who is he?
Who s he?
The Miracle Kid.
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
Yes, Dr. Furtw  ngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Yes.
I don t know what you mean, Major.
Nope.
Sure.
Right. Claims assessor.
They said I was dogged?
Like this bandleader.
First oboe.
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
He also conducted for Hitler, didn t he?
Brave? To celebrate Hitler s birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
Not really. Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
The pay s the same but you ll make more in tips.
Alright!
That guy s a jerk. I did you a favor.
You re a big help.
I hate the beige one.
Yes. Don t hurt me.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
Hey, I m not stupid, y know. They can t build anything like that yet.
One possible future. Four your point of view. I don t know the tech stuff.
I don t understand...
The what?
Freezing.
Kyle.
It s okay. Forget it.
What?
You trust him. He s got that strength. You d die in a second for John.
John never said much about him. He dies. Even before the war...
I volunteered.
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
Look, Reese, I didn t ask for this honor and I don t want it. Any of it.
Okay. Talk some more.
What about it?
Molecular memory.
Tactically dangerous. We lay low.
That s not my mission.
I was thinking, there s so much I ve got to show you when we get through this. It s mind boggling, the pos sibilities... Disneyland, the beach, movies... matinees with popcorn and foot long hot dogs...
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad, Kyle... all the things you ve never seen and done. You re here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
I want it to be over for you.
Probably. Sarah, if I get zeroed...
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything. In case they send another one.
Good fighters.
Someone?
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
It s better that way.

Then how are you supposed to get back?
Why?
Okay. Okay. But this... cyborg... if it s metal...
I m afraid that s not up to me.
I won t. Now just relax. Where are you? Yeah, I know it... on Pico. Are you alright?
Lieutenant, are you sure it s them? Maybe I should see the... bodies.
I can t sleep.
You gotta be kidding me. The new guys ll be short stroking it over this one. A one day pattern killer.
I know.
No. Keep getting an answer ing machine.
I already did. No answer at the door and the apartment manager s out. I m keeping them there.
I just called.
I can hear it now, it s gonna be the goddamned Phone Book Killer.
Projections were far too optimistic.
Our E. P. S. was one fifty last quarter. We re up eight cents per share.
Will you really hold me to it over pennies?
The stock will turn.
Because it s fair. Give me next quarter. If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
You intractable son of a bitch. If your father could see you now...
Now, look...
There is no Baer / Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
No. This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland. I thought you two should meet.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Fine, Dennis. Soon as I get my money for this week.
It was an accident.
What are you babbling about, psycho?
Don t just stand there, get help!
He s pissing his pants. Is that real enough for you? Call 911!
What is your problem?
A game?
What are you talking about?
You mean, the guy who turned blue and wet himself...?
Where are you going?
It was a gift... from my brother.
Why not?
If there was one.
You first.
You pull me up.
No.
I m not wearing underwear. Okay? There, I said it. Satisfied.
What s C. R. S.?
They ll love that.
You re a grown man. I m not responsible for you.
Your shoes cost a thousand dollars?
Nicholas. Nicholas Van Orton.
If this was my office, I wouldn t keep that closed.
I don t think I ve ever spent this much time with someone who didn t even ask my name.
Right. Call me Christy.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Seriously? What did they say?
Can we talk?
Is this you?
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine. You re saying it s not you?
Well... the red bra.
Sure. You alright? Is this still that contest you re in...
You?
What s wrong?
Wha...?
Get out.
Get out of my car!
I don t know, nobody does. I m an employee.
I know things... like who you can trust. Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
How? How could they have gotten anything?
Overseas operator? Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
It might be best if we didn t talk.
How many times have you done this? I m interested.
Scams, con games. How many?
What... what do you mean?
I m back from the dead.
Nicholas...
You tell me... I want to know who s behind this. Who did this to me... how, why...?
Who s responsible?!
... what...?
Where d you get that gun?
We searched the house.
What are you doing?
Bullshit. They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
I saw them kill him!
Stop talking to them!
Stop talking...
Shut up!
That s not true...
No...
Stop it!
I have to show you...
That s my fault. I get too worked up at these. I m very method. You do know... that s not my name.
Claire.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
What about dinner sometime, when you get back? Would that be...?
I realize. Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Like... where are you from?
Big family... small?
Studied acting, I assume?
Single?
Boyfriend?
Underwear?
Conrad, what a surprise. Gesundheit.
" Seymour Butts. " I never get tired of that one.
They ll be wanting it back.
So do you. And to think I was worried...
How long s it been? Since mom died... four years? How are you?
Elizabeth?
Too bad, I liked her. So, you re all alone in the House of Pain?
Nowhere in particular. Don t you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Yeah.
No.
" Consumer Recrreation Services. " What, do they make golf clubs?
Why?
Fun?
This isn t an escort service?
Like a stroke?
Okay.
I said I would...
Are you still on mediction?
I ll call them, okay?
I m going to call.
Okay, okay... okay? I just... you know I hate surprises.
Just drive, man. It s fucking nuts!
They re methodical. They re nothing if they re not that.
C. R. S. Who do you think? Jesus H., thank your lucky charms. To think what I almost got you into.
You dodged a bullet.
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you. And then, just when you think it s done, that s when the real fucking begins.
It doesn t stop, Nick. I paid the bill, I gave em their money, but it all started again. They won t leave me alone...
Everything. I m a goddamn human pinata...
It s a flat tire. That s all.
We re going to figure this out. Get a grip on yourself.
Really?
You re part of it...
No, it doesn t! Those keys were put there. I didn t even know...
Listen to yourself. Why would I do anything like what you re describing?
Stop this. It s not true...
Yeah.
Oh, God yes please. Thanks, man. I ll take you up on that.
Yeah, yeah. She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
Well, where to begin. It s complicated...
Robbed?
Have you gone to the police?
Yes.
What happened to you, Nick? I mean, look at yourself...
There s nothing to forgive.
You re going? Well, thanks again. Good to see you, Rachel... Thanks for coming, Mel. I ll get your car back. Right now it s, uh... at the zoo. Sorry.
I ll call. I really will.
I m not quite sure how this works. My brother...
No, thank you.
What s all this for?
No, I mean, what is it FOR? What are you selling?
A game?
What kind of vacation?
Humor me with specifics.
And if nothing s lacking?
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
Don t worry. It s been terrific spending the entire day with your " crack team ".
You mean, I don t like it, he doesn t pay?
You mean, dis satisfied.
I m tired of dealing with peons. I need to get to whoever s in charge.
How do I find them? Their offices are empty.
No, I can t. I m sorry and all, but...
What are you gonna do anyway? You won t get your money back.
I told you, they hired me over the phone. I never met anyone.
It was a different floor then...
I can t tell you how not interested I am.
Okay. I think he s into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Fine.
No, thank you. Goodnight.
Ilsa... you re alright?
Did the alarm go off? The house... they... you didn t see...?
Was he morose, or...? I mean...
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
I m just like him.
Did you worry about him?
Your brother. Will you come with me?
It s a private matter, for you... I think you ll be more comfortable...
His behavior...?
Look, where is he?!
No.
No.
Let me think... Hordes of men in tuxedos. Everyone s droning. Ludwell s trying to break the ice by reciting an off color limerick...
I wouldn t mention the following, except he was very insistent. It s obviously some sort of prank...
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
Pardon me? I m afraid I don t...
Why are you following me?
Is Alan Baer " the Game? " Is that what this is?
Greetings fellow insomniac.
What?
Uh... Nell Vance...
Well, I... uh...
Sure.
Why?
Do we still get paid for the week?
It s a question.
You could have.
You don t really believe it s haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
All night?
You want company?
And that will be a good place to end this study.
Not the way you ve constructed your group, it s just not ethical!
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
No, but she does, and that s all that matters.
No.
She needed a job, Malcolm. And she s smart. And she helps me.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
I m really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
Theo I think. You ve asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What s going on?
It was very specific.
In the bathroom in my mother s room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table. It smelled like that wood.
I wasn t thinking about my mother s bathroom.
I looked at Theo. She had a look on her face.
Yes.
I m sorry. I m messing up the study.
I don t know.
It was.
You ll never see it again. Mr. Dudley s taking care of it. I m sorry, Nell. Can I show you something you d like to see?
Why?
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
What?
How d I know it was for you?
That? That s Hill House.
I m a scientist. I just conducted an experiment. Now I have to write it up.
This? It s from a thrift shop.
Fifteen dollars.
It s all I could afford.
That s why we re here.
I m between jobs right now. My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over. So... And you?
Don t tell me Boston is different from New York.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn t. If we could all live together... but... they hate each other. It s hard to be Miss Perversity when you re the only one at the party. D you know what I mean?
A blank canvas! I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not. So, you? Husbands? Boyfriends? Girlfriends? Where do you live?
Yes. I ve missed it.
What s his first name?
Maybe you did it yourself.
There s hundreds of them. This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
I don t know what to think anymore.
Well?
I think so.
Nell, it makes sense. It all makes sense. You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
I don t think I want any.
I used to hate it. Now I like it.
I want to know why you need that scary guy in your house.
Then what good is he?
Is that a problem?
I m loyal to things that make me happy.
Well, you re certainly not a person.
No. You re not specific enough to be a person. You re more like a vibe.
It s not a knock.
It s an observation. Like: I m hungry. When are we eating?
What kind of food?
Why?
Like you.
You demand to be served. A fork fetishist.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. The sensual experience.
I m sorry.
Who?
We all did.
Nothing. I guess it s hard to pass on this road.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
We think?
Why not?
Not bad.
Where do we go?
What shit is this. I just do it. I don t prepare it.
This is un fucking professional.
Fuck you, Mr. whatever your name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
There s been some trouble downtown.
What the papers used to call a " gangland slaying. "
No, Terry. They don t work like that. Jenny Wilson s father paid a little visit, left a message.
Why, because you re my security consultant? This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
Heavier than that now. But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
And where is this guest? Don t they want to interview him.
We ll find him.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
There s already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
Let him break he likes to break.
I wouldn t talk.
England. Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
Just luck, this, really. Never been to one of these before.
Been to the Boat Show.
Yeah?
Lookin good.
What d you call that the Protector?
Eduardo. Rama.
No reason.
Huh?
Terry Valentine.
No, not my girl. Self control, she had. Point of pride. And people don t change, do they.
Y what?
This ain t your lot?
That s what I thought, man. But it was not a hotel or nothin that we went to. It was someplace else.
Did Jenny know?
Nah, coppers don t do nothing, do they.
She didn t write to me, did she.
Who d Jenny get it off of this grass or whatever?
I think you didn t get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
Nick s a nick, n it? No matter what state you re in. State of remorse, most likely for gettin caught.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin Yellow Pages?
Sod that. Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I ve skived off to.
Not me, man.
It s only insurance. Can t be too careful. This Terry Valentine, he s probably a wonderful fella. They were together how long?
Hang about. I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
And that s where you met Jenny.
How d the two of you hook up, then?
Gate s open. I had a butcher s at the house.
Butcher s hook. Look. I don t much reckon those minders of his.
He s brought in the heavy mob.
Extra muscle. Bodyguards.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
No one else is even here yet.
You goin back inside?
That would be too easy.
He s gotta know why.
Again?
What post office?
Not much you?
Uh huh.
Probably.
Really.
Well, those are the breaks.
You just cooking then?
You look alike.
Not her brand.
Wanted to talk to you, didn t I?
Been busy, have you.
It s been a while.
That s not what I heard.
I heard you were what s that adorable phrase? " at Her Majesty s pleasure. "
Sewing mailbags? Me? Never did an honest day s work in my life, dear. Wasn t about to start when I was in stir not with all that leisure time on my hands.
Hardly buried. Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Sarcastic, moi? Maybe I ll mellow when my ship comes in. It s expected any day now. I m all packed and ready to go.
If it played in England somebody owes me money. Who told you that Eddie?
Three seasons. They found that s the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail. I was wife number three the ingenue.
Now who s being sarcastic?
Not embarrassed.
She never told Eddie, though.
How d you manage that, then.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
In Jenny? Course not. How could I be. Course I wasn t.
Footloose and fancy free.
Yesterday. Afternoon.
No, I had some other matters to attend to, you know. Getting a car sorted...
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin out, you d probably have to come home first.
He give me your address.
Well, don t suppose she did, really, most of her life. On her own after her mum died. Aunts and uncles for a time and then the bright lights beckoned.
Nah, accommodation address.
Something like that, yeah.
That s what was estimated.
Now, you shouldn t run yourself down. My employer, Mr. Lindgren
Mr. Lindgren.
My employer.
Proprietor of a London firm. Of longstanding.
Based in London, but with international concerns.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
Anyhow, he s always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son cause there ll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
This and that. Y know. Ways and means.
Why not.
What d you want me to do. Stay at home, twiddlin me thumbs. Doing sweet F. A.  Fuck All .
What do you think.
Depends, don it.
I ll bloody well ask him.
She told you all about my details but not about his. Lovely.
You think Terry gave me access to her things? Probably sold her clothes.
Early 70 s. I was away. Maidstone. Possibly Brixton.
You don t know how I ve compromised my standards.
It s too involved; a lifetime of non involvement. Anywhere else I d be an interesting little number, here I m just SAG number forty eight thousand and one. SAG meaning Screen Actor s Guild.
Still, there have been rewards. It s sunny. And some of the producers who call even have credits.
A jeweller s up the West End. We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work. Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed after we d made the grab, n all. Would you Adam n Eve it.
We were lucky to be nicked. Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren t discovered till the Monday. Good job we were still breathing.
Hey?
I ll tell ya something: it made me a model prisoner. Put me right off any escape attempts. Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience? Not bloody likely.
Did you. What was that in aid of?
Get seven years, did you?
Just now? Overnight?
It s true. Has to be said. I got off to a slow start.
Honest. Didn t know where to look till I was 21.
You ever been to London?
I ve ardly ever left it.
I ve got the hang of the driving. Found this place all right.
What about your grandmother?
He alive to see this?
What d your father do?
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Good luck to him. He couldn t find his prick if he didn t wear Y fronts.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don t miss a trick.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost. Coming back to haunt her.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
Up the coast.
I don t know few hours, I guess.
I could use a vacation. Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this is a vacation.
What s in Big Sur?
How do you know?
You can t count on very many people, that s the trouble. Number of times a decent job s been cocked up...
Look, mush, you re the guv nor here, I can see that, I m on your manor now, right. So there s no need to get out of your pram. I m Johnny come lately to all this. Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it s got nothing to do with me. I don t wanna know.
I can well believe it. I m sure he has done, son. He s about as straight as a dog s hind leg.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate. I m here on another matter entirely.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would ve been me for the high jump.
Yeah. Shouldn t wonder. Must ve done.
Nothing financial. Strictly personal. I can see how all this import export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I m concerned. A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
Eh?
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
All of what?
Oh, yeah, right. The deal.
As you prefer, squire. As you prefer.
And that is?
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday s events.
Deals? My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You d have to be more specific.
My client is an entrepreneur. I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
He s always been very forward thinking. He invested wisely.
Ian?
Sorry. Wasn t me.
Unless I m not who I think I am.
Yeah?
No kidding.
Right. Chain of respect. That s good, that.
Yeah. Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
Nine years? Is that legal?
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
Sounds like you need a rest.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
Good luck.
Very attractive. Good idea. Now I really want to fuck you.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don t put a bullet through their fuckin skulls, doesn t it.
Why don t they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you d be interested in watching. Y know. Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING. Or BIG FAT GUY. SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS. Wouldn t that be good?
What are you doing here?
Since when?
I don t want you here, Terry.
You know his name is Frank.
You know I don t live with him.
Are you finished?
Who s looking for you?
Have we met? There s something I can t quite
Ah.
I don t.
I suppose that s good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Tell me.
Yes. Thank you.
Yes, Ann?
At night, there were lights we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told  me . No one else.
The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it the knowledge a threat. They try to limit it, and
I m so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Who?
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Hello, Birdy.
We ve certainly missed you.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
Boy.
Oh, Mr Crane
Geez, Mr Crane, I don t know. I hadn t really thought about a career or stuff.
Geez, Mr Crane.
He didn t say that.
Look, I m no expert, but
I m sure there s a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
... Uh huh.
Ah... it s nothing.
Huh.
Birdy
Uh
That right.
Huh.
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
I can get it, yeah.
No. I tell me
What s involved, aside from putting up the money? What re you looking for the partner to do?
And how do we share
I ll have it in a week.
Maybe.
Way out of line.
Cash.
Sure.
Yeah.
It s OK.
That ll be fine.
 Screw  you Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is  dry  cleaning, this is not some fly by night thing here! I must say, I ve been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I ve never
And I ve never been asked Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You
Mm.
How s business, Dave?
All right, I guess.
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Hell, I, I m not proud of it. But, uh, that s not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Well, you know what that would do to me.
Awkward?! Ann d throw me out on my keister! Hell, it s her family s store  her  store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
I only work here! And the lady s husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
 10, 000! I don t know what to do, Ed. I don t know what I  can  do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It s, uh, it s no one you know. It s a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
Well, I guess he don t care that it s obvious.
... Why don t you just pay him, Dave?
Mm.
But it s...
I m at Nirdlinger s. Let yourself in.
... Huh?
Big Dave
I, uh...
Honey?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger s I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Nah, go ahead. I m not big on parties.
Who?
How s that?
So?
Congratulations, Gina.
Honey...
You don t have to
Honey...
Oh, hell. Drink?
Sure you don t need one?
OK. Boy. Jesus!
He a good man?
So
I m fine. Thanks.
Uh huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Uh huh. He s the, uh...
Yeah.
Haven t I seen you up in ladies wear?
Uh huh. Some beat, huh?
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Uh huh.
Huh?
Yeah.
Uh huh.
Uh huh.
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah.
Whuddya mean?
Yeah lucky for us, huh, pal?
What the
OK.
... Nah.
Yeah.
Frank, uh, you know I ll try to contribute, but, uh Freddy Riedenschneider
That s very generous.
Uh huh.
Uh huh.
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
What d he say?
Crane. Ed Crane.
Yeah
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
We re just closing, friend.
Could you come with me please?
Ah.
Not an owner.
Homicide.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you re conscious is he conscious?
Uh... you re under arrest.
You ll go to the prison hospital.
It better be good.
It s too late now. Guests are arriving. The Mayor s car is pulling up.
You haven t got the authority. Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan. Move.
Where s the walk in safe?
What s the combination?
Hurry up!
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it s fifteen... it s been a while...
The cops are non negotiable, Ippolito. Why don t you just tell me how this space station works.
That s great if you re stopping a burglar. Not our goal here. Are there motion detectors?
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people. You d be violating every fire regulation on the books. We ll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells. One more question. I see a big hole. If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
What doors?
Where the hell are you?
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
What is it?
Got my hands full here.
Dr. John Whittlesley.
I don t believe it.
We can t do without you. You re one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology. You re practically an institution around here.
Let me help. I can take care of everything.
How can you say that? You know it s not true.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
Your work is highly relevant. What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology? Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
I m not giving up.
You are this museum. It won t be the same without you.
A blow dart. Seed pods. A plant press. Pretty unimpressive stuff.
I m not sure. As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct. This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
What are they?
Let s not jump to conclusions. This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
That s not so unusual. Many plants carry viruses. Like the burls on Maple trees.
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
Margo, what you ve just described is a killing machine.
Some kind of power failure. Maybe it s the storm. Do you have a flashlight?
We can t. We ve managed to get inside the one place that s safe. I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements. If we go outside, we re risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there s nothing we can do. The building must be swarming with police by now. It won t take long for them to get through the doors.
We will.
Yes, I do.
I m an Evolutionary Biologist. What do you do?
Evolutionary Biologist. I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
She s never going to take us to see the dinosaurs. That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
What is it?
Big as a house.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard s.
Margo, you haven t heard?
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand? Impossible. The sample must be contaminated.
So what?
Eats them?
How about lunch?
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
Fiji.
I m sorry, er... the biggest one.
One.
Today.
A month.
You are a travel agent, aren t you? " Doris "? Your job is to help people travel.
Why wouldn t I?
That s right.
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
What s to see?
All prop cars accounted for?
What have we missed?
Why would we
What music?
A show that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
Truman, I ve watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss. I know you better than you know yourself. You re not going to walk out that door
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn t erase the memory.
Because his mother got sick very sick. He couldn t leave her. He s a kind boy, maybe too kind.
It s not gonna be his, you idiot.
You think she d go through with it?
Oh, yes.
That s right. Lauren.
I m sorry. It s not up to me.
No? Really? Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza. How about Friday?
Now.
Yeah? Outta what?
So when are you leaving?
Nursery?
Yeah, what happened?
You think so?
Sure. It s halogen. Shame it didn t hit you you could ve sued. You coming for a drink?
Sorry, I m way behind.
Are you okay? You look like shit.
Mixed up? Mixed up in what?
No. Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
Your Dad?!
Who?
How about them?
I told you I can t.
This is where it started.
Things. Things that doesn t fit. Maybe I m being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon? Like your whole life has been building to something?
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
Yeah...
Just between you and me, Marlon, I m going away for a while.
It s a lot of world for one man. You sure that s not wishful thinking, you wishing you d made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn t sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on " Seahaven Tonight "? Who hasn t wanted to be somebody?
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head?
What s that?
I won t be late.
I ve been thinking
I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
We could bum around the world for a year on that.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
I thought we were going to try for a baby. Isn t that enough of an adventure?
Fixing the mower. I saw my father today.
How do you know?
I made macaroni.
Good night, Mother.
I m sorry, I m late.
Oh, my God!
I don t know
I won t be here Sunday.
Are you listening to a word I m saying?
You hate gambling.
So why do you want to go?
You blaming me for the traffic?
I ve changed my mind again. What s New Orleans like this time of year? Mardi Gras. Or let s just see where the road takes us.
There s been an accident, Truman.
I ve got my Seahaven Bankcard.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can t stand me.
What the hell are you talking about?!
You re having a nervous breakdown, that s what s happening.
You re the one talking to the walls!
Well, I made it through another night.
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man. And you know what else was really strange? A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
They never found Dad s body maybe somehow
I m telling you, if it wasn t him, it was his twin. Did Dad have a brother?
Hold on a minute, dear. Here s us at Mount Rushmore. You remember, Truman when Dad was still with us that was quite a drive. You slept all the way there.
I m afraid that s impossible she s in pre op.
I ll try.
When you get to Fiji?
Leak at the plant. They had to shut her down.
The whole area s being evacuated.
Who?
There s no one here.
How do you know about that?
Were you there how do you know?
I don t understand.
Not bad. I just won the State Lottery.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn t want meatball today?
We don t even know you.
Yup.
Does what?
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
I apologize for making you wait I ve brought some new evidence with me
Yes.
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn t have to be explained
Working with?
Well... where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can t very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you ve made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
You got some kind of business with him?
What s that?
I know the name. Why?
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you d be needing a little drinky tonight.
I m a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB GYN.
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
S. A. C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
What s the question nobody s asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
Before the bomb went off?
Michaud was a patriot. The men he s loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn t predict.
Not according to the men in blue.
They want to discredit you for what?
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn t know why.
Dr. Kurtzweil, I m not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don t believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government
How?
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U. S. several years ago.
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
What killed them I won t even write about. I tell you, they d do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
What killed those men can t be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can t even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They ve been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
I m not sure. A virus
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
Yeah, well I don t have them all.
I ve been using you?!
I told you he and I were old friends
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
Where are you, Scully?
Did you find something?
What s wrong, Scully?
You re looking for a bomb.
I think they have that covered.
How s that?
No you didn t.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Scully, I found the bomb.
All I told them was the truth.
They have divided us, Mulder. They re splitting us up.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
They re not doing this, Mulder. I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn t turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I m sure I could rise, it just doesn t hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I ve seen and done.
No.
I was until about an hour ago.
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
Get dressed, Scully.
According to this tag.
You re telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn t die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
I d been told as much.
I don t know. But I have a hunch what you re going to find here isn t anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
I can t really talk right now.
Evidence of a massive infection.
I don t know.
Mulder
I ve got a hearing tomorrow
I wasn t planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
Something I couldn t show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I d just as soon avoid right now. The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I ve never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
All the equipment is brand new.
I don t know, Mulder.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
I ve got to be in Washington D. C. in eleven hours for a hearing the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
Of what exactly?!
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks they don t haul viruses in tanker trucks.
What do you mean by haul? What are you not telling me here?
Mulder
I don t believe this. I don t fucking believe this. Y know, I ve been here... I ve been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
Very weird.
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
Yeah...?
You can t quit, Scully.
We re close to something here we re on the verge
After what you saw last night after all you ve seen you can t just walk away
Just like that
I need you on this, Scully
I think you re in anaphylactic shock
Where are we?
About what?
And they want to blame us?
But it s not the lives we saved. It s the lives we didn t.
If they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn t deserve this.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S. A. C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
Whoever they are this goes right back to Dallas it goes right back to the bombing
How deep does this go?
A pocketful of rye...
Almost. Mocky Lock showed up.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
Why not? Just once. A trial run. What harm could it do?
I ve heard this argument before. It s not happening.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him. Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
Yes, but, you re a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
And he might blame you for terrifying him. That one moment could erase all you ve accomplished. And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
No.
Yes mother.
I ve got to feed my cat. Besides, I want to get to bed early.
A pocketful of fucking rye. What s wrong?
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
I ll be fine.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
What s wrong?
I don t need them anymore...
Thanks Miriam. Say hi to Henry and...
Really? I don t work with violent cases, I work with children. But even a kid lies. They love it when they get you to believe something that isn t true. Don t you think Stargher would do the same?
I realize that...
You don t know the procedure.
Do you think that s funny?
It doesn t have much to do with science.
The soul. The spirit. Whatever you want to call it.
Peter, okay?
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don t share.
What did you see?
You re the shrink, you tell me.
I did, yeah.
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don t think she matters anymore. Not to him. He never finished her. The others... he was able to make them his.
He might tell me about Julia. The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse. Who wants to be redeemed.
Not Stargher, not really. He s split himself right down the middle. Good / evil, right / wrong, merciful / cruel. A monster. And an innocent child. If I could reach the boy.
Don t you feel there are different sides to every personality? Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act. We re all human.
Then what is he?
If you believe that.
What difference does it make...?
You re sure of that?
Little boy?! That s him!
Yep. Eloped.
I told you. You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
It doesn t matter...
No problem.
Mocky Lock.
" Mocky Lock is the bogeyman. Mocky Lock wants me where I am. "
I need you to find something in the basement...
Delano?
You re kidding me.
What s wrong?
Prevacid. For my stomach.
No.
No.
I am. I m a pretty boring guy.
Dr. Kent.
Thanks you. Six weeks off does a body good. I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
Awaiting his arrival.
Now?
Let s give old Carl a call. Tell him he s got company.
What else do we do?!
I don t have to.
Tell you what. If this thing burns us, I take that heat. I give you permission to point your finger at me and say " It was all his idea. "
Next time, tell me, okay?
I saw her. Julia. Alive. I saw everything.
Ja, ja, ja.
Give her some cigarettes.
Sit down.
Do you understand German?
I m so sorry, I didn t notice much.
He has a little dog.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
Yes.
He was Harry s driver?
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
They re forged.
Sssh. Don t. Don t, please.
In German?
What s that?
Tell me more.
It s just what he used to say.
If we have to see the Porter we d better go.
I thought you wanted...
We re both in it, Harry.
I m so sorry.
What s the matter?
What are you going to do?
A parrot... Let it go.
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
I knew him for twenty years at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
I shall be all right.
He s safe in the Russian zone.
Oh, the usual things...
His.
Why are you lying?
Of course.
Thank you.
They re Harry s.
You won t learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
No.
No.
Where s Harry?
I m sorry I don t seem able to understand anything you say. He s alive now this minute he s doing something.
I don t know.
They ll be returned, miss.
I don t want it.
Well, I ll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Austrians aren t allowed in your hotel. Couldn t we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Just around the corner.
Yes, of course.
Martins.
Yes.
Could you buy me one. I haven t got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
When did you see him last?
Holly Martins.
I can t say that I have.
What?
What are you trying to say?
Ever seen one?
Getting around, Martins.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I ll get the next plane.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
Bring him in.
Well?...
I see.
No.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Which side of the road?
How about the doorway?
We ll never get him in the Russian zone.
Of course.
All right, Calloway. You win.
I said you win.
Well, there s not much time.
Please hurry up just get him on the telephone.
I ll look it up for you.
I know a very good dentist.
No, a major, were you really?
Goodness, that s awkward.
What about?
What is it, Sergeant?
Who?
Never heard of him.
Well, well, they seem to ve been giving you quite some busy time.
Yes.
She s been arrested.
You can help her.
And Anna...
You can get somebody else...
Why not?
You ve got plenty of contacts.
As long as they can use you?
Don t try to be a policeman, old man.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint you know a safe way out...
Coffee.
What s the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something well discreditable to Harry?
The Roumanian?
Vinkel.
Coming to the point, please.
Hear the details.
In great pain?
Mr. Lime yes.
Und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
You saw it?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Er, alive? He couldn t have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Yes.
Yes.
You don t mean that doctor?
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Now, hold on.
Funny?
He didn t want to get involved.
Joseph Harbin.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
With him. Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Okay.
Yes?
Richard. Hi.
Help you out?
I m sorry, I don t think so.
I m really sorry but I just arrived; I m on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can t afford it.
Yeah, that s right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Look I don t care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet
Traveler.
I don t think so.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Nice work.
One or two kilometers.
Why?
So?
So how many miles do you think it is?
We re ok.
What!
I don t know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Yes.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
I m sorry.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
It s on an island that no one get to.
Two.
Not too bad.
We swim.
No.
Incredible.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It s an urban myth.
So?
I rest my case. He s a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
The Zionists aren t Nazis.
They don t have extermination camps.
They sound like you.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
What??
That s a movie, you moron.
Who the fuck are you?
Yes.
Yeah. He s a respected scholar. Even No am Chomsky says he
I don t, but...
Fire...
How come you don t know it? How can you say you hate the Jews when you don t know anything about
Why the fuck not?
I have a job.
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that
People still need values, beliefs....
I don t care about money.
You re a Jew. Maybe you don t realize it, but you are.
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
Disease? What disease?
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork lift.
" And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms... "
They re my father s. He s from Argentina. My mother s family went there during the war. That s where they met.
He s in a mental institution.... He s been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
I guess. His parents are. He doesn t care about that.
Oh, really?
Why won t you talk to me?
That was a later invention, it s not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
No.
What do you care?
Oh, yeah...
What s it mean?
Why?
Hebrew s very difficult. It would take years.
Why not?
That s stupid.
What assholes.
Good question. Both. Aleph...
It s silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
They don t put them in the Torah. I ll get you a chumash, they ll have them there... Bet... Gimel... Dalid... Hay... How come you re here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
Even though his dick is so big?
V asitem...
No difference.
Nothing but nothingness... Judaism s not about belief.
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
No. Nothing follows. You don t do it because it s smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You re not saved. Nobody s saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
Don t curse in front of it.
You shouldn t.
I told you, I m good at this.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
' Cause he wasn t a rabbi.
Okay... Why don t we light candles on Friday? Let s light candles.... And say the kaddish.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
Shit... Did you talk to your mother today?
Nothing. Why are you doing this? I thought God didn t exist.
And be crushed.
You gotta get out of here.
What d you say?
Obviously.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
I d say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
How would you kill him?
They re liars and cowards.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
A week or so. There s something I want to do here first.
That doesn t seem to be happening, does it?
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what s this about? Is this about me?
What about Curtis Zampf?
I agree.
In the movement the racialist movement we believe there s a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you re recording it?
What should I be, a white inferior ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
German. Mine, too. So who do you think s given more to the world, the Germans Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
A poison...?
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
What??!?
What s that go to do with... I ve gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
Notice? Like what...?
I don t know. Is that right?
Everybody likes to, don t they?
Why?
Female...
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
So, fine, it s not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It s that they re sexually corrupt.
He has Israel.
Of course they re Jews.
Are all Jews the same?
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
So you re saying it s not true.
Do you know who you re fucking with here?
Listen to me....
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It s all narrative to them, it s... Are you going to print what this guy said?
It s slander. It s reckless disregard. I ll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
What were you, following me?
I don t. Look, stay out of what you don t understand.
You work for the New York Times. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
Yeah, and what are you? A Times man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
To hear them read Torah.
That doesn t mean I don t like hearing it.
I can t help what I think.
How did you...?
You mean the Times guy?
A forty five.
You re lying.
But I wasn t.
I can t say that.
The truth doesn t mean anything to you, does it?
Daniel Balint.
It s German.
From the Rhineland originally.
Curtis is afraid you ll marginalize us.
So what Jew would you kill first?
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Fine.
Lina... It s happening. Tonight.
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
Then he couldn t be bitter about living alone.
They re not my people....
Oh, he decides? Hitler s the chief rabbi now?...
What kids?...
Nobody ever beat me up. Look, Linda, there re fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there d be another fifty you didn t know.
I ve got to get back to the
Daniel Balint? My name s Guy Danielsen. I m a reporter with the New York Times.
Who told you that?
A Jewish prayer.
You could do it.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
I ve gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I m serious. I m always talking about it. This time it s gotta happen.
Keep driving. Don t slow down.
You said they didn t have night guards.
Who even knew?
Why? Why would she?
Where?
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won t get this many of them in here for another year. It ll be fine.
Seven thirty tomorrow evening.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What s going on?
JTS...?
I m in a kind of... underground... thing.
Why me?
I can tell....
I m a bad shot. I don t think I can
I didn t. I told you, I can t
" Do chickens give milk? "
Dennis Leary.
Funny?
And that s when the Mets started to stink.
Linda says you re not supposed to have dairy.
Eat shit....
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
Yes. Not like Enzo.
Yes.
No.
But your man isn t quite a God!
Yes... Could you please give this to Enzo.
Not yet... I m waiting for the right moment.
What kind?
Sorry. Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little. What did you say?
Like a popsicle. They re keeping him on a stick until spring.
What d you mean?
The documents are forged.
Yes! The notary is a phony. He has the same signature as the contractor!
We have to send somebody over there immediately! If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We ll be off the hook. There s a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
I tried him, he can t go. His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I ll go, boss.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium. Well, we weren t being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I m glad I did it, but I m sorry about the policy and I ll be happy to make up the money the company didn t get... of course just now I don t have... One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars. But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we d be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave? I m pregnant.
No. He s French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
Hello!
Yes.
In a lake.
Congratulations.
No.
Yes, of course, I ll do the Hula!
Have you known him long?
What was he like, when he was little?
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
No.
... That s what he s here for, isn t he?
Congratulations, Enzo.
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Sinister is what I d call it...! Ours is so much cheerful! Why don t you come and stay with me... There s plenty of room in my suite.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
What are you doing here?
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
Damn it! Why won t you give me a straight answer, for once?!
I won t, I swear.
No. Jacques is a creature of the sea. He isn t meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
You really think so? Did you tell him you were pregnant?
Don t.
Because he won t understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake. And he s only waiting for one thing: that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
Have the car painted.
Then tell him to wax it too.
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
You shouldn t even carry cigarettes on board!
The rules are the rules.
Noireuter.
It s nothing. It s just the helium, because of the air pressure.
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
No...
Yes, I know.
Great!
Because I m sure you re dying to beat me.
No. All you need is to want to be the best.
What room have you got?
You don t have a room? Paolo? What did I just hear? I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world! And you re throwing him out! Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
How do you make a living? Your experiments, does it pay well?
Exactly, I mean, after all, we re men!
People say that?
Not at all!
What?
I m a little tired, I don t know if...
Ah ha. You finally want to know about women.
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
Everything about what?
As I said, second of all you re too skinny. You ve got tiny lungs. I still don t understand how you can dive without getting sick.
You don t need a stretcher to take her with you. You know that, don t you?
What is it?
Yes.
No. Thank you. It s really beautiful.
I don t want to erase anything.
... Yes.
I ve had many... when the sea doesn t want you.
You say that because you have the title!
... I was right about what?
I can t.
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
Yes, thank you. Intravenous if possible.
Who?
We saw each other a little while ago.
I thought it was a nice place. Isn t it?
I don t know... why?
I guess... But you know... I m American and I ve mostly been taught to be competitive... There s always pleasure of being the best?
Thank you...
Lucky I was there to save you.
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
Well, water isn t exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
I m glad you stayed. Thank you.
How do you know that?
I did?
Why?
I m not from the sea... I don t understand what you re talking about.
I got fired.
I m still here.
... It s hard you know. You re so far away and I don t know what else to say.
No... tell me.
... Not at all.
Absolutely positive.
Uncle Louis. He s a 75 year old amazing guy, isn t he?
I didn t dive.
It s nothing. Just the long trip. I m a little jet lagged.
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
That s good... that s wonderful. It s wonderful for you.
Anything.
Again?
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
You called the police?
What?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!... I guess.
Way past it.
No. I m just depressed.
I know, I know! I m a terrible person... It s... I m so damn, damn sad.
Do you think I should have stayed? Don t you think maybe I should have stayed? I ve been a jerk, right? I should have stayed! I was supposed to be in love... I was in love! I am in love, why did I act like a bitch? He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy. It was too good to be true.
They re paramedics. They wait at 180 feet.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet. They dive with a Helium oxygen mixture. At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
That isn t for the divers actually. It s for the balloon. It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator. Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
I ll have to talk to the driver.
But... how is he going to breathe?
How long can he stay down? Without breathing?
Why is he doing this?
Okay, okay. You ll have it by the end of the week, how s that?
I got the job done didn t I? I did what I had to do.
What s your first move?
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok s The Chosen?
Well, then I ve got good news for you. We just got word that he ll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I m sending Esther to meet you there at once.
What s up?
Take Esther with you, you ll need the backup.
It s Esther. Santa s got her.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
Please, call me Mordechai.
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man s a demon. There s no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
Yes Esther.
Keep going.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn t let you do this alone.
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
I m back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
Oh. It means that Santa s gonna fuck Hanukkah s shit up.
Okay, look. I m going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I m already tense as it is.
A stereo type alarm system?
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won t get hurt.
No, it was the perfect level.
No. I m airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
I can t understand that fancy talk. You mean I m a gold digger? Sure, I m a gold digger why not?
Good looking?
What about me?
You know not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
I drink.
I sleep it off.
I don t know.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I ll fix everything. You don t want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
You really think so, Charlie?
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
I d like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I d like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
What do you want to see him for?
Look, Charlie, you didn t do it, and you know you didn t.
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past
They re fools. Why don t they let Charlie How Come hunt it alone. He s an Indian.
You ll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Who?
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father s grave...
Rosita   I have wondered 
She s a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
You think be s pretty nice, don t you?
You re lucky. I wish he d front page for me.
Hey   I m over here.
Good evening.
It s to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won t ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths   that s what this procession is supposed to be.
You re worrying about its killing someone else?
Of course. It s the way any decent man would feel in your position.
That s right, of course.
Yes?
Sure certainly  but what s that got to do with this?
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That s why it kills human beings.
It doesn t know how to hunt its natural prey.
More or less.
About Charlie s leopard?
I can understand what you mean demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
A hunch that s all I ve got about this leopard thing. It s just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
I don t know.
Don t you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
I don t mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
Couldn t you tell a man like that when you saw him?
No.
Not! I tell you. No!
I didn t do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
It s better you don t know.
I couldn t rest  I couldn t sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado s body broken mangled. I saw it day and night. It was waiting everywhere I turned.
Well, I m hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter  whoever she was. In fact, I m not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry s little publicity stunt with the leopard.
I m sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
I thought they came right past here  
Go on foot.
Something s wrong with this whole setup
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Why?
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
Kiki he won t hurt you. There s nothing to be afraid of.
Listen, Kicks, you ll never guess what I ve cooked up this tine...
I thought is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight   walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She s going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
And I never will you know what s between us  we re a thing But this is serious competition.
Kiki he won t hurt you. There s nothing to be afraid of.
Listen, Kicks, you ll never guess what I ve cooked up this time.
I thought  is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She s going to make an entrance this town will never forget.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
Almost three years, isn t it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
And I never will you know what s between us  we re a thing But this is serious big competition.
I don t know   a witness. He seemed to know something about animals you know expert testimony.
Yeah.
The whole town s in a state, Kiki   doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep   nobody on the streets at night  
I know. Funerals.
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
You re positive of that, aren t you?
Didn t you take your cut out of the closing check?
What! You can t be
Eloise doesn t own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo Clo s family.
I know Teresa 
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, " don t be soft? "
Must it?
Ain  t nobody out there, Mister.
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
Will you please come with me?
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes  majordomo. They are expecting you.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
When will they be back?
I work here, sir. I  m here most of the time.
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir. Would you like a drink while you wait?
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
And that is the last time any...
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps it wasn  t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
I  m afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brother  s in trouble.
I don  t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Disney! How inter...
You... You found that at Leon  s?
What... What are you talking about?
Excuse me?
Where is it? He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Oh no. You  ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Excuse me?
Perhaps I should come back when you  re...
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well connected people as you hire a small time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
You watched the tape? Friedman and his people don  t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They  re in the import export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
Have you got a pen?
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L. A. code...
Yes... You woke me up... It  s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
Paul Lamont...?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
You  re repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
Aren  t you curious to know about Friedman?
Sorry?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
You  re mad...
Why... I don  t know what you  re talking about.
Have you finished?
You knew he had nothing to do with your brother  s disappearance, didn  t you?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well being...
My brother hung himself.
Leon hung himself.
Leon hung himself...
Leon hung himself...
... You you spoke to him?
If if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don  t you accuse me of killing my brother?
Leon could still have hung himself.
You don  t say.
I didn  t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just... Do you think we spoke about it? I  ve known for five years. He  s known I  ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn  t speak about...
Think what you like. But don  t presume to understand.
Good.
Why do I feel I needn  t answer that?
You bastard...
You splendid bastard...
... We  re turning in circles.
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
I didn  t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Something like that.
Something like that.
Here we go again.
Simplify and damn.
Should I?
You seem to know what you  re talking about.
My husband didn  t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
I didn  t intend it that way... It just happened. He heard from Laurence that you  d been back. That we  d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn  t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
What are you doing? You can  t. I...
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
Get to the point, will you...
On... Once... Once... What are we... you going to do?
I don  t know. Everyone  s dead...
Europe... France. I  m French but I live in London...... England.
Well, I  d sooner mug an old lady...
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
Lombard... It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I  d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
I know where to look.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
I  m sure I  ll find a way.
How come you  re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do. What am I really looking at here, huh? Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
A criminal?
Thank you. But I think I  ll go to bed. It  s been a long day.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
So who... Who  s the man? Where is he?
Italian? The Mafia...?
We  re both thinking the same thing, right?
That that won  t do. That  s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that  s the way...
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I  ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it  ll be too late.
What about your friendly cop?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
Emily...
Have we done business before?
May I have your phone number?
What sort have you got?
Yeah.
Yes... Good, good...
What about an untrained pup, white...
Tomorrow?
I see. How much?
... Fine. I  ll go for the safe place.
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
Where is he?
... On holiday?
No... No... I swear...
Yeah... The Diplomat.
What?
Finsbury Park. We  re in Finsbury Park.
What kids?
I don  t know... This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I don  t know where the kids are... I work for Martin, that  s all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
The company. We all work for the company.
I don  t know. I don  t know, man. I don  t even know Friedman that well... I... Man, you  ve got to get me out of here...
Just me... Martin  s gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He  s got a safe... I need a doctor...
B Black...
How are you, Jane?
No.
Good.
La what?
Should I?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many.
It  s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Well, I hope you  re not too heartbroken and...
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, tr  s bien, merci. Dites moi, pourriez vous me dire si vous avez recommand  mes services  quelqu  un r  cemment... Vous  tes certain... Non, non... Je vous remercie...
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I  d given you and then got back, remember? I can  t find it. Do you know where it is?
It  s not.
Your secretary, huh!
Really? And how are you, eh? Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
Yes. How did...
I hope it  s not too significant.
Recommended?
Didn  t you say I came recommended? That  s what I thought. May I know by whom?
Okay. Recommended...
Look Mrs Spitz... I don  t know to whom I  m indebted for the recommendation but... I  m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
You wouldn  t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Do what, Mr Lombard?
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
No. And before you ask, no, he  s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about. His address is in this envelope with Leonard  s address, keys and other things you might need.
My rates...
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Anything at all?
Is my money in there?
I don  t know what your problem is, but...
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Huh. I  d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the client  le. Get rid of them and we  re out of business.
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who can  t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Huh... I  m sure there  d be lots of takers.
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
You  re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guy  s not one of Friedman  s...
I told you... The rabble, it  s me... Huh... It  s sad.
Hyatt... Friedman  s... at the Hyatt...
Have you?
An Austrian.
I  ll be alone.
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Oh. This is... We  d arranged to meet tonight and I  m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Where  s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Shut up! Where  s your wallet?
Should I be?
Can I get up now?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leon  s not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
Haven  t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I  d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Did Leon tell you why he didn  t want the police involved, Rhian?
Good reasons?
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
I  m afraid I don  t understand.
Do you know Leon  s parents names?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
I  m sorry. It  s just you don  t look local...
The nineteenth... How come you didn  t know?
Er... Yes...
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
... No.
How  s the boy doing?
Excuse me?
Uh huh.
I take it you don  t know where he is, then?
I know his work better than I know him.
What about his girlfriend?
Small, blond, good looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Would you know where I might reach her?
Could that be Camden Market?
Cinq cents.
O  est pass  ton salon?
Alors quoi?
A l  achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais  a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C  est pas vraiment mon truc. I don  t know any Austrian, Xavier.
Then why don  t you reach him?
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn  t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what  s your business with these Spitzes?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as  Never Forget . Over the years we  re talking about a dozen or so execution type killings.
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I  d watch my step. These people are well connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady  s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
That s a good idea, sire.
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
Majesty, I can t...
Of course I am, it s just that...
Very generous of you all. How much?
We have to do something before she tries it again! I beg of you, my lord, don t let her down... let me organize an escape...
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
Now?
Now?
This I can do. I was studying at the University of Paris till the English invaded it.
Yes, I am. I m an archer who can read and write. Who do you want to write to?
Jeanne, calm down. You can t blame the people they ve been hearing all about you for weeks.
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Jeanne, you ve been badly wounded...
Well...
Yes...
Yes. Yes, I m fine... We need more brushwood! Why are you staring at me like that?
What... what do you mean?
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it s a sign to go home?
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite love your enemy, kill your enemy what is good, what is evil...?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
You make it sound so simple...
Me?! It s not me, it s God who makes everything complicated! If he s all powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place? And why let this war go on for a hundred years? And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family? Why, why?!
Tell me...
He said that... he s making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
Did your voices tell you that? You told me you hadn t heard them for months...
Or maybe it s Jeanne who s in a trap her own trap a downward spiral that she can t stop?
I would like to marry you. But I have already promised myself... to God.
But it is what I want.
But... why... what s the point?
I want to stay with you...
Just give me a moment and then you ll be free...
I I don t understand...
I m staying, Jean.
I m not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
Good.
Sound the retreat...
I made no such promise. Sound the retreat for the night!
You re afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
Good advice for the French, not for the English! Do you think God hates the English?
I tried to.
I don t remember. Maybe.
I don t know...
No... I said " Surrender in the name of the King of France "...
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission! Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
Quite a few.
Yes...
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
No, it s just... a sword is a weapon.
And so I... I prefer my banner.
To avoid killing anyone.
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
And when was that?
Thirty years ago? I m not surprised it s gone...
What are you doing? This is an ecclesiastical court you have no right to do this!
To hell with procedure! We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not is that clear?
We want her burned as a witch!
How can I calm down when I m made the laughing stock of the whole court?! I ve had enough!
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
Scared of a girl?
I m on the side of our Mother Holy Church. Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
Am I... am I dead?
Where... where am I?
Your king? Ah yes, of course... What s he going to pay me with? Cows? Chickens? I prefer gold, and the English have plenty. I wonder how much they ll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can t accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil s work.
No no, I m fine, really...
What about you?
But where are you going to be?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
Your trial, Jeanne. On a charge of heresy.
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
In a village called Domremy.
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Yes. In the church at Domremy.
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
Not long ago...
Praying.
Yes.
Many things...
Yes...
And may I go to Mass?
And you? Why did you lie? You promised I could be confessed...
He s feeling wonderful.
And your Duke? The Duke of Bedford?
Buying her?
You think?
W w what has that got to do with this Maiden?
You really think she s been sent... by God?
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war. For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
But... her army s so small now...
I m... I m not the king...
You did well...
... You look wonderful...
Now hold on you re not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
Gave you? Well now, I wouldn t quite put it like that...
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done. Now it s time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English. You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, " to everything there is a season: a time for war, and a time for peace "...
She says she ll be here tomorrow...!
What difference does it make where she comes from?
I can see her if I want to. I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p p propitious Leo, with Virgo rising. Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
There s no time, sire we can t hold up the ceremony... there s no telling when the English might come back... they re only ten leagues away...
If there was, I didn t see it...
His face.
Yes.
I m more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
Go on to the next question.
That s not a lot.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
Yes... they were.
Everywhere. Where is the food?
I know...
For what?
Because if they don t, I ll raise such a war cry against them that they will remember us forever!
You may have been with your counsel, but I ve been with mine, and I m telling you, God s counsel is wiser than yours, and he s telling me to speak to the English now!
Jeanne, with respect we can t just attack the Tourelles like that it s a very complicated matter and...
Jeanne, you have to understand it s not easy for us I mean for our pride to suddenly be usurped by a well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment how would you feel, if you were me?
Can we uh discuss this later?
The wind will be against us...
We need another ten minutes...
Not yet.
Damn right!
Yes. We can pray.
But the bridge has been pulled down!
No... not like this...
I know, but so is the enemy they re falling back Paris is ours...!
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Jeanne, look behind you.
Of course I do? Bring them up!
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
But my voices... they promised me...
I had been sold to the English. I d rather die than fall into their hands.
No...
No...!
That s now what I meant...
I know, but that s not the way things happened...
Yes, but...
No!
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
Why not? He has good teeth...
Hey, my friend! I m glad to see your ugly damn face again!
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
What s the use? The drawbridge is up!
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm! I love it!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
YOU THINK GOD ISN T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
I might ask you the same question.
And what exactly is it that you can t take anymore of?
You ll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry? Why not face up to your lies? It s your lies you can t stand anymore...
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn t need to run away from yourself like this...
I don t know I don t care anymore I just want to be at peace!
I don t understand. What do you want from me?
What are you doing here? Please... leave... you can t stay here...
Yes!
They re going to come and visit you in here?
I want to see that. Do you mind if I stay... on the side? I won t bother you.
Why not?
What do you mean, they won t come?
Because! Because I ve always been faithful to God, and I ve followed everything he said... and I ve done everything he asked me...
Yes... lots of things!
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
But... it didn t just get there by itself.
So your memory s coming back?
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
In His name??
I... I was defending myself as best I could! Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don t they? Or should I have let myself be killed?
No, I do not think so. I don t think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
Why are you doing this to me?? Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
What are you doing on the wall?
What for?
Do you think this cross will protect you?
I don t think so.
Yes... of course... when you don t need me anymore.
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
Yes, my lord.
I need to confess.
I need to confess again.
There s no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Whose were they?
I m sure he ll forgive you.
Jeanne if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we d spend our whole life in church.
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
And your mother everything s fine with her?
Yes, it is.
I feel safe here. And it s where I can talk to him.
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he s the one who does the talking.
He never says his name.
Why did she have to die?
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can t I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
Then what will? And what will bring her back? And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me? Why didn t he take my life instead of hers? It was my fault I was late she gave me her hiding place...!!
Jeanne, be patient.
Soon you ll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
A singer. Her husband s an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I d like to talk to her.
You can t, it s too dangerous.
Dorota, don t be ridiculous, he s a pediatrician.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
My name s Dorota, I m Jurek s sister. oh! You re bleeding.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Wladek, please.
I didn t want to come, I didn t want to see all this, but I couldn t stop myself.
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they ll let him out. This is disgraceful.
That s what I said, it s so it s too absurd!
Dorota.
I m sorry I was given this address. I m looking for a Mr a Mr Dzikiewicz.
He ll be back before curfew.
Oh my God, it s terrible, you ve got to do something, oh my God!
What?
What?
I haven t seen him.
Tough luck.
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
It costs.
Then there s nothing I can do. He should ve joined us when I gave him the chance..
Who told you?
Who s recruiting?
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
Yes, please.
What d you mean, take the table away?
That makes a change.
We use what?
Of course they ll notice it. But look This is a good place for something.
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
Well, you know what s funny? You re funny with that ridiculous tie.
I didn t grovel, I asked him to help.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
They were taking you away.
You re mad, that s your trouble, you re mad.
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
Should never have come out. I should ve stayed there, fought with them.
Yes, so did the Germans.
Yes, but what good did it do?
You re amazing, Jehuda.
So, what s the news?
I don t know why I come here every evening, it s always such bad news.
You re an artist, Wladek, you keep people s spirits up. You do enough.
You ve heard the rumours they re going to resettle us in the East?
I ve been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I ve managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I ve been trying all the firms, the shops...
I didn t know you were in the certificate business.
Can you help? I ve no money...
Wladek! How are you?
Fine, we re fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you ve called about. There s nothing we can do; they won t reopen the station
... not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I m sure you ll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
It s easy to get out, it s how you survive on the other side that s hard.
You made contact?
It s a little cut, nothing.
Where are we going?
Pack, Wladek, there s no time.
No, I don t think so?
Sorry, I don t remember.
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
Someone died here. It s tapu.
On your property?
I d like to make a swap.
The piano.
Yes, I thought that.
I ll have to get lessons. It wouldn t be much use without them.
I don t want to learn.
No.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don t want it.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
You mean in signs?
Spoken words?
I d rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
He chopped it off
She says, throw the piano overboard.
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn t want it. She says it s spoiled
It s my mother s piano.
She says it s her piano, and she won t have him touch it. He s an oaf, he can t read, he s ignorant.
You ve missed this bit.
Do I know any gigs?
That s right.
Joliet badge, Snyder. Don t cut much up here.
Don t think so. I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
What s the line on Visitation?
You just sit tight, old man. We re gonna have to get you to a doctor. I ll call a cop.
Naw, it s okay.
Thanks. I m obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin.
I gotta! Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin out on em. They gave me to 4: 00 to come up with the cash. I don t get it there I m dead.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
He won t know you re carryin it. C mon, you gotta help me out.
How bout you? I ll give you the whole hundred!
What do we do?
No.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
Good, have em down at Stenner s old Pool Hall before 3: 00. We re gonna run through the route tonight.
I had some appointments.
All of it.
I checked the place out. There weren t no dicks in there.
What s eatin you? I ve blown money before.
You think my play is bad?
What?
What are you talkin about? We just took off the biggest score we ve ever had. We can do anything we want now.
Hey look. You think I m gonna run out on ya or somethin? Just cause we hit it big. Luther, I owe you everything. If you hadn t taught me con, I wouldn t know nothin.
But you played the Big Con. You said it was nothin. A game for flakes and mama s boys.
You ll take a cut of what I make, won t ya?
If that s the way you want it.
Salino? Why waste our best people on a small time job like this? It ain t no heavy gee we re after. The guy s a five and dime grifter.
They didn t think he d be so cagey, that s all. They ll get him next time.
He s not comin in. Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning. The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good. Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Hell yes. He does this every year. There s nothing to worry about.
Believe me, the Man s gonna be real happy. Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side. How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I ve got to compete with that?
You the Duff that didn t come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
He was a con man, wasn t he?
Which way did he do, Eirie?
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do. He knew he was holdin ya back.
You ain t gonna have nothin if you don t lay off them games of chance. There s a depression on ya know.
If you saved a little, you wouldn t have to grift so much.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
Aw Christ, it doesn t make no difference now. If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first... Damn, there s no answer at Luther s.
I m busy, Floyd.
Which one?
They workin for anybody?
What about the other one?
Who s got the contract?
Hackers.
Yes sir.
You ve only been playin three hours, Doyle.
What do ya want the others to get?
I don t know. This is kinda short notice. I m not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
All we need is the bookie setup for now. We ll worry about the telegraph office later.
C mon, you can do better than that. We ain t no heel grifters.
Does J. J. know how to use this thing?
You sober?
He had you down as a big timer. What happened?
You mean you blew it.
He didn t tell me you was a fuck up, either. You played the Big Con since then.
I picked something up on the way.
I don t know. Haven t seen anybody.
You didn t act much like you wanted to learn it.
You know anything about him?
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain t a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
Why?
We ll get by without em.
I never played for winos.
You re sacred of em, aren t ya?
Then you ll do it?
What do ya mean?
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
He threatened to kill me.
Did he say he wouldn t?
Nothin. I told ya everything there is.
It was too noisy.
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we ll get Lonnegan down and stomp on em.
A couple days; that s all I m askin. I can stay clear that long.
Just a little nervous, that s all.
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
Then why you doin it?
Yeh.
You were right, Henry. It s not enough... But it s close.
Wonder why he doesn t fly both ways.
The wire is ten years outa date.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
Yeh, I think so. I gave the kay ducer a C note. You find out the deck?
See ya and raise three.
The name is Lonnegan.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room. She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
You scored blood money today, Hooker. You need a friend.
You re crazy. I m not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
I ll square it with the fixer.
What for? I haven t done anything.
But I got a train to make.
But what about all these other people?
All right, I ll give ya a break. Down that hall there, there s an unmarked door on the left. Go on in there and wait at the window. I ll take this...... in the back and run it through right away. We ll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
Where s June today?
Where you goin?
2: 00 A. M.
No. What s wrong with the front?
No.
What the hell for?
You move right along, don t ya.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
All right, when?
What the hell s the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin.
Naw, just a little hard times, that s all. It s all over now.
I feel lucky tonight.
Yeh, he knows that.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
Then why the rat?
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar. Can t see him till morning anyway.
I need somebody respectable... but not completely legit. What I m gonna do isn t very legal.
That s worth fifteen grand to ya?
660 Marshall Street. Tomorrow at 12: 30, if you re interested.
I was afraid you weren t gonna come. We haven t got much time.
Sometime after 1: 00 a guy s gonna call here and give you the name of a horse. All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw s place and bet it on that pony. There s nothin to it, but don t take too much time. We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
This is just a test. The big one comes later. Be careful with that though, it s all I got.
You re a lucky man, all right.
Why don t ya then.
I m in.
Not yet, but... Hey, there s only a grand here.
What is this? That s my money. You tryin to muscle me?
Let me talk to him.
I didn t get the bet down in time.
How am I gonna do that?
No.
Don t think I know him.
I ll make parole.
Hell yes. We don t care about the mark. He deserves what he gets.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we ll shoot you down on sight.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
I need more proof, that s all. Anybody can get lucky once.
If it works again tomorrow, I ll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day. We split 60 40.
We missed him.
There wasn t any way he coulda known we was in there. We made a clean pick on the lock and didn t leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
I don t know. He took it hard.
For fifteen years.
Only rents by the month. Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Yeh, but I don t know where he is.
Sure. Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
Why don t you pick him up yourself?
Wouldn t that be too bad. You d hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
He ll never do it.
Wel l l, it seems he has a secretary.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Don t start worrying about him. He s a good guy, but screwy.
Said he stole his invention.
Nothing.
Another young man.
That is, if it s all right with you.
Don t cry.
Darling, you can t go through any more of this. Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we ll go out to my family s in the country.
You ve got to get your mind off this.
Go!
What are you talking about?
Do you think I care
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and
Dorothy!
You re talking like a crazy person,
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you. Don t you understand that? I love you.
You re high enough.
Give it to me.
He s all right. Isn t that enough?
You just want money and you haven t any right to any more. He made a big settlement on you.
I didn t say I would. But we ve got to have money.
I didn t.
It s a piece of evidence that s worth a great deal more than that.
I ll do nothing of the sort.
I don t think you will. It s your father s.
He s waiting for you.
He wouldn t say.
Of course we do! We ve been friends for years.
Yes.
Yes.
Was fascinated with you.... a real live detective.... You used to tell me the most wonderful stories. Were they true?
Yes. Some nut who wanted to kill him. How is your father?
Macaulay.
Tried him once
We re at the Normandie for a couple of weeks. Why don t you drop around?
Yes.
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Where did you hit her?
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
Did she make any sound? Didn t scream?
Which way did she fall?
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Forgive me. How are you?
You see how much we have to say.
Yes, she would.
What would your mother say to that?
Wouldn t it be a little embarrassing... all of us there... your other and me and your stepfather?
Where are you going?
A new invention?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
It s a promise?
You know how it is, Dad. He s sort of under Mother s thumb.
And he still wants to marry me!
Only in bad weather.
Better get home before it is.
He said that father s in town. He s been seeing Julia right along.
Not a thing.
Gilbert!
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren t there!
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we ll stick around in case the old man himself shows up. Then we seen him...... sneak in and we decide to come up. And pretty lucky for you.
What s he want of you?
What s that to you?
What d he think it was to you?
I m asking you.
No.
No.
I ll have to try to remember.
You mean about that gun?
Oh, that s a phoney. The men didn t even have to go down.
Nothing yet to cinch it.
What do you mean?
Who s your candidate?
They re all O. K. Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
Oh, he s all right. We know all about him. He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
No.
I think we re on the right track.
I m calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Lucky thing for us they weren t in that lime.
Rosebreen.
I never saw him. I don t think anyone saw him.
Yes. But we figured it was just blackmail...
No.
Yesterday. I gave her a thousand dollars.
Oh, then you did hear from him?
Well, what?
He did!
When was that?
Did you go?
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
I see.
Why yes.
No.
I don t think so. Of course I was terribly upset... I hardly knew what I was doing.
Goodbye.
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
They ll be here. Don t worry. My men are picking them up.
What s the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn t have so much trouble with this one.
Want to take a poke at him?
You don t think I had anything to do with it?
How d you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
How can I help but mind? I m constantly humiliated... just because I haven t money.
You ve said that for weeks.
Why don t you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
All right. All right.
Just what I said I d do.
Wouldn t I. Just watch me.
I thought you said you weren t going there.
He s not anybody. Just a fellow I used to know.
This is the first time I ve seen him in years. I didn t want him to think I was high hatting him.
Don t worry. You won t see him again. What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
What bonds?
Oh yes. Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
Don t you remember....
Do you realize that you re accusing me of....
What if I did take them? I m sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
Go ahead!
Hello.... give me.... Well....?
You re going to return every cent of it!
What did you do with the rest?
Good morning. I m afraid this isn t a very " Merry Christmas " for you.
I do wish you d tell me where you re going.
But suppose some business comes up...
Never mind.
I trust you.
No.
What ll I do if something comes up?
Is Julia going with you?
Hello, Macaulay. Come in.
Mimi?... Oh, Dorothy s mother. Does she have to be up to something?
I haven t been a detective for four years.
My wife s father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things. And I m looking after them.
What s all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
No word at all?
How do you do? What did you say?.... He is?.... Where is he? Very well. He s back in town.... Wynant. Thank heaven. He s waiting for me now. Forgive me, Mrs. Charles... but I ve been so upset. It s no joke working for a man like that. I must be off. Goodbye.... Goodbye,
I hate to bother you when you re laid up.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
Hello.... oh, just a minute. Police department?
Hello, Mimi.
What do you think?
Well, don t you?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York. Hire one of them.
I tell you again, I don t want any part of it. Now you take Dorothy home and...
They ll want more than your word for that.
Last night. He came to see me at my apartment.
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
You re lying, Mimi. But then, you d do anything for money. You re getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won t get anything if he s dead.
I didn t knock Julia off.
I haven t seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
I wouldn t have any reason to hurt her. She was always on the up and up with me. But that dirty little Nunheim he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn t, so he put the finger on me.
Listen. " Studsy " Burke told me you used to be O. K. That s why I m here. Do they....
He s all right. He d like to see you. But listen... What s the law doing to me? Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
That d be very smart. That d be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain s been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument. The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions. They d like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you re on the level. Be on the level.
She don t say she is, but I figure she is
Once I wanted five grand Cash
Hello, baby.
I had him out this morning.
He s well trained. He ll behave himself.
If you like em like that.
Only you, darling... lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
I was hoping I wouldn t have to tell you. Dorothy is really my daughter. You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young. I didn t know what I was doing. We were all like that on my father s side.
Much better, thanks.
Six Martinis.
I haven t the time. I m much too busy seeing that you don t lose any of the money I married you for.
What are you drinking?
She brought it in. Trying to make me believe she did it.
Yes.
That s jolly.
Can t you get to sleep?
Maybe a drink would help you.
They were kidding you.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police ll catch him without my help.
Breakfast.
Someone get a doctor.
Well, quick get into bed. Are you all right?
Want a drink?
He s got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you re not on this case.
No. It s a Christmas present.
You did.
Who s that?
I m stifling, but it s so pretty. The Kirbys.
Yes.
Let s see. Where s it from?
I don t know.
Your guess is as good as mine.
It s not going to hurt me to get up.
You talk as if I were Asta.
What s the matter with you?
Maybe I will.
I don t believe he did it.
No reason. Just a hunch. But I m going to find out. I m tired of being pushed around.
I m going to take Asta for a walk.
Looks like a hold up!
I ve got hunch. I m going down to look at Wynant s shop, I want to find out why it s closed.
He went away lots of times when I knew him but he never closed his shop. I ve got a hunch something is up.
I don t know... This thing has got my goat. I ve got to find out.
Say you re the one who got me in this!
I ll be all right. I ve got Asta to protect me.
You wouldn t be a widow long.
Not with all your money!
Goodbye, darling.
Sure I will.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
My soul, woman. I give you three murders and you aren t satisfied.
I did find him!
He was down in the shop.
It was his body that was buried there.
That s a fact.
Yup. Don t you want something to eat?
That s what they think... Guild and all of them. They take it for granted that it s just another of Wynant s victims. Guild s hot footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That s all that troubles him.
Several things. Hello, Fred. We re hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions. Oh, and coffee.
Huh?
Oh. Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed. The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Couple of months anyway.
Smart gal.
Hey... hey. Don t do that.
I can t help it. I can t tell a soul. I didn t even tell Guild.
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope. I don t want to go off half cocked.
I m going to get the real murderer. I ve got an idea. Want to see me take him?
Got a nice evening dress?
Got a nice evening dress?
I m going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Oh, they ll come. I ll have Guild issue the invitations.
Mimi...
Yes.
I don t know.
It s the only way it makes sense.
No, Mr. Charles.
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
Yes, sir. Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
That time you sent me up last... I learned book keeping at Sing Sing. I figured it might be an in for me somewhere s.
Honest, Mr, Charles. I never touched that safe. Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
Mr. Charles she did that s why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles I did do a little chiseling. I come to bring it back and fix up the books. I didn t want him to find out and come after me
Yes. Nick!
Yes.
I m going to give her a wedding present. Thought I d better do it now, before I forget it. I can drop them on my way to... That s funny.... Where are those bonds?
I know I left them there.
Maybe she has.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Home!
I m fired.
Baghdad.
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Please, I beg of you. The American army is there. I am Iraqi. They will kill me.
Damn, this is sweet. We are going to be home in no time.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you re going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
Wha...
We shouldn t have been here, Epps. There is a war going on!
Deserters would have run, they wouldn t have engaged.
Not much chance of that. Jaeger s an idiot.
He s an idiot, and he s not nearly as hard as he thinks.
I don t know, and I wasn t about to mess with it.
For climbing.
You just go when I say go.
We can t just go off and
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that s about it.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here. Worn down to nothing now.
What do you figure it to be?
I don t know. There s a lot of space up here. They could be just about
What am I supposed to do?
What about the gold?
Maybe we should split it up now.
You ve had your say, Wes. Now leave it.
Maybe I do.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn t sleeping. Would have slit our throats if I hadn t stopped him.
How s he going to want the gold? He couldn t even know we had it.
You said he was a deserter.
You don t know that.
He s an enemy soldier.
I ve got no stomach for murder.
It s murder, and I won t be any part of it.
No.
I out rank you, that s why.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Suppose I don t go for that?
What about Jaeger?
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
I have to answer him.
What are you doing?
Knock it off!
Ready for what? What are you supposed to be doing?
Blow me.
There might be something in there.
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
Everybody s got a job to do. Figure it this way: At least you get to go home alive.
Just listen to me! I ve been doing some reading. In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks. It became part of the Ottoman empire. When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff. Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards. They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes. I read about this, man. I read about it.
We disappear for awhile. We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
Yeah. I meant... You know what I m going to do with it? I m going to buy a Sixty three Vette Stingray. All tricked out and cherry. I m going to be so sweet.
What are you going to do with your third?
Oh, that s fun.
And I m talking about enjoying myself.
Wh what do you think
We ve got to do something. We ve got to turn around.
We run they ll shoot us anyway. If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis. Or even if they know we re Americans they might get scared, think we re part of a detachment and keep on going.
Yeah. Yeah, she s fine.
I m just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we re doing. I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
... I know.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Don t drink up all of yours, cause you aren t getting any of ours.
I heard it click.
Just be cool.
Just relax.
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
We re going to be right over here.
It s not falling asleep. You ve only been standing there for three minutes.
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
Wes is right. If there were any more mines we would have found them. Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
It s a fire fight.
Something like that.
Stay low.
We re not going to do anything.
What does it look like I m doing?
I m not. And I m not doing anything, because there s nothing down here.
We ve been digging. We ve been digging for hours. If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
Is it dead?
I wouldn t know. I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
We send the gold up what s to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
Jesus, Jaeger.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line. It didn t seem that long.
Northeast? That s away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
It should, or it will? Least going back the way we came we know what we re up against.
We ll find our way.
Forget Wes.
Wes is dead!
What do you mean no? They can fly us home.
We ll lie.
I m not like Wes. Wes was crazy.
I don t want it this way. I wouldn t kill you just to kill you, but I can t let you lose the gold for me. Not when we re so close.
Yeah. Well, me too.
Sure.
You still got a map on you?
Yeah.
Makes two of us.
It s all right. I don t like it, but it s over now.
It s a desert. That s what deserts do at night; they get cold.
No!
We ve got to keep moving while there s still light.
Don t you touch it.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Place all alone like that? Must be a boarder check point.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
I don t know. Something Wes had taught me. I think it means " Don t shoot. We re your friends. "
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them. They couldn t tell in the dark.
And then what?
I... I never killed anyone before. I told you that.
I just said I would. I don t think I
Shi ites, I think.
I don t know. They killed Wes.
I don t know!
With what? Against how many?
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
The... the gold...
When did you make the switch?
But...
What if it hadn t been Wes? What if... I mean, accidently, what if I had...
A car s got to come along sooner or later. When it does, we jack it.
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you re hurt. When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Somebody has to.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Threatened to blow my brains out?
What?
Thought you were going to buy a car.
I don t know.
What?
Really?
Hey, Jaeger. What s up.
Just... want to be ready when we do.
They re all good ones. Satellites we ve got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam s ass.
A headache?
I m making you uncomfortable. Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three hundred thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn t bother you. But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
I don t think we ll go to war. We shouldn t even be here. This isn t our fight, it s a regional conflict. It should be decided regionally.
I m saying don t do it accidently.
It was an accident. You saw it was an accident.
Don t shoot me, I m friendly. You can use that when you surrender.
Now you need me.
Yeah, you re funny.
Naw, nothing.
I ll show Epps. He ll be sorry when I get this thing open.
What?
Yeah. So?
Like I said; so?
What s your point, Wes? You have a point?
It doesn t mean anything.
What!?
Come on, man. I almost had this thing open.
This is so weird. It s happening, but it s not. It s like a TV show, and we re part of it.
What?
It s right here. This region; an Nagaf. I got recon photos. There re no troops there, no fighting
It s about a hundred miles from where we are now. How long do you think it would take us to
It s real. I m telling you, it s real.
You know it s real. You know it s real, and you know it s there. You know it.
If! If there s a treasure.
I don t know. It would be small, easy to transport and hide. Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
Oh, God!
Oh, Jesus!
I think I m going to throw up. I am. I m going to toss.
Yeah, well, we re not.
We re not going anywhere. Not til we get what we came for.
Then lets go back while we still can.
You have to go with us, Wes.
Until we re out of the mine field is how long.
That don t mean nothing. Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we re in the clear.
Funny you should say that while we re out looking for gold.
Yeah, we re down.
All last night he could have been
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Cortex bonding.... possible temporary. Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
Correct. Origin?
Triple three, triple three! easy.....
Permant cortex bond.
What happened?
4732...?
Vocasity
You ve seen enough.
I have to see SEN. I ve just been given a shift change.
Now.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
Don t go.
You don t have to... I don t trust him. You ought to file a report.
Look, dirt!
That s not food. Can t be food.
What?
It s 3  27 hundred
No! Don t go.
Don t take anything.
No.... I though I m afraid.
What?
You don t know. You don t....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
They don t know.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes. They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX s chest.
I m not afraid... I m not afraid.
We re leaving.
We re leaving.
THX and me.
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
What?
Where is LUH?
Why are you so concerned?
I want you for my roommate.
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch. She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You re upsetting yourself. Would you like something?
You know I have a way with the computers. I can clear myself for any area..... almost.
Listen to me.... You have no need to distrust me. We re going....
When?..... How?
I was lost.
What?
What are you talking about. How do you know? I need her! I need her. She needs me. I ve got to get to her.
We ll never make it through that mainway... I wonder what happened to SEN. I m crazy! This whole thing is crazy... What am I doing? My mind is full of so many things I can t think of anything, anymore. Who are you?
What kind of answer is that?
You have to!.... I m 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence: Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5. Roommate 3417 LU... H.
Must be an expressway.... You don t have to stay here, you know....
Soon he ll be a plastic cube.
No...... She s dead THX........
Where s LUH?
What do you want?
My mate has been acting very strange. I can t explain it..... but. I haven t been feeling very well myself. I don t know, maybe it s me. I needed an SP9 last night. I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
Yes...
Yes...
I m looking for the Bomb Squad.
Where are they?
Officer Reilly, vice.
Where?
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name s Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
When you need us, you love us, when you don t, we re shunned by the rest of the department.
This isn t bumper cars, it s brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
So you re the " Device Squad "... and you defuse " devices "?
Anything else I should know?
She s not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you ve seen one of these devices before?
Hey, look
Oh yeah? Prove it.
I don t know. You tell me?
You mentioned something called Redstone.
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
Except they ll blow you up if you don t play along.
Yep.
Look, it s a longshot...
What not bad. You ve got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
We ve gotta be. In this business, you don t exactly make alot of outside commitments.
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
What?
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Your partner?
Where you guys at?
Catch that alert? That s him in the U Haul.
Cuz he got the girl, now he s leaving town.
Would you?
Off the scale.
Nothing.
That s the blasting cap good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
Too easy. There s gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
I don t know.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
It s from an IRA.
" Punks ", huh?
Who is he?
Thank you.
Alex
Stay here.
Look who s talking, old man.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don t work. Maybe they ll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin me about taking them camping.
One of these days you re gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you ll wish you had family.
What are you talking about, it s purring like a kitty.
She didn t work out, had to cut her loose.
Don t talk.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn t you call for back up?
Goddamit, Reilly
I know you re anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide s way or I ll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
Report on the case so far.
Yes, sir.
She s refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
My God, you re going to use her, aren t you?
I promised her she d be safe.
It won t work, he ll know it s a trap...
I know.
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
So you lost a handbag, madame?
And it had diamonds in the back.
And diamonds in the front.
Diamonds all over.
Yes, M sieu Laval?
Tell M sieu Giron I can t see him now. Impossible! And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going.
No!
About tonsils.
I m sorry, but I don t seem to recall the occasion. No, I m afraid...
Goodbye, M sieu Filiba.
No.
No... Have you ever been in Vienna?
Amsterdam?
Constantinople?
You ve never been in Constantinople?
But you have been in Venice?
Let me tell you, Venice can t compare with Constantinople.
I don t care what you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas
Umm.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
The type they marry.
Nice suit.
Smart. London, eh?
Just dull.
Funny the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Oh, yes... Well, that s not so easy. Beginnings are always difficult.
If Casanova suddenly... turned out to be Romeo... having supper with Juliet who might become Cleopatra... How would you start?
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron. Moon in champagne.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron?
No, Baron! I beg your pardon.
But please, Baron. We re not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won t tell anybody I told you?
Um hum...
I hope so, too.
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Examination! M sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame s confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
Um hum!
No, not at all!
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
I don t see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
I ve got to see you.
Right now! It s very important, M sieu Laval.
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
Otherwise I ll call the police
What is it?
What do you mean?
I know it!
M sieu...
M sieu Monescu!
Just as you say, Doctor.
Good day, Doctor.
Now just a minute, Major
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don t think he saw me. I m positive he didn t. Thank heaven!... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded. Baron, I shouldn t have come!
No no.
I would like to.
Why should you?
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
Someone from another world so entirely different. One gets so tired of one s own class princes and counts and dukes and kings ah! And everybody talking shop always trying to sell jewelry... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
Please. When I came here it was for a little adventure a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me and it isn t the champagne. The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I ve got a confession to make to you. Baron, you are a crook. You robbed the gentleman in two fifty three, five, seven, and nine. May I have the salt?
Thank you.
No, thank you.
Not at all, Countess... There s one very good stone in it.
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out with the Bank of Constantinople?
Gaston Monescu.
Last year? It can t be that long.
And take the twenty thousand francs...
Sweetheart, what day is today?
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow
We ll take the Royal Suite!
Seven and nine!
And her jewelry is worth a fortune!
What?
Ah!
Certainly!
Beautiful. And what of it? Let me tell you something: so far as I m concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Oh, no, darling. There s more sex appeal coming on the first of the month. It s only ten days... Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Yes Filiba! Venice Grand Hotel room two fifty three
He recognized you!
Spanish passports?
At twelve twenty. I know. Lyons two, four, seven, one. Two more days and we d have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Hello... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Do  a Ignacio Fernandez. My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon...? Thank you, thank you. How long will it take you?
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
Grossartig kolossal!
Am Berliner Zug.
What time is your rendezvous?
Yes, M sieu Colet?
That s what I m here for to get out! I want to get away from here, from you as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me. Sixty five, ninety four
Thirty five to the left sixty three, eight... I wouldn t fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth... Seventy six, eighty four, fifty five What has she got that I haven t got?
Shut up! Don t make up any stories!
Lily
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I know that niche.
I remember.
Not particularly.
I don t know how I could have lost it there. I was nowhere near that niche.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Well I am Madame Colet.
But really, m sieu, this isn t necessary.
Oh! You didn t read it!
Oh!
M sieu Laval!
What s wrong now?
Too much blue in crimson.
No, no, no! I disagree with you completely! I tried it once
Peaches and cream.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
Don t be embarrassed, madame. I ll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash... To make a long story short a member of the nouveaux poor.
What?
Yes!
Right!
It is beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
This used to be my secretary s room.
Too happy. That s why I discharged her.
You think that s too much?
Then I mislay my checkbook
And how I handle my money!
Tell me, M sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Ye es?
What would you do if you were my secretary?
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M sieu Giron?
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M sieu Laval?
Um hum...
Um hum...
Together.
How do you like my dress?
Hair?
Correct! Good night.
Good night.
Talk? About me about us?
Afraid I m ruining your reputation, M sieu Laval?
You would?
Like that?
I know all your tricks.
So you think you can get me?
You re conceited
Now, let me tell you
I must go.
I know it.
I believe you.
On the night table.
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
Call the police?
Um hum...
Thank you. Seventy six, eighty
Yes, Gaston?
Adolph?
And you expect me to believe that?
I don t believe it!
Giron...!
Goodbye.
Divine...
But it could have been glorious.
Divine... But that terrible policeman!
I m sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to to
I know!
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M sieu Giron.
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early. My little brother goes to school You see, Mother is dead.
Please! Thank you.
You see Oh, not a word to M sieu Laval!
Potatoes. He doesn t want me to eat them and naturally I don t want to upset him.
Well uh yes and no.
Nervous? Um hum. He smokes too much!
So he wouldn t be confined so much to his office
For all the really important things
I ll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found...
He started it.
That s true.
Because I hate him because I love you!
Yes, my bag!
Apparently not. Don t you know where it is?
But you saw it here.
That s right.
The pumps
The ship will sink.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman s passage, then make a right.
Stay off the floor. Don t stir it up like you did yesterday.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
A hundred and one next month.
Don t drop it Rose.
Don t you mean work me?
I m not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
That s the shape my hand s gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I m not leaving here without it.
Bobby, we re launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
Rose Calvert.
We re running out of time. And this strutting martinet...... isn t letting any men in at all.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren t forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
I couldn t let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It s bad luck.
You re wrong. They re fascinating. Like in a dream... there s truth without logic. What s his name again...? Picasso.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
I was tired.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
What do I tell your mother?
Sure. Count me in.
I ll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
Almost as good as you.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa n culo testa di cazzo
Bollocks.
They re a bloody sight warmer than we are.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
No, but we re making excellent time.
I prefer not to push the engines until they ve been properly run in.
We ve struck ice.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I ll let go.
What do you mean no I won t? Don t presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don t know me.
I can t. I m involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
No.
I know what ice fishing is!
You re crazy.
Could I speak to you in private?
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Jack.
Well, here you are.
You re welcome. Rose.
That s not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
Uh huh. They ll be sorry. Course you ll be dead.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Is he your boyfriend?
Yes, exactly!
If only it were that simple.
Oh, Jack... please don t judge me until you ve seen my world.
Just some sketches.
She had beautiful hands.
No, no! Just with her hands.
You wouldn t last two days. There s no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
I m sorry. Really... I am.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That s a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Alright, we re going. We ll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we ll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side saddle stuff.
Sure. If you like.
A mistake?
I did, didn t I? Look! A shooting star.
Jack, I
I don t think so. They ve got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you re goin to die if you don t break out. Maybe not right away, cause you re strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin to go out.
You re right. Only you can do that.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
He s an ex Pinkerton. Cal s father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
This is crazy.
Could it have damaged the ship?
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
I know, I know.
I ll be right back.
It s so cold.
I m so cold.
I can t feel my body.
I promise.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
You think she was really there?
Would you like anything?
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
Just tell us what you can
Of course I know it s gone. You remind me every day!
It s so unfair.
Any woman s crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
How d you ever get away with it?
Sure!
Don t be crazy I m tickled to death to see you.
This is Miss Marsh.
I ll join you later.
I can explain
Don t talk such bunk! She s one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
You mind your own business! She s an old friend of mine and I like her what re you going to do about it?
I didn t ask you to come away with me
And I can tell you where to get off.
Will you leave me alone?
Baloney!
We ll save you a place at our table.
Sorry I can t return the compliment.
I don t understand.
Montana?
No! Did you take that bracelet?
Lifted it out of a guy s cabin last night.
Stick up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Guess again, copper.
Oh, no I played with your cards in your cabin at your suggestion If you ve got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
I d like to be. Sailing on the Progress?
I wouldn t miss this boat for a million.
I ll say she is!
Very much
I could stand some more
Oh hello! I got the flowers. That was sweet of you thank you.
So you washed it off!
Good by.
Good by!
Sorry got an appointment to play shuffle board.
You re not very ambitious, are you?
You work too fast for me, young man.
Never eat before the show.
Brett is the name.
You are a lunatic!
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
Nothing to speak of. What is this third degree?
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and
Very your mother?
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Well, I can t.
But I ll have cocktails with you.
At seven thirty?
Okay.
You re forgiven if you don t make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
Sorry.
A lot of things I d like to forget.
I can t blame the ocean it s you.
For once I m dead on the level crazy about you!
But
Sally!
You mean that?
Yes is it all right if I come like this?
Lonesome?
Yes you know what I ve been thinking, Sally?
I think we ll live in Europe after we re married?
You didn t? I guess I forgot to tell you
I ll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set what do you think?
Oh, that s Mrs. Rosson remember, you met her yesterday?
Just met her on the boat supposed to play bridge with her yesterday but she wouldn t so we played poker instead.
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
Lose? I won a little
What do you know about them?
You can live that down, can t you?
I m beginning to think you re a pretty swell guy.
Make it five.
Don t you know better than to talk to me with people around?
I thought you were a smart guy.
We didn t have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
No bank roll there, boy. Lucky I could get you signed on they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler made him talk. The heat s on, Shortie and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
It ll never hurt you Got any money?
No, you re not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren t you?
How re the tips?
I ll need it gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Come on I ll promote a card game, and we ll be sitting pretty.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
There s thousands of em!
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat and carrying a bag with S. M. on it. Funny her name s not on the passenger list.
No, sir?
Change?
Pleasure first if it don t interfere with business.
Are you screwy?
You take some awful chances.
Well, if that s the case, you re sure of winning the first couple of hands But what about after that?
Thank you. I owe you a dollar forty here keep the change.
What is it?
Partners, ain t we?
Me!
Listen, Runt Quick! Where s the ice?
Where did you hide it?
Don t worry about that. We ll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man s word is all that s necessary. What have you got?
Why, you wouldn t quit when you re ahead, would you?
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships
Sorry but I m on a vacation

But not nice enough to marry eh?
What s the difference? He s got more heads than he needs.
Very serious?
What do you mean?
Oh I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
Meaning what?
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean
Somebody s got to do it
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean how you spread across the sea From New York to dear old Europe just for boats to ride on thee
But I m not finished yet And your waves are so colossal rocking boats both to and fro Oh h, Atlantic, how I love you how I love you
I m getting seasick
Mr. Denby What do you think I ought to do with that part?

Chad Lother s on the boat, and I m worried sick about Sally
You ve got a gun, haven t you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
Don t ask any questions just give it to me.
Eh?... Oh.
They re a cinch to read Queen of Clubs Ace of Diamonds.
The country boy s about due.
About twelve hundred.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don t want it to end like that.
It wasn t smart. Even if you d gotten away without me I d have found you no matter where you were.
Because I want you will always want you no other woman ll ever take your place. I want you more now than I did that first night You ve forgotten all that, I suppose?
That s more like the old Sally a little bit of fire. How about Ned?
Thanks to me.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and
Of course not but isn t it a coincidence that he s from the eighteenth precinct where they made the squawk?
Just smile again and be reasonable. I ll order dinner here just the two of us like old times.

Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
You didn t have a gun in your hand last night?
S pose you ve never thought of killing him
Why?
Exciting, wasn t it? Where s Jimmy?

I laugh sometimes

Where do you get these questions?

McMasters, isn t it? Listen, you Seen a black stallion with
I m not a lawman, I m just a Private citizen getting my Property back
If I had to explain it you Wouldn t understand. Just say We re brothers to the bone.

Wyatt, I know what I m doin.
Curly Bill, huh? Who was that Other idiot?
No, I gotta do something. I don t Suppose you d card
Which part? The Colonel s? Or yours?
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information. Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
Sir Elliot.
I see.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
Yes. I can see: You ve hung the rest of your relatives.
So why did you leave?
They re merely tools to disseminate information.
... Words to live by?
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor... And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium
Retired. I m not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
That hardly makes up for the imposition. Now, for what I hope will be the very last time pay attention, 007. First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog ical influences here, likely vector ing of the ship s coordinates here.
Not a clue. I didn t lose the ship. Next, your new personal communicator. Picture phone, fax, beeper.
Four wheel drive?
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Is that any way to say hello?
Is this another one of your games?
Shhhhh...
Leave me alone! He s going to kill me!!
Q s retirement party. I d just put the knife into the cake, and
How is old Q?
Fishing?
Plastique explosive shoelaces. Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
Moving along A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader anywhere you re in.
I see...
If you can t do the time, don t do the crime?
I am not here, ol buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
Hey the world is my office.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body find where the ship sank. Where did you get the boat?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
I envy your undercover assignments.
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Who knows? Fog, night...
Interesting video tape.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don t have my new cards yet.
Happily.
Three. You? Married?
Thanks. Take care
And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor. James Bond.
Chaperone. I m waiting for my dinner date.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn t carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
I see my date is here. And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she s on a seduce and destroy mission through life...... But she won t kill us.
No. First, because I don t think it s in your nature. And second, because there s no gold down there.
You re not.
What?
That s funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
He was my father s best friend!
You are seriously deranged.
Are you listening to me?
... You know, that s another reason you re probably not in a successful relationship.
If not?
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
First, that boat is in international waters. I m claiming it for salvage. One third of that gold is mine.
If you think we re going to have some kind of life affirming romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear: We re going to have it where I want, and when I want.
Of course.
... Didn t we once investigate Harmsway?
I have an excellent teacher. Make sure you wear the uniform?
Sabotage?
Ja shwa tsway. These are lips.
Stop it!
We ve already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
I told you! He was there!
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
Approaching the first gate.
You have to leave
Fueled and waiting.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
It s Bond!
Who is it?
I don t know. He s not in the database
Maybe. Maybe not.
Will the cruise set it off?
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife s work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
Now how far would further out be?
Don t bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
Go back to sleep.
You all act like two roosters.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
Hush.
Hush.
No, I m too hot now.
I wouldn t care if I drop dead if he learn something from it. Son, you make me wish I was dead.
Just stay in bed and rest.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
You must have been really sick.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
What happened to your hand?
I don t want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You re being irreverent.
I don t want to hear any tales about colored people...
I don t care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
Why didn t you catch a plane?
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
Everything these days is made overseas.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn t have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don t give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don t plant old ways...... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you. It s when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don t want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what? I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we ve experienced has no meaning.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
You should go back and rest.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn t miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say " go on in there brick and hit somebody " and it would find its mark.
He wasn t able to get out of bed today.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I m going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Let me get you a cup?
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
You must have done something to her.
Hattie is a different person now.
I m glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Now who are we talking about?
Wasn t Hocker lynched?
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
You damn right they didn t, especially Emory, my cousin.
That s nice.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can t feed all the hungry.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren t saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
I know your mother ain t still operating that house of hers.
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don t take me wrong but you can t judge people by how you act. You re a caring person.
Ya, but you can t do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I m not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
What s a toby?
I thought you weren t old fashioned.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain t no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
Junior s wife kept her afterbirth in the refrigerator. That s why I do not eat over there now.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla s daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn t leave the house.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn t. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
He s just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
Why not? Harry says that s the only way to do good.
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
I know you didn t but you have been so thoughtful.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
T O Y. Toy.
No, you can t.
You can t!
Can t! Can t! Can t!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer! Prove it.
You re mocking me, aren t you?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
That s why. Sid.
Trouble?! Where?!
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
But we re not on my planet, are we?
Shut up! Just shut up, you idiot!!
This is the perfect time to panic! I m lost, Andy is gone, they re going to move from their house in two days and it s all your fault!!
Oh, yeah? Well, if YOU hadn t shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me
Uh huh. And when we get there, we ll be able to find a way to transport you... home.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Hey!! Hey! How are you doing that? Stop that!
Don t tell me what to do!
Sh h h h h!! Quiet, Buzz.
I can t help. I can t help anyone.
Andy s house. Sid s house. What s the difference.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly. You were right all along. I m not a Space Ranger. I m just a toy. A stupid little insignificant toy.
Yeah, right.
But why would Andy want me?
Come on, Sheriff. There s a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let s get you out of this thing.
What?!
I can t do it! Take care of Andy for me!
Woody! The rocket!
This isn t flying. This is falling with style!
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o clock!
Eh, he s puttin ' em in backwards!
Did I get my package in the mail?
Whaddaya mean, you don t know?
Oh no, Hannah!
She s sick!
I ll have to perform one of my... operations!
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur? A mean one? I just don t think I can take that kind of rejection.
Yes! Yes! We promise!
Hey look! It s Buzz!
Sir! No Sir!
This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Last present!
Juvenile intrusion! Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
No, Slink
Not now, Slink. I ve got some bad news.
But you re Irish!
There s no mirror.
Do you know you ve lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
I did like the music.
A sin against what?
It s as though he d trapped a real cuckoo inside.
Home is where the heart is.
She ll have to learn.
Is that all?
Go away.
Do what? Oh, I see.
You re not so old yourself!
Well... yes. All right. But
Finn
I finished it off.
He ll be looking for another apprentice.
I ve got a present for you...
H m?
It was only a mouthful!
Did you now.
So did I.
So had I.
We re too young.
Juliet who?
Victoria
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
I can t find Manolo.
He never came home last night. Was he with you?
He has debts. He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
I want to believe you. I really do.
Why are you talking like that?
What is he being charged with?
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
You re gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl. We get Adler and we beat this thing.
Arnie, I need money. Somebody threatened my children. They want a first payment of three million dollars.
Arnie, help me. Doesn t anyone owe us money?
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere. I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
I tried, Arnie. And, I will continue to try.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
What?
I was just waiting for the right time.
I just didn t want to take a chance. I didn t want to risk it. It could have been frozen along with everything else.
Carl, that s insane.
Carl
That s frustrating.
Me, too.
Honey, this is difficult, but we ve all had our moments. I tried
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Why?
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own. We have to allow her space
Six months. I found some marijuana, that s all. And a little pipe about two inches long. I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank
Barbara
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
Look, I m as worried as you are
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day. That s different.
Me, too.
So s the video camera.
Caroline
Not yet.
I don t know.
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving? You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
Hi.
Just watching you.
How s David? How s David? He s terrific, Carl.
How? Supportive letters from prison while I m being kicked out of our home? Do you have any idea what is happening out here? Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien. Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging. Nobody will help us. Nobody will take us in. Nobody wants anything to do with us. So tell me, Carl, how you re gonna make it up to me. Tell me again how we ll get through this, and maybe while you re at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
Will we get invited to the White House?
How long s the job?
You can t make me.
What is this, like freebase?
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind
Have you done your homework, honey?
I think so. If she didn t she should have. I ve only got maybe an hour. Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
I feel good.
She ain t in on it.
I m telling you, she doesn t know shit.
So does half of San Diego.
Maradona is a cokehead. Hand of God, my ass. We re wasting our time here.
Oh, man, I ve never eaten so good in my life. Why don t you develop a useful skill?
Depends who it s from.
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff. Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me. Definitely third category.
Depends on the state.
No
Not Tiger Woods.
I m on a special phone, may I speak freely?
You re kidding. Can t you shoot him or something?
When will you do it?
I am a legitimate business. Fishing boats. Tuna. Check it out. Tax records, everything
You can t visit me here. I want my lawyer.
It s a death sentence. I ll never make it to the trial.
So you pay off our customs officials?
I got greedy. I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off. That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
You re breaking my heart.
So go shower already.
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
I don t know, sir.
No, this is not possible. And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it s been a pointless journey.
I hear these stories. Your husband in jail. His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala. Your route is compromised. Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
You don t? Listen to this woman in a man s world, a very violent world.
I don t know. Perhaps I remember something.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo. That s nothing new.
I m six months pregnant. I won t do it.
It should be... It s yours. I want our debt forgiven. I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States. And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
That s crazy. My husband is on trial for smuggling.
Yeah.
She s nosy. She hears me on the telephone.
Who?
Your new friends.
Oh, really. General Salazar was there?
What?
Where?
We agree.
We thought maybe you d have that kind of information for us.
Javier Rodriguez.
An informant.
If I can.
What is it you want me to do?
Only if he can be trusted.
But will he be house trained?
I m aware of that.
It could mean that, yes.
It s possible.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
Noriega is a criminal.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
Any idea how much?
What do you look for?
Any way we can do it better?
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
This is a business. Get the fuck outta here.
I have money
I ll pay you a thousand dollars. I have it in my wallet.
She snuck away. And we haven t seen her. She hasn t come home.
She hasn t called you?
I don t know what to say.
You won t say anything to my parents?
We sometimes went downtown to score.
The West End. We buy it off the streets. I can stop, you know, and she can t. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it s like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it s different
I can t believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
I d like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we ve been able to develop on your cartels.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year. But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force. We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
Yes, I hope so as well.
Like you protected Landry?
What? I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
I ll get there as soon as I can.
Your dad s a doctor. Call him
What kind of research?
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
It s fucking boring after a while without the cards.
It s fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Bit fucking late, like.
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
Shag her senseless.
You ve stabbed me, man.
But it s not worth more than fifteen.
Sorry, mate, I ll get you another.
Look, I m sorry, I didn t mean it.
Can you not go yourself.
Jesus.
I d fucking kill you.
Thanks.
Diane.
I m going home.
It s where I live.
What?
Eh
Ssshh!
Right. You can t sleep here.
Out.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It s up to you.
Because it s illegal.
No, not holding hands.
Easy for you to say.
Are you clean?
Is that a promise, then?
Calm down, I m just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
I wouldn t mind a bit, if it is.
Smells like it.
It s Iggy Pop.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
Unless you get caught.
So why have you told me about it?
I ve got a boyfriend, Mark.
That s right: going steady for four weeks now.
Sixteen next month.
It s an interesting theory.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
Exactly. I m not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there s Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn t know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
Now?
It ll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather
Oh, really?
Of course, the motto, the motto
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There s no need for you to get you " foot in the door ", as you put it.
No, I ll wash them. I ll take them home and bring them back.
It s no problem.
I d really rather take care of it myself.
No.
No.
Aye.
Aye.
I m sorry, Tommy.
No, I m clean.
Cheers.
Yeah.
Right.
And you might get the fucking job.
Nightmare.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can t answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
Another dab?
Goldfinger s better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
Nineteen sixty seven.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Lewis Gilbert.
Eh Ian Fleming?
OK, so who was it, then?
But you re looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
And I wondered if you d care to go to the park tomorrow.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set up.
Roald Dahl.
What do you mean?
Some of his solo stuff s not bad.
So who else?
What about The Untouchables?
Despite the Academy award?
Right. So we all get old and then we can t hack it any more. Is that it?
That s your theory?
It wasn t my baby. She wasn t my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn t mine. Spud s? Swanney s? Sick Boy s? I don t know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
It wasn t that bad.
What?
No, he didn t make me touch it.
He made me lick it.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
When are you going to visit him?
You re all hear.
Fuck you.
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
Well, this guy I ve met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
There s a mate of swanney s. Mikey Forrester you know the guy. He s come into some gear. A lot of gear.
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They re fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he s done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this.  He s looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney s nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. 
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
Four Grand.
We re two thousand short.
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you ve been saving up down in London.
Are you serious?
Well, it s up to you.
Sure, sure. I ve heard it before.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
You ll need one more hit.
Your favourite dish.
Your usual table, sir?
Stick it on my tab.
And see when I get out of here. I ve got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you ve got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I ll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
Yeah.
It will be. It ll make a change for three miserable junkies who don t know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
Such as?
It s really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
Look, Tommy, we know you re getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there s no need to take it out on us.
No joy yet.
Six weeks.
It s a nightmare. She told me she didn t want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
That s fair enough.
Went ballistic?
So what s it going to be?
What?
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they re OK, you know. Like Beggars.
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie one of my mates. I wouldn t say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we me and him were having a laugh and all of a sudden he s fucking gubbed me in the face, right
It is I. The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
Then I shall make use of this starship.
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
My pain?
Rescued at last.
Sulu! Look! The sun s come out! It s a miracle!
Plotting our new course.
Position, Bird of Prey?
Raise shields.
What do you know of my pain?
The power was within you.
Join my quest.
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began ultimate knowledge. But to find it we ll need a starship.
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can t miss it.
Why didn t you beep my communicator?
Captain, we re receiving transmission from Paradise City. They re demanding to know our intentions.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We re barely receiving transmission.
I m not trying to break any records. I m doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
Because it s there.
MM.?
I don t understand.
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
Spock, we re on leave. You can call me Jim.
Yes, Spock?
Go to sleep, Spock.
The same. He s apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
I cannot be certain.
Who is it he reminds you of?
What do you mean?
Why?
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
Yes, Captain?
Captain, what have I done
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
I did not.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
I have a half brother.
Why didn t you tell me this before?
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape proof.
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
Is what possible?
But the center of the galaxy can t be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that s done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you re green in the face. Until then, you re either with me or you re not.
A " t. "
Hmmm?
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
The emergency channel, open.
I was thinking of Sybok. I ve lost a brother.
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
You can t expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
The only realty I see is that I m a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
Now learn something about yourself.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Given to me by God. He waits for us on the other side.
The ship needs its Captain.
No conditions.
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...



" Let s see what she s got, " said the Captain. And then we found out, didn t we?
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
He s not?
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now
No. I will not.
I hide no pain.
I cannot go with you.
I belong here.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Tried to. Can t quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal...
" Embezzling " is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey... No, actually I m trying to get a legal brief together.
You invented Space Paranoids?
Senior exec.
I still don t get why you re trying to break into the system.
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
And Dillinger s instructions to divert them it s all there look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Yeah... pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Something about tampering. Some body s prob ly trying to siphon the R  D budget into his checking account, I don t know. Why are you so interested?
Flynn had access to you, too. I m not interested in talking about him.
Okay, okay...
You call that getting over it?
To warn him.
For being on to Dillinger.
Hello, Alan.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can t think...
Alan. Alan Bailey.
Oh, you have Group 7 access, don t you?
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons. Someone with that access has been tampering.
No, no, I m sure, but you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What s the thing you re working on?
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Oui, da, yessiree, sure nuff, you betcha.
For sure...
Right on the money!
It s our friend the boy detective. He s nosing around again.
Yes. It felt like Flynn.
I would if I could find it. it s stashed somewhere off in the system... out of my range. Meanwhile...
I m afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he s getting trickier all the time.
There s a 68. 71 percent chance you re right.
I m sorry
It s my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
The Pentagon?
Now, wait a minute I wrote you.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
If you think
You wouldn t dare.
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can t sit and worry about every little user request that
I m sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
I... have come to communicate with my User.
Hah.
Alan One. He calls me... may I pass?
No... Tron... must... destroy MCP... first...
Where did you hear that name?
The name of my User, yeah. But how...?
Greetings, program...
Wrote the...?
You wish. Man, I haven t had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin what it looks like you re supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what s goin on.
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most the time, that s how it is for Users, too.
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions... rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
How about you?
A little... Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that s the Silicon Valley...
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head Are we there yet, Mommy?
Why? What are you going to do?
Look... just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
How bout yourself?
The tower, yes Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself like what sector you re from?
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for...... probably Program Assist Routine well, it sounds like a lovely place.
We re inside a Recognizer... You are crazy stealing a Recognizer
We have to talk.
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
Swell... I ll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
Well, just don t forget your old friends when you re rich and famous.
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
I ve got a little challenge for you, Sark a new recruit. He s a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
Now get this straight, pal no one User wrote me. I m worth a couple million of their man years! I m bigger than all those little wimps put together! Humans they can t even keen their social order in one piece
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us
We ll get them, sir... These things take time.
Another free program off line. What s his User s posed to do?
That s all going to change, Yori...
Why is everything... like this?
Power surge... the transmission beam s too strong!
It s something Users do.
So I guess you didn t get away  for the weekend after all? 
I m shocked.
Girlfriend, you got a man. You  just have to take control... set up the right mood. 
Just an hour? You should tell this stud to take more time.
Out. If Dad doesn t care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I m going to a movie.
Where are you going?
Where are you off to young lady?
He lies! I was there! I was in the nurse s office, cause I had a headache.
Great! You re going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Yeah, Dad.
Okay, Dad.
Yeah, right.
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Alright, I want a complete workup on her. Do we know where she is?
You re kidding.
Yes.
Why?
For Dana, schmuck. Bring your kid something. You know. The dad thing.
She knows not to steal. I ve taught her better than that.
Don t be ridiculous. She s only how old is she?
I thought you moved out.
Son of a bitch!
You want me to just hang?
Something to do with Helen, is what I m getting.
It can t be. Not Helen.
It can t be.
I still don t believe it.
Put a tap on her phone.
Yeah, but for who? 
What are you talking about?
Aw, it s gotta be a typo
You tell on me, I tell on you.
What about that time you trashed a six week operation because you were busy getting a blow job?
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker. You must work for us.
Let s go. I ll brief you in the air.
But you didn t. Why not?
No! Never!
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
Yes sir.
Very good. It s sixth century B. C. Do you like the period?
It s certainly... dramatic.
Yes what?
Oral hygiene?
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Fine, honey. Stay asleep.
It s not okay. It s extortion.
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that  you ll be home at eight. I don t  want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
I ll just be a second. So what happened tonight at the office?
What d you do, honey?
It sounds wild. So now you re a big hero, right? For fixing their system.
They must ve just missed me.
He needed my help.
No.
Harry? What can I say about Harry? He s a sales rep for a computer company.
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
Yes.
What did you need?
Do you still love your husband?
Louder please.
Yes or no.
You will be contacted with the assignment.
No one must know! Especially him. You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing. The security of this nation depends on it. Can you do that?
Think carefully. You will be lying to the man you love. The person who trusts you the most.
The code name of your contact will be Boris. Your code name will be
Let the hooker go. She s not important.
I don t know what this crazy bitch is on. You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
Yes.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
My God. Have you had to... have sex with other women in the line of duty?
What about Juno?
Did you pork her Harry?
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
God, you have great legs.
What?
Yes.
And you ve got one.
So what s your angle?
So you re basically lying your ass off the whole time? I couldn t do it.
Isn t that hard to keep up, in the long run?
Use em and lose em.
What about the husbands?
You son of a bitch. Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I m a legal secretary.
Get going!
I m Helen Tasker. Harry s my husband. And you are?
No, my dear, he is a federal agent. He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Helen? It s Simon. Is it safe to talk?
I kept looking back, like you taught me. I didn t see anyone.
I understand.
Ssshhh! We say Op. Covert  operation. And this one got a little rough.
Yes.
I m sorry, I can t.
I know. But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
Three of them. Hardly worth  talking about. Two won t bother  me again.
Not here. I ll call you and we ll rendezvous again. We have to leave separately, so we aren t seen together. For your safety.
What is it you need me to do?
I m married!
We re going to Paris?
I don t know. I have to think...
It s just that... it s been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I
Helen.
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now? Your phones are almost certainly tapped. And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a
Find out who this Renquist it.
His wife.
Hello, Alabama.
What letter?
Yeah, my room mate leaves it on the TV.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
How come?
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Yeah. I m fine. It didn t hurt.
It s OK. Don t worry about it. Accidents happen.
The oriental.
Want some Goobers?
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the " Streetfighter ". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Is that your real name? Really?
I took a cab.
Sure. Why not?
What time is it?
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
Well, it s just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It s sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you ve seen a good movie?
Would you like to get some pie?
How bout me what?
There s nothing to tell.
What do you want to know?
What do you do?
Where are you from.
What s your favorite color?
What s your favorite movie star?
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Very much. Now, where were we?
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like " He s a Rebel ".
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis s voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
I m sure there must be something, but I don t really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
What s the story behind you takin a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
Almost four years.
I m hip. But you know, I m comfortable here. It s easy work. I know what I m doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I m friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
That s where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let s you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what " Spiderman " number one looks like?
I didn t even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
At the movies?
What would make you think that?
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
Yeah, she OD d. But wasn t on her last legs or anythin. She didn t take too much. It shouldn t have killed her. There was somethin wrong with what she took.
That s what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She d been fucked over so much by men she didn t trust them. She was havin this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn t be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, " Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I ll sign it. " So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
You didn t do nothing.
Clarence, I ve got something to tell you. I didn t just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
I m a call girl. There s a difference, ya know. I don t know. Maybe there s not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
I don t know. I didn t talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
It s over on the TV. All it says is: " Dear Clarence. " I couldn t write anymore. I didn t not want to ever see you again. In fact, it s stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don t know... I felt... I hadn t had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, " Alabama, come clean, Let him know what s what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself. "
My pimp.
Uh huh.
Uh huh.
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he s lying.
Well, I wouldn t go so far as to call him nice, but he s treated me pretty decent. But I ve only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
At the bus station. He said I d be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in " Dressed to Kill ". And when I was ready he d call em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder s fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one s gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn t know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I m doin for Drexl now is just sorta learnin the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don t really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn t feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
What?
You will?
I don t believe so.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Bottom of the ninth. Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
What?
Why?
You don t know him
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, " If I can kill em and get away with it, I ll do it. " I could. So I did.
What?
What?
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
You were chillin, kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I m gonna go grab dinner.
Really?
How come?
What?
You ain t kiddin, we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
Cancoon.
It s got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. " Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon ". Don t cha think?
Floyd say he don t be eatin pussy.
So you do eat pussy!
Can you live with it?
With that son of a bitch walkin around breathin the same air as you? And gettin away with it every day. Are you haunted?
You wanna get unhaunted?
Then shoot em. Shoot em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
I ain t tellin ya nothin. I m just sayin what I d do.
He don t got no right to live.
I don t blame you.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
Are you kiddin? He loves you.
You re tellin him what he wants to hear, but that ain t the same thing as kissin his ass.
She s with me.
I m her husband.
No thanks.
You got it.
Well, you re gonna be seein me shortly.
Tomorrow.
Get the fuck outta here!
Get the fuck outta here!
Well, she s a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
You goin out?
Good for you.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
I certainly hope so.
I know.
Tell me.
Drexl s dead. This is Clarence s coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I ll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain t got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time
Do you have any idea how difficult that s gonna be?
It s difficult because you re sellin it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don t know. You don t know. And, more important, they don t know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
He s nothing. He s in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
Hardly anything. I wasn t sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn t.
Elliot.
Elliot Blitzer.
Where?
The zoo. What are you waiting for?
What s to think about?
Two guys.
Yeah?
In case.
In case they try to kill us. I don t know, what do you want me to say?
Really?
How bout me what?
What are we gonna see?
Who s Sonny Chiba?
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Want an animal cracker?
That you re unloading for two hundred thousand dollars
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
Look, Dick, I don t
What department?
The police department?
He trusts you?
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice cream?
Yeah?
No.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
No. No you re not.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it s just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
I can see what you mean.
Lee, Clarence. Please don t insult me. Call me Lee.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
I hear you talkin Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Don t worry, I ll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Well, Elliot wasn t supposed to tell you anythin. Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you re a piece of shit. He s not a dirty cop, he s a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
We grew up together.
Anything stronger? Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can t you?
Uh, yeah... there s a party store down 54th.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven t had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt. Where s a good chicken place around here?
She seems very nice.
Clarence, just shut up, you re giving me a headache! I can t believe how much like your mother you are. You re your fuckin mother through and through. I haven t heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don t get me wrong, I m happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
What?
Do you still have friends on the force?
Could you find out if they know anythin? I don t know they know shit about us. But I don t wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what s goin on. Daddy?
You were a cop.
I m your son.
Do tell. Why drug related?
No shit?
Nope.
Who is he?
That s what I ve been tellin ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren t looking for me?
I got some money I can give you
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
I give up. Who are you?
I ve heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
No.
Now I can t be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you re in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don t just mean pimpin, in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we re gonna do some business, cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin and didn t stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
I m talkin about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver s license in a dead guy s hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
That s of minor importance. But what s of major fuckin importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
I m gettin angry askin the same question a second time. Where did they go?
Uh huh.
What about him?
Are you still working security for Foster  Langley?
McTeague.
I don t see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Uh huh.
Sure was.
We talked him into it.
Not a tiny little vial
No don t sit here and feed us some shit.
You re no longer an extra
Or a supporting actor
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat slitting niggers, you ll have so much experience to draw on
' Course you ll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won t feed right anymore
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing s rotten in Denmark, cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it s uncut, too, so we re sweatin him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin the shit outta him.
To front for him. So Elliot is workin out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
You do.
How the fuck could he know?
How s he supposed to see the wire?
Rock whores.
Naw, man, it ain t white boy day.
I m tryin to find my jacket.
Naw man, I don t be eatin that shit.
Because it s good!
Why you trippin? We jus fuckin with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch you re with Jayne Kennedy. You re with Jayne Kennedy and you say " Bitch, suck my dick! " and then Jayne Kennedy says, " First things first, nigger, I ain t suckin shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush! " Now, what do you say?
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
You must be high. Uh huh. No way.
I m not gonna put that shit in my purse.
No way, Jos .
I m not wearing a bra.
No.
Naw, he ain t home right now.
Yeah, I live here.
Exactly room mates.
Naw, they ain t stayin here. But, I know who you re talkin about. They re stayin at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
No, I ain t been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
Do you know where we can find him?
Where s that?
No.
I didn t mean
What s she doing?
Forced you! Why would someone force you to take drugs?
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
Meaning...???
And your only goal is...???
So that...???
I need to go now.
" James "! Nobody ever calls me that.
No, not possible. Listen, I have to get out of here. I m supposed to be getting information.
It won t help you. You can t do anything about it. You can t change anything.
I need to go.
Because I m a good observer. Because I have a tough mind.
They wanted identification. I don t have any identification. I wasn t trying to hurt them.
No.
You wouldn t understand.
I have to go.
Underground.
I love this air. This is wonderful air.
It s so clean. No germs.
I have to go.
This is April, right?
July?!
What year is it?
1995?
No, 1995 is the past.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
What?
No more drugs. Please...
You told me you d help me. I know this isn t what you meant, but... I was desperate... no money... bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad. Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture. I can read, remember?
You d prefer that?... James... you don t really have a gun, do you.
What?
" If something really happens "... like what, James?
We dream about what s important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours. What was the dream about?
And I was in it? What did I do?
Clues? What kind of clues?
What will you do... when you find this... secret army?
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe... a hundred feet down doesn t know if they re going to save him.
Who s keeping an eye on you?
James, why don t we...?
I thought you didn t know how to drive.
What s the matter with your leg?
Shot! Who shot you?
No. I want you to turn yourself in, James It ll go much better for you if you do but I m not going to trick you.
No! I... don t think so. I stole a car and they chased me. I hit a tree.
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus. And suddenly, I wasn t sure. We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all... fuzzy. The drugs and stuff. You think maybe I m the one who wiped out the human race? It was my idea?
I m... " mentally divergent ". I would love to believe that.
First, it s important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running. Okay?
Give me the gun.
You re sure?
We re avoiding the police until I can.... talk to you.
I thought I was in... prison again.
No, not really. It s... it s in my mind. Like you said.
I don t know I don t remember.
It was? I didn t... know.
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid. Where a boy...
... I had a dream about... something like that.
You said I had delusions that I created a world you said you could explain everything...
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
You... you left them a message?
Shh don t talk. Hold still.
If we can t change anything... because it s already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
I was here... as a kid. I think you were here, too. But you... looked just like you look now.
Right! You re right. I have to fix this.
I need to make a telephone call.
I m not crazy.
If you know how to escape, why don t you...?
What s that mean?
Wiping cut the human race! That s a great idea! But it s more of a long term thing right now we have to focus on more immediate goals. I didn t say a word about " you know what ".
It s private.
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load! Listen up try and get it together. Focus! Focus! The plan! Remember? I did my part.
You do know me. You helped me once.
Listen to me I can t do anything about what you re going to do. I can t change anything. I can t stop you. I just want some information...
I get it! This is your old plan, right?
Remember? We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the... desecration of the planet. And you said to me, " Wouldn t it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are? " You do remember that, don t you?
And that s when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, " Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it! "
How did you find me?
The call I just made? Five minutes ago?
Hey, man...
They gave you a pardon, man. Whatdaya want?
She knew about it, Jeffrey. She knew you were going to try this.
You re insane, Jeffrey.
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do? I don t have to tell you I m afraid.
You really want to know?
Your psychiatrist? Did you just say, " your psychiatrist "?
He s been tested for drugs?
You want to go in? Examine him?
James Cole. That s everything we got. None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants. Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
You want something, old man?
You want something?
You can t do that yourself?
I m sorry, I didn t
I don t know. I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
Christ no!
I said I was sorry.
Yeah, sure. You got change?
I hope you wasn t pettin him none, was you?
He s only just dead. What was I supposed to do with him? I can t take him away anywhere. And nobody wants to take him for me. Do you?
Just cause I ain t got eyes doesn t mean I can t see.
I can see just fine. For example: You re a young man who thinks he s got someplace to be.
Or maybe you just think you do. You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
What do you want for free?
That s cause I ve done a lot of living.
I m a little short. I ll catch you next time.
Ain t over yet. Night is part of day; separate, but equal. Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin and turnin. It s when you wish the sun was bakin high in the sky so you could see what it is you re afraid of.
Afraid of it? Boy, I live in the dark. People are afraid of what they can t see. I can t see nuthin, so it s all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog. The kiss of death. It s all the same.
We was born to die, boy. From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head. You just don t know where, or when, or how. Don t make sense worryin about the particulars.
More or less.
We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn t plan on straying into town.
Well, a man with some gumption. How much money you got?
You want to make a kiddies bet?
Never heard of it. It s got no day or date. Hell, it ain t even got numbers. What s the matter? You couldn t afford a Timex?
That s my morning s pay.
Will be.
It is not.
It will.
I got more brains than you ve got teeth.
I need a ticket.
Out of here.
I... Mexico. You got a bus that goes to Mexico? That s where I have to go.
How much.
One way.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
I m sorry, sir. It s thirty dollars for the ticket.
You Harlin?
Harlin around?
Doubt it. He s dead. The Look Out s a cemetery.
Yep.
' Cause Harlin used to own it.
I know it s busted. What did I just tell you?
If I could do you think I d be standing here wasting my time. Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Yeah, I can fix it. Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Time.
Twenty after ten.
You got to be more careful. I remember one time
Truck stop up a piece. Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Hey, your... what the hell happened to you.
Don t look like nothing.
She s all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
Well... parts, labor... let s call it a hundred fifty bucks.
Hundred fifty.
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty four and a half Mustang. You know how long it took me to find that hose?
That s about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts. You re the one thinks that car s so damn fancy. What you expect but fancy damn prices?
That s not just a Ford, that s a sixty four and a half Mustang.
I don t know, but it s the reason I m living here and you re just passing through. Now you owe me a hundred fifty dollars.
Then you ain t gonna have the car.
I don t have a credit card. They took my wallet.
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, well, I ve been around the bend a bit.
You ve been there?
You believe that?
That s a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I m going I swear I ll
What?
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one fifty.
I didn t tell you to replace any gasket.
I didn t tell you to do it! You can t just do unauthorized work.
What reputation? You re nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
I m taking my car, and I m taking it now!
What s the matter? The fight gone out of you? I m just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
Open up!
It is morning.
I want my car.
What s it to you?
You got beer?
Let me have a Beck s.
Kirin?
Genuine Draft?
You know how that Toby is. Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
I think I burned my gun hand!
Yes. Yes it is.
I had a fight with Jake. I... I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose. I m going to take a bus to my sister s. I thought I d stay with her for a few days.
What do you want?
Don t tell him anything. He can t do this.
Wrong number.
I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
They look nice.
I picked them out for you, Jake. I thought you would like the colors.
You didn t hear something?
There s someone in the house.
What does it look like?
What are you afraid of? I m the one s got the gun. Stay here.
I m just going to my car.
My name is John. Now I m not a stranger anymore. See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
I don t know your real name.
Maybe, but if you didn t I think you would have kept on walking.
My cup runneth over, beauti
You sure you can manage?
What happened to your hand?
Oh, this isn t my car. It s down a ways. I should have parked closer. I just didn t think it would be so heavy. I could drive up.
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes. Had them long as I can remember.
I saw these in the Penny s catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
' Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending. But, damn it, I don t hardly ever do anything nice for myself. I deserve nice things.
You re welcome, Grace.
Why you say that? Just because I help a lady with her package?
I just drove in this morning.
Didn t have a choice. My car overheated up the road.
Yeah, my luck. I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
Not until my car s fixed. I don t know how long that s going to take.
All over. Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
I guess I ve got wander in my blood.
I don t know. I have to make a stop in Vegas. Business to finish. Then maybe I ll head to Santa Barbara. I might be able to pick up some work there.
If you re going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I m sorry. I didn t mean to.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess it must.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
From my father. He was the tribe s Shaman.
Those are white words, not ours.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want. What is it you want?
What?
Like you.
Like they re made of polyester.
I have ideas.
Games?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he s made of.
Still playing?
You know what I want.
Yeah, but I like the sun. I grew up on a reservation. The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us. Jake s the same way. He loves the desert. I guess we re alike that way. That s about the only way.
No.
Depends on what you call love. When I was growing up I had nothing. I learned to want everything. I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket. He s not much; he s older than me, different than me, but he s got more money than half this town put together. I courted him. I let him think he was courtin me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would ve done anything to get him. Is that love?
Yeah, I guess you re right.
You could just leave him.
You just walk away.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
From here? I don t know. Far. Far enough.
Yeah.
Beautiful. Beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
I can t.
Grace, I can t. I can t even get out of here myself. I need a hundred fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
Where?
You think Jake s going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
From?
You live pretty good.
How much money has he got?
One hundred thousand!? That son of a bitch lied to me.
I... nothing. Just something he said. So if the money s in a safe we d have to get the combination
If the key s on him, to get the key we d have to...
I think this heat is making me crazy. I was crazy to come back here, I m crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I d sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
I don t know what I was thinking, but I can t do it.
Kill someone. I can t do it.
It s not like he s a young man. He s had time to live.
I wanted to talk.
What about us?
Except I can t get you out of my head, Grace.
Stop it.
Because I know you re full of shit.
I thought you couldn t leave. I thought you couldn t get your car.
Is that what changed your mind? The money?
Are you sure? About me, I mean?
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake. But I ve had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we ve got to get the money, baby. We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
What was I supposed to do?
I don t know.
I m not sure where it is. Not exactly. I never saw it. I just heard him talk about it.
There has to be!
This is good. This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us. They ll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
You re calling Jake stupid? You!?
What about him?
Never needed one. I ve never been anywhere. I ve got a backpack.
Where are you going?
Wait. What about... him?
I... nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a rock. Hurt like hell... that s all.
Yeah. Good thinking.
Damn you! What did you do that for? He can t prove anything.
Not me. Us.
Give him the money.
You heard me. Count it out.
You killed him!
Thirty thousand, that s all. We would have been free and clear. You didn t have to kill him.
He was going to
You re tense. What are you all uptight about?
Now what?
But you said we could be together.
What difference does it make? You killed Jake.
He was a crooked bastard. He would have killed us.
But I want to say with you,
I don t want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you. Don t you think I care about you?
I think I busted my leg.
I m here.
Where the hell am I going to go?
What for?
It s not locked. I left it open when I took out Jake s body.
You closed it, didn t you, Grace?
Bullshit, Grace. You were going to drive off and leave me here.
And you re not one to lie, are you?
Walk to where? We re fifty miles to the nearest town. It s going to be over one hundred degrees today. How far do you think you re going to get?
Yeah, they ll find you. Dried up and twice dead.
At least I ll have company when I die. Ain t that right, Jake?
What do you say, Jake? Should we trust her? No? I didn t think so.
I m her husband.
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I ll break you in half.
Didn t much look like you were hanging drapes.
A lot that means.
Accident.
Yeah, I know. More careful.
Jake McKenna. That s a solid name.
John Stewart.
My car overheated. I pulled in to have it fixed.
I ve got to make a stop in Vegas, then I m heading to Santa Barbara.
Got work. I know a man who s got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
I hope so. Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife: If I had known she was married
Wait a second
Like you don t know.
Would I what?
How do you know if you ve never tried?
Just ran into a little trouble.
No.
No.
I had a problem getting my car back.
I do all right. Real estate isn t a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell. You can turn a few dollars that way.
I was hoping we could talk.
About things. About your wife.
I do.
I did?
I think this heat s getting to you the way you re rambling on.
You re talking like a mad man.
That was just loose talk. I don t want anybody dead.
A man doesn t always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
And what does that make you?
This morning I didn t know how badly I d want to get out of this fucking town.
For that I d kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
How do you put a price on murder?
Make it twenty.
How much could you get?
I need thirteen.
I m not your boy, Jake. I don t like you, and I don t like what you are. I got no choice but to do business with you. This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Do we shake hands?
The sooner it s over, the sooner you re on your way. Now listen to me: It s got to look like an accident; that s the thing. If it doesn t, then it s no good. I won t get a dime, and it s my neck that ll be on the chopping block while you re living it up somewhere.
How the hell should I know? I ve never had a wife killed before. I guess I should have hired a professional.
Is the job done?
You didn t kill her?
You re out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn t right? What s the matter? You were hoping to get it on home video? A keepsake for the grandkids. Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
I know all right. I know you re just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man s wife. You ve probably bagged a few at that. You d probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice. From that you d just turn and walk away. But to kill; to get that blood on your hands. You can t wash that off. You d be a marked man for life. Just like Cain. And you re a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain t that right, boy?
I guess I have what you d call a love hate relationship with Grace.
I hate loving her. I hate the kind of her person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays. I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise. And I certainly love her too much to kill her. I couldn t stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. But you? You got the killing in you, boy.
Came close this time and it scares you.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
Thirteen thousand dollars. Had you done it. Isn t that what we agreed on?
All I have in the world.
Trouble with the car again?
Darrell giving you problems?
Fifty dollars more. That s a lot of money when you don t have a dime. And where d you plan on getting the money from? Maybe you thought you d pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
Maybe you heard old Jake s got some money stashed away and you thought you d help yourself to a little.
You thought you d come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two hundred dollars. Or maybe two thousand. Or twenty thousand. Who s to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, cause old Jake would be dead.
There s another reason? It better be good.
You came to take my wife from me?
Liar.
That s a thick change of heart.
That s a lot of talk. A whole lot of talk.
Wh... what are you talking about?
Come on, Jake
Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
Christ, Jake, please
You re not talking sense.
What are you... you can t... you can t kill me.
What difference does it make if I slept with her. You don t care about Grace.
I don t blame you. What man would? I admit it, okay? I came back here and I made it with Grace. But if you kill me you re making a big mistake.
It s not me you have to worry about. It s her. She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
You know what kind of woman Grace is. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra. What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn t doing the same for you? What s she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead? Let me kill her. All I want is two hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Aw, Toby, we weren t doing nothing. We was just talking.
What?
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
She s dead.
I ve had time to get over it.
Oz.
For what?
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn t defending you.
I wasn t going to fight for you. I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Get it through your head, little girl; I m not going for you. If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I d marry him. You re not going to get much better in this town.
How old are you?
What the hell are you talking about?
That s not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
You expect me to believe that?
Mister, I m calling you out.
You know who I am? Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
' Cause I m just like dynamite. And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
Not before I settle with you.
Stand up.
What the hell are you doing? Are you crazy?
You stupid punk! You don t even know what you re fighting over!
Give it to me!
I m leaving. You never have to see me again. Just please, give me the ticket!
You don t know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that s not the half of it. I ve got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
No. He gets shot by the old lady.
With a shotgun. It kills him, and it shreads the money. I mean, what are the odds?
A hundred forty five really.
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Yeah. What are you going to do? That Toby s a hot head.
What happened?
Jesus!
I guess.
No, sir. And I m not going to be around long if that s what you re worried about.
Not as bad as it looks.
Wouldn t know anything about it.
Wish I could help, Sheriff. But if you ll excuse me I m going over to Harlin s to pick up my car. Then I m getting the hell out of this place.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Sheriff, he didn t give me any choice. If I hadn t defended myself
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
I don t understand what the
What for?
There s nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Shut up! The both of you. Ain t neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy. Don t you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town? You smell like trouble. Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
Thirty thousand dollars.
Eh?
Hablar slowly, por favor. My ingles no es bien.
But, Senor
Senor, you need a doctor.
You want something, old man?
You want something?
You can t do that yourself?
I m sorry, I didn t
I don t know. I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
Christ no!
I said I was sorry.
Yeah, sure. You got change?
I hope you wasn t pettin him none, was you?
He s only just dead. What was I supposed to do with him? I can t take him away anywhere. And nobody wants to take him for me. Do you?
Just cause I ain t got eyes doesn t mean I can t see.
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that s where you gonna be.
What do you want for free?
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we re all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
Who s cursed?
So now you re going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don t think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There s always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That s the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that " om "! Everybody s got a mother. You don t rip up your mother. You don t rip up the Earth and take everything out. It s like the Cracker Jack box says, " the more you eat, the more you want.... "...
I m a little short Pops. I ll catch you next time.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
You afraid of the dark?
So, we re all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride. Is that it?
Not this twig, friend. I got plans.
No and I don t plan on sticking around either.
That s not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
You expect me to believe that?
Mister, I m calling you out.
' Cause I m just like dynamite. And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Stand up.
You idiot! You don t even know what you re fighting over!
Give it to me!
I m leaving. You never have to see me again. Just please, give me the ticket!
Who the hell are you?
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town. She needed a hand with her drapes. That s all.
I swear to you that s all that happened. I haven t so much as set foot in your bedroom.
You broke my nose!
Yeah...
Accident.
Yeah, I know. More careful.
That s a solid name.
Bobby Cooper.
An overheated car.
Live there?
You a sailor man? That d be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that. Just sail away until all he was was a memory. I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
It wouldn t have made a difference to you, now would it? Not a wit. Do you know why? Because you re a man without scruples.
Like you don t know.
Would I what?
How do you know if you ve never tried?
I was hoping we could talk.
About things. About your wife.
I do.
I did?
Boy I think this heat s getting to you the way you re rambling on.
You re talking like a madman.
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin pissed off. I don t want anybody dead.
A man doesn t always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
And what does that make you?
You love her, but you hate her?
Maybe... ten thousand. And that s a maybe.
That s a bit much.
I m not your boy. I don t like you. I got no choice but to do business with you. Let s just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
How do you want it?
You want to do this yourself? I don t have to do this, you know.
Oh yeah sure. Why don t I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I m at it. I know you... This is what you do: Go to the house to see her.
It s not what you think, Jake.
Wait a minute. Just listen to me...
It s the truth, Jake.
Maybe I don t like being played, like she played us today. Maybe I don t like that at all, Jake. I m just pissed enough, maybe I ll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior. What s she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead? Let me kill her. All I want is two hundred dollars to get out of here with.
What?
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
Cause she s dead.
I ve had time to get over it.
Oz.
For what?
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn t defending you.
I wasn t going to fight for you. I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Get it through your head, little girl; I m not going for you. If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I d marry him. You re not going to get much better in this town.
How old are you?
What the hell are you talking about?
Nope. Darrell.
Doubt it. He s dead. The Look Out s a cemetery.
Yep.
' Cause Harlin used to own it.
Darrell
It s your radiator hose. It s busted.
Well, you know so much why don t you just fix it yourself?
Somewhere else? Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
Yeah, I can fix it.
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Jesus. Twenty after ten and it must be ninety already.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important. Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don t know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
Diner up a piece. Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Hey, your... what the hell happened to you?
Don t look like nothing.
How much!?
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
About an hour and a half, because that s all the longer I ve been gone.
That s a Ford, not a Ferrari. You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
What s that got to do with the radiator hose?
It might as well be fifteen hundred dollars, because I don t have the money.
I don t have a goddamn credit card.
You son of a bitch! I ll have my lawyers shut you down.
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
Yeah, well, I ve been around the bend a bit.
You ve been there?
You believe that?
That s a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I m going I swear I ll
What?
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one fifty.
I didn t tell you to replace any gasket.
I don t give a fuck! I didn t tell you to do it! You can t just do unauthorized work.
What sign?
What reputation? You re nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Darrell.
Well, that key s not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn t leave me the trunk key.
Open up!
I want my car.
That s none of your business. Get the keys.
No.
Eh?
Hablar slowly, por favor. My ingles no es bien.
I m just going to my car?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
Do you have to call me that?
You re pretty full of yourself, aren t you?
It s Grace.
You sure you can manage?
What happened to your hand?
Oh, this isn t my car. It s down a ways. I should have parked closer. I just didn t think it would be so heavy. I could drive up.
You re welcome, Grace.
Why you say that? Just because I help a lady with her package?
I just drove in this morning.
Didn t have a choice. My car overheated up the road.
Not until my car s fixed. I don t know how long that s going to take.
All over. Chicago, Houston, Detroit. Just lately Dallas.
I guess I ve got wander in my blood.
I don t know. I have to make a stop in Vegas. Business to finish. Then maybe I ll head to Santa Barbara. I might be able to pick up some action there.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition....
If you re going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I m sorry. I didn t mean to.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess it must.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
From my father. He was the tribe s shaman.
Those are white words, not ours.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want. What is it you want?
What?
Like you.
I have an idea.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he s made of.
Still playing?
You know what I want.
How do you know he s still not here?
They hear you comin. They won t bother you. Just don t sneak up on em.
Yeah, but I like the sun. I grew up on a reservation. The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us. Jake s the same way. He loves the desert. I guess we re alike that way. That s about the only way.
No.
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That s where they stick Indians, Bobby. That s where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn t take it anymore. There s no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
I let him think he was courtin me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would ve done anything to get him. Is that love?
Yeah, I guess you re right.
You could leave him.
Walk away.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Nothing.
Grace, I ve been fucked over too many times, by too many women. You re becoming the queen of hot and cold.
Try me.
I m sorry...
Is it pretty?
Honey, baby, I can t. I can t even get out of here myself. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
You don t have any money put away, do you?
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
Oh yeah. There s nothing else with Jake. He don t trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn t think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he s got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
If the key s on him, how do we get the key?
I don t think we have anything to talk about.
There is no us, remember?
Stop it.
Because I know you re full of shit.
I thought you couldn t get your car.
Is that what changed your mind? The money?
I came back for you; this morning I came back. Before I even knew about the money. You re what I want. The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake. But I ve had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we ve got to get the money, baby. We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
I... nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a rock. Hurt like hell.
Good thinking. What s all this?
You don t know what it feels like to be free of that place.
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
Can t we just dump him fast someplace?
Then will you take me on your friends boat with you?
But I thought
Anywhere?
Hawaii. I ve read all about it. I ve dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I d kill to go there.
He was in love with you Grace. He would ve done what you wanted, you could ve made a deal and...
He was a cop, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
Let it go, baby. It s the past. I got a past...
You don t believe in anything do you, Bobby?
Don t leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
I don t want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don t blow this. Don t you think I care about you?
My mother died in this canyon.
Bobby? Are you all right?
Can you make it back up?
Harlin s.
No, sir. I m not going to be around long if that s what you re worried about.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
Where to?
But, in particular?
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like
How much?
One way.
What kind?
No Beck s. A 1, Coors...
No, we ain t got no Heineken. We got Miller.
No. Just plain ol Miller. Now you can fuckin take it or you can fuckin leave it.
What was that all about?
Virgil! Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
No baby, you got it wrong.
Wrong number.
I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
They look nice.
Yes, yes, hit me... beat me, please.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
You didn t hear something?
Aw, Toby, we weren t doing nothing. We was just talking.
I am Russian, da! I am also rich Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
What does that mean?
I don t want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
He s asleep.
I haven t been sick this year. I know that.
Do you remember me getting sick?
That s strange isn t it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
Yes.
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Yes. Is this David?
Yes.
Rust?
My turn. What s your favorite song?
What was that?
Think carefully?
I had a nightmare one night and I didn t wake you up so you could tell me it was okay. I think that was the first time. Does that count?
I don t know Megan.
Seventy five percent.
Skeptical about what?
In college. A car accident.
You ve misunderstood.
Not money. But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
Are you for real?
Is there a problem?
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
But not a knife?
Like what?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
It s an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it s based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they ve done something wrong... Or the level of what they ve done wrong.
That s not what I witnessed David.
I never said you couldn t be killed. I never said that.
What s he look like?
Send him packing. I m not walking all the way over there.
I want to sleep here tonight.
I won t make any noise.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
Just one
What things?
I ll help you.
No.
No.
I mean if you knew karate?
All of it.
I see.
That s great.
Know what?
You re lying.
It s my field. I represent athletes. I m an agent.
Is that right?
... See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn t play football anymore. If that hadn t happened, we wouldn t have been together.
Football wasn t the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I d be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn t that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I ve seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain. I don t hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn t give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game. It s not a thing many people would understand.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
I own a comic book museum. It s called the Limited Edition.
We ain t got it. We ain t got no money.
We was... lyin.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
What wife? He don t have no wife.
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
Asked what they looked like, that s all. Christ, maybe he s tough but he sure ain t no carpenter.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
You don t look nothin like me, mister.
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Three days. Are you hungry?
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely s.
Alice an Silky gave them... free ones.
You want... a free one.
Your wife?
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I ve seen a lot of... of men... who weren t.
She back in Kansas?
I could of... easy.
Like I was sayin you don t look like no meaner than hell cold blooded damn killer.
I m a damn killer myself, only I ain t killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Well, how about it?
Bein my partner. I m headin North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
For cuttin up a lady. They cut up her face an cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an her tits too.
Well... you don t look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
Huh?
I don t never see nobody anyhow.
No.
Huh?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
What business?
Well... I don t recollect.
He ain t dead? You didn t get him?
If he gets behind them rocks we ain t gonna get him... not without we go down there.
You missed him? You didn t...?
You still think he s in there?
Well, he s holding on to his shit like it was money.
Tell me right off if you see him.
You... you ain t gonna shoot him yourownself?
I can t see em.
First one what?
Yeah?
Well, I gu guess they had it... comin.
Lemmee see it.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an fancy clothes an all.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
You re gonna kill him, ain t you?
You ain t shot.
You sure you ain t armed?
A writer? What do you write... letters an such?
Huh?
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
Should be easy killin em... supposin they don t run off to Texas first.
Eleven.
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin but cut up her cunny, I guess.
Two weeks, I guess.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
Well, it ain t just the bed I m gonna miss. I m... Hell, Billy, I m sorry. I didn t mean...
Sally?
It s just... she s a Indian an Indians ain t... overfriendly.
Well, she...
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
You ain t like that no more.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
You ain t like that no more.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Yeah.
Beats the hell out of me.
You re marking us, Bill.
Kid? The Kid s shootin at us?
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Yeah... you said that last night.
Not for me. I don t touch it no more.
What he was talkin about... how them deputies had the drop on you an Pete...
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
He s dead, Bill.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Ned... Is that you, Ned? Ned, I seen... death.
I seen the angel of death Ned, an I seen the river. He s a snake, he got... snake eyes.
The angel... the angel of death. I m scared, Ned. Ned, I m gonna die.
Well, that s good now, ain t it, Bill? Seein Claudia an...?
Supposin he don t go to the ranch?
I ain t waitin, Bill. I ll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
Tom?
The Kid, yeah...
Tom? Only how... how if you didn t... didn t come back in a week... how we was to take half the money to Sally an say you was...
Did I what?
Steal it? Naw, I didn t steal it.
What?
Who said that?
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin spirits an gettin into scrapes an all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an... I ain t like I was no more.
Nothin s bent.
Yeah?
We ain t goin to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
See that scrub oak yonder?
He s blind, for Chri...
Yeah.
I don t like the question.
How many you killed, Kid?
Move the candle closer, I can t see.
He ain t as tough as you, Kid.
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an out the back window.
Three days? We could kill em tomorrow.
All of it. About him, an you an Uncle Pete... about robbin the Rock Island Pacific... an about them Missouri Banks.
Maybe.
We ll bury him.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
An if I spot em?
Just like that?
Yeah?
I ve been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
He didn t know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
 The nose is sharper. Smaller too.   lt;  lt; And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.  gt;  gt;
 lt;  lt; Are you sure?  gt;  gt;
I m having a stroke.
Edie, please. I don t want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
Goddamnit.
They ll never stop.
They ruined me tonight.
I don t know what you came here for, but we won t have any part of it.
I hope I didn t disturb you.
Umm...
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing.
You are a criminal.
Then who goes?
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel man? What s your story?
Can we stealth these guys?
Did you hear what he just said?
County. I was in for fraud.
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
Tough break.
You okay?
Well, I m sorry.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
They re pretty pissed off. They ll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won t let me in without you.
Maybe more.
Don t do this. Send her a card something.
Russian, I think. I don t know.
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened Everything. She knows people. She ll know what to do. If we can t get Kobayashi my way, she ll get him her way.
You know damn well, dead man.
Who s your boss?
Don t jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don t work with me if I work with you without knowing who I m working for. Now let s cut the shit. Who s the man?
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton s attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
Mr. Soze will be most
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I m offering you the chance to call this off.
You re lying.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
Who is he?
We want to meet him.
The D. A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint s lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D. A. comes out looking like he d been bitch slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Two hours, tops.
Someplace else, then.
Which is shit.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton s alive he ll never come up again.
Waste of time.
What?
If it was a dope deal, where s the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C. P. was
I know he was good.
That s been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I m looking at six whole months hard time.
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
He didn t have my lawyer.
No.
You wanted to know what happened after the line up, I m telling you.
He loved her.
Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I ve been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold  blooded bastard. L. A. P. D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don t sell me the hooker with the heart of gold. 
I don t think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you re covering his ass and he s still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he s using you because you re stupid and you think he s your friend. You tell me he s dead, so be it. I want to make sure he s dead before I go back to New York.
The D. A. gave me immunity.
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
Kobayashi.
Right.
And this is why you never told the D. A.
If there is a Keyser Soze he ll be looking for you.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
This is totally irrelevant.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
Give a guy a break, huh?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
Why didn t you say anything?
Wait a minute.
I don t.
I don t know what you re talking about.
Then why didn t you help him?
But Keaton...
I never heard of him.
I don t
He wanted me to live.
Edie.
Because he was my friend.
Keaton was Keyser Soze
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn t get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn t see him die.
Why lie about everything else, then?
You think he s..?
I m not bait. No way. I post today.
I 11 take my chances, thank you. It s tougher to buy the cheapest bag man than it is to buy a cop.
The district attorney s office will comply provided
May I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don t know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don t care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Abrams...
I m fine.
Yes.
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in seventy eight. Since then he s been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
The man s an ambulance chaser...
This is a nuisance suit. He s looking for small change. He s asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don t want to go to court.
Neither does he. That s where he loses. This man s scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
No. Absolutely, and we re going to see that it is not.
Well, of course, it s always dangerous...
How did you settle on the amount?
You thought it was just.
Because it struck me how neatly three went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
And no one will know the truth.
... yes. Get her on the phone...
Gruber...
It looks that way.
What does it mean?
... to get her heartbeat back...?
... almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Huh!
Nothing further, your Honor.
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a  Surprise Witness she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
It s a crime.
I wouldn t do it.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I....
I... yes.
I...
 They lied. Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
You ve just said you signed it.
You didn t write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
I thought I would need it.
... that s all right.
I doubt we ll have to go to trial...
I completely understand...
Hold on a second.
You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours... You don t have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years. Four years... my wife s been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
What you thought!? What you thought... I m a workingman, I m trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we re paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
... Deborah Ann Kaye...
Right. Who called?
... and you re going to do that?
Her doctors killed her.
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life. Her doctors murdered her.
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
I understand.
... that s perfectly all right.
Why is that?
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
My client can t walk, your Honor.
... things change.
I wasn t disbarred, they dropped the pro...
Thank you for seeing me.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
That happens.
Ready, your Honor.
What?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
I m an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you re losing my case for me.
And don t give me this shit, I was a lawyer, too. ' Cause I know who you were. You couldn t hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
Damn right I m done. I m going to ask for a mistrial and I m going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I m going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Overruled...
Mr. Alito, please.
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
... Would you, would you call him up. I ll give you my number, and ask him...
If you re selling something, I m late for work...
From the magazine?
How come you re calling me from...?
Yes. Price...
Kathy Price.
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
Missus...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
Still looking.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
The TV didn t work.
And what are you? A cop?
My ex husband was a lawyer.
Yes. It was, actually.
Who says I m the one that called it off?
Laura.
What if it wasn t you that I came back to see?
And are they going to get it?
Maybe what?
And is that what you re going to do? Is that what you re going to do...?
What...?
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Do you want me to go...?
I ve got to work.
You re going to stay here...?
Isn t there something you...
You re talking like a drunk.
Yes.
I... do you want me to leave?
I...
Who told you that?
And what makes you so tough?
Is there going to be a later...?
If I don t grow up... '
You, you don t under...
It s over!
What is that to you...?
No... no...
No.
I have to talk to you.
Dr. Gruber s not in.
He s not in, Sir.
Dr. Halpern s taking all his...
What the hell do you think you re doing...? What s going on here...?
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
... You re sposed to be in court in ten days and she s telling me you haven t even met with them...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago.... I try to throw a fuckin case your way...
What do you want?
... I m going to need your help...
I m going to help her.
They killed her. And they re trying to buy it...
What?
I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don t want to go to court is this getting to you...? You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
... he s a good man...? He s the Prince of Fuckin Darkness... he ll have people in there testifying that the broad is well they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don t fuck with this case.
Frank, but not now. Frank. You re trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call em back. You call the Bishop back.
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Forget it. You can t prove it. Sister s testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
... Gruber s not bad. GALVIN Not bad...? This guy s Dr. Kildare, the jury s going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler s, the author of the book, Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.... and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub nurse... All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water... '
No.
Right.
Right.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
I m getting it back. Don t worry about me, Mick. I m fine. D you find the obstetric nurse?
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak. '
Oh shit, what s today?
I ve got to go see Gruber. What s the best cigars you have?
I can t talk now.
D you find the obstetric nurse?
I m swell.
You use their witness.
Yeah. I m awake.
The Doctors.
... one of the other nurses?
All right. Who wasn t in the O. R.?
What did she do?
The History...?
The broad has disappeared...
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We re looking for Kathy Costello...
It s locked.
... we, we love her, Dick and me...
But what can we do? She don t know who s visiting her...
... You saw her?
You know how beautiful she was? Her husband left her, and he took her kids.... They, they, they d let you die in there. They don t care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They d take her in. Perpetual care. They d take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
I don t want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God s will...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that s when we filed in court. We didn t want to sue...
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross examine... to... to...
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
She did?
In New York?
You live in the neighborhood?
How old is he?
You re really... You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Mrs...
Yes.
Yes...
These are your initials, K. C.?
Yes.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes.
I did.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes, that s correct.
Yes.
Yes, the roving nurse...
We, we were rather busy...
As I ve said we had some more...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes. We were trying to restore her...
... we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
We d gone to Code Blue, we were administering electro...
Wait, wait, wait, you re saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Huh. And why is that?
How m I doing so far?
Should I?
Yes.
The Big Boy did...?
Huh.
Me, too.
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife s family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father s partner runs the company yard in the East Baltimore so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I d come back here. I ve always liked it here.
Almost a year.
No, I m all right.
Then?
From whom?
No.
I d say you d better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you re still the hard headed Scot, aren t you? Always were. Do you think I m making it up?
I m not making it up. I wouldn t know how. She ll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don t know. I call to her and she doesn t hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn t know she s been away... can t tell me where... or why...
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
Well?
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They re dependable, good boys
It s not my line.
We re going to an opening at the opera tonight. We ll dine at Ernie s first. Which is easier?
That s Carlotta Valdes.
There are things you didn t tell me.
But you knew about this.
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife s grandmother?
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
And when she goes to those places...
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
I I
What for? Who are you?
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
Do you live here in the hotel?
Listen, I m going to yell in a minute!
What about?
You re not far wrong.
You won t have to.
Your name. And
Who you are
And how you happen to be living here.
But you haven t lived here long.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
But before! Where did you live before!?!
I want to know who you are.
Why?
No, you don t owe me anything.
Dinner... and what else?
Because I remind you of her?
I ll get my car and be back in half an hour.
An hour?
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow morning.
Don t go.
I ll take care of you.
No, Judy, you don t understand.
No.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
Yes.
No.
Why?!
No, there. There s a good one. Do you like that?
But Scottie, you don t have to!
I m trying to buy you a suit.
They re none of them right.
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
Judy
No, I don t want any clothes! I don t want anything! I want to get out of here!
You can.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that s dead. And not even that, very much.
Ah, no!
Yes.
It should be back from your face with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
Wherever you d like...
You ve got a thing about Ernie s, haven t you?
Oh, no. You ll muss me.
No, Ernie s is fine.
Oh! You re supposed to fasten it!
How does it work?
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
I need you.
Scottie
Take me away...
No!
No! Let me go!
You can t. You re afraid!
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn t be able to follow you didn t you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
And she was the one who died. Not you. The real wife. You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Took no chances, did he? And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
Yes!
Your accident...
I don t know... Switzerland?
What are you going to do?
Some money.
I loved you, Madeleine.
No...
Oh, of course I remember that! But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Why?
Where had you been before?
This afternoon.
I will. You re terribly direct in your questions.
You re not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
I... didn t know where you lived.
Yes, I knew which one it was. It s out there, now. But I didn t think you d want to be brought home that way.
My name is John Ferguson.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
No, I wouldn t like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
Wander about.
Some people prefer it.
What?
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn t have run like that.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
You ve nothing to apologize for.
What?
Shopping?
Well... anywhere in particular?
Ah. That s what I was going to do.
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
Of course not! I m a wanderer! I d like to go somewhere I ve never been!
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
I don t like them.
Only silence. It s always like this.
No birds live here.
Here with you.
The tall trees...
Yes...
Long ago...
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
I didn t jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
No!
What?!
Home?
Vaguely...
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
No... it s in shadow.
A grave...
I don t know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it s my grave.
I know.
No. It s new and clean, and waiting.
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
No.
But I m the woman in the mirror!
I m here, I ve got you...
Why? What s happened?
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner
Yes?! But
No, never!
And it s a all real.
I love you too... too late... too late...
You can t.
Let me go.
To the church, I must go there.
It had to. We re in love. That s all that counts. Madeleine
Yes.
Why?
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
No three way stretch? How very un chic.
What s tomorrow?
More than you think.
Please! And what happens after tomorrow?
What are you going to do? Now that you ve quit the police force?
No, it s your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Why?
It wasn t your fault.
Johnny, the doctors explained
Well, you ve got it. And there s no losing it. And there s no one to blame. So why quit?
It s where you belong.
Nothing for a while. You forget, I m a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
To forget? Don t be so motherly, Midge. I m not going to crack up.
I ve never run across one like that.
Uh huh!
That s following a train of thought.
Normal.
You know there s only one man in the world for me, Johnny O.
Three whole weeks.
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You d think I d would. No.
That s Skid Row... isn t it?
He s probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Sorry, old man. Work.
What.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn t. And you re not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
How?
That!?!
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Yeah.
Who?
Do you know him well?
For what?
Nothing to tell.
You haven t told me everything.
Who s the guy, who s the wife?
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster s wife? Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Carlotta?
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you re certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Where?
Did you need it?
All I said in the note was: " Where are you? " That doesn t sound desperate to me.
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you d be so grateful you d take me to a movie.
Oh... this and that.
If you want to. Naturally, we won t talk about anything you don t want to talk about.
Good. I ve always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
What is it, a still life?
What?
What did you say?
I didn t hear you.
First of all...
You re interrupting a personal conversation.
Because my opinion threatens yours, it s poorly developed?
You re an asshole.
Multiple reasons.
Why was the floor wet?
You re pathetic.
You re not a team player.
You never were a team player. That s why you never had any friends.
The hell you do.
You have acquaintances business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
And you re a little fucking reject.
Don t you fucking threaten me I ll fucking kill you.
You can t keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
What?
What are you talking about?
I m calling the ambulance.
Calling the ambulance.
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First... are we sure she s dead?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
That is not an " option. " There is no multiple choice here.
There s more.
Just giving the facts.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
So I didn t fucking do it!
You don t think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
What about the blood?
Have you ever done this before?
What?
We ve already done this.
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won t rest in peace.
No we re not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can t do this to them.
That is absolutely not true.
I am not flexible on this.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
What does that mean?
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker s head.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
At the seven eleven.
They re on me. They re smoking me out!
Adam! Calm down.
It has worked.
They won t figure it out.
They re driving me nuts!
What?
Later.
There is no candy!
Right! That s exactly what I m saying. My father said, first of all, I m your father not your friend. I m your father.
No. I think it s fucked.
Don t ever stare him down.
I know and I m honored...
I know...
What.
I don t think so.
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
I got you.
Don t sweet lip me.
You re a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
I will call the police right now if I don t start getting some answers.
Where is she?
So who s the lucky guy?
Doing the bachelor party thing?
Sin City. Devil s Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day. Where s Tina?
She s still working?
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
No.
Shut up.
I m calling the police.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
I m talking about prayer.
Shut up Boyd.
He is not cracking up.
What did you ask me?
What is the question you asked me?
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
Say it again.
What you just said. Say it again.
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
I don t think that s such a good idea.
What are you going to do?
What does that mean?
I don t know...
Yeah.
Hear what?
Isn t it a little late?
I m getting really tired of your bullshit.
You ve got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn t function properly.
I m talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
Fine? Fine what?
I m serious.
You re sick.
Not a prayer.
The hell you didn t!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
You hate women.
True.
You have a King fantasy.
And what happens when you can t?
Israel doesn t have a King.
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
What s your point?
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad s for real, man. They scalp babies.
What? What s your point?
What?
They need leadership.
Not really, no.
You said nobody would miss her.
Ball park sausages.
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for " The Immaculate Reception, " his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America. Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park s, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
Goosed!
How about my Fatburger?
Government cutbacks.
We missed the deadline.
I think so.
I sent a lot of checks, I m not sure what all of them are.
Sent it.
Sent it.
Yup.
Yes.
I think I forgot the tent.
I think so.
Why what?
I didn t mean to Liz. I m sorry.
I m not playing around. I forgot.
How could I know what else I forgot?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent s.
What?
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
I bet you didn t forget the bachelor party checks.
I m just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
Well it s bad timing.
Right before the wedding?
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
He s a moron.
What are you talking about?
I asked you to marry me. I m ready for marriage. That s responsibility. That s growth.
Who else?
You don t like Moore? Since when?
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I ve known him since Cub Scouts.
He s quiet.
Why? What s his problem?
He s weird. And I expect more from you.
You re going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on " Oprah " that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
I ve seen it on television.
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask? Is that to much to ask!?!
Of course.
With all my heart.
Okay.
I m not. What s the problem?
What kind of seats can we have?
So what do we do?
Go down where?
Honey I don t have the time...
We re leaving in three hours.
I ll call them from the road.
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
We re leaving from Adam s. Come send me off.
I will.
Of course.
I love you.
Not yet.
I m working on it, I ve made three calls. I can t stop thinking about how much I love you.
Well I do.
What are you doing?
Nesting?
I m mad at you.
Hey. It s me.
We re on our way home. I just... we re running a little late.
No. Just like an hour or so.
Okay.
What!
I left a message. I think it s going to be okay.
I m working on it.
Well, can you come back inside?
Now?
Are they fighting?
Nobody s saying cancel. I m talking about modifying.
Can we just talk this out?
We re not canceling.
I won t even discuss it.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Yeah. You.
No.
Liz we ve got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
The prostitute.
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
Micheal, by accident.
It s too late.
She s in the desert. She s out in the desert.
She s not alone... She s... Boyd... Oh God... He s gone nuts... He killed Lois and Micheal... it s all...
But...
But...
What does that mean?
Like how?
The only proof is those bodies.
Move the bodies.
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
If you don t tie up all the loose ends it ll never be over.
You put him down or don t bother coming back.
I don t know. She s really been stressing out.
What does that mean?
I just want her to be happy.
You re not breathing right?
He s your brother.
Go for it.
Buzzing?
I don t hear it.
The wahoo?
The wahoo moment?
I think so.
What is it?
Did she believe you?
You can tell when people believe you. It s obvious.
A move?
Greenpeace?
My God...
Did he try to kiss you?
Yeah. I m thinking about Micheal s Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping " Immaculate Reception? " I ve seen that play. A lot of times... and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That s it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
I m saying it s luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He s paid the dues, he s ready, does all the market research, picks his shot " Pup Corn. "
I think there s a lot of truth in that. I m gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
... embarrassing, shameful...
The stone age.
A mutant species.
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
Take your time. I wish I had.
That s our plan.
I don t think that s a good idea.
I m well... The bus was late, wasn t it?... What was the journey like?
A very short while, Uncle. I ve been given permission to stay only a few days.
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise...
Who is she?
I know, Uncle, you ve told me that already.
You are spoiling me too much. I won t know what to do with myself when you ve gone.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Don t you ever see him?
How could anybody behave like that?
Evil.
And this innocent child.
Wasn t that cowardice?
It s my fault. If I d come to see you more often, if I d invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
You must listen to me before you go.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
I d be really ungrateful, if I didn t like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn t know where to turn.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
But what can I say to her, sir?
She won t even know.
Yes.
Fifteen yards.
That s it.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
And in the vegetable plot?
No, sir, it s nearly six o clock. Okay, let s get a move on! When are you leaving?
Thank you; but it s missing something.
He was asking for it.
Nothing.
No, not mad at all: she s rotten with religion.
I m bored. I m alone all day and I don t know what to do.
I think I d better go tomorrow.
Where s the dough?
Why?
It s about time we spoke to each other, isn t it?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
I know that you used to work with an architect.
Leave him alone.
Do they worry you that much, then?
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
I ll be ready.
She s left.
No.
Then let him go and he ll follow you.
How much do you want for him?
What s he called?
Are you sure it isn t contagious?
Things seem to be getting better.
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what s the use of them!
Stop this!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
Why not?
Where?
I m afraid.
A black bull came.
Very, very?
Yes!
When you are, miss.
I ve had a gutful of this.
I m only good at making people laugh.
I have a headache.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Today, a good girl.
From the terrace.
Can you tell us what s on the disc?
It s not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
I ve discovered something about Lindenmeyer 5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know... The harm done to the music students who used the device   it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
You mean a nano  tech synthetic organism.
If you try to run, I ll hunt you down and kill you myself.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
I don t know.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
Why d... you pull me out?
He was a computer program for crissake.
Real, my ass. It s an overblown game. Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
Don t give up, Parker. Not ever.
What about them?
Parker Barnes, I d like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
I ve seen worse.
She wasn t part of the deal, Cox.
Their weapons missing?
On my life, I promise you I will.
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can t be sure.
Don t blame yourself. In your shoes, I don t think I would have told Parker, either. So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
You think he s smart?
I think we both know who did. What s so urgent?
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I m giving you temporary re  assignment.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people s lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
Only because I got pulled out early.
Not from in here.
If Sid 6. 7 hasn t killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn t kill the transport guards.
No, but I ve confirmed the reelection rally is the target. How much C 4 is missing?
If I were you, I d get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
Sid is smart enough to know you d check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he s probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates. Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
Or what, you ll authorize my death a second time today?
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn t calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you. How you feeling today?
In other words, par for the course. How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing. If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
That s not true, Parker.
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
You didn t see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did. You kind of liked it, didn t you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
It was just like before, wasn t it? Wasn t it? But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you re after, this time there was only one other person involved.
It wasn t a lie.
Manson didn t kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
Charlie? You say that like you re close, personal friends.
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
Checking my pulse. It s elevated. You enjoy frightening me, don t you?
I ve been in prison, remember?
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
Hamlet. What s David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6. 7?
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory. We need to get a look at Sid 6. 7 s final profile.
Give me a goddam break. I m not going to go anywhere alone.
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Sid 6. 7 is no longer bound by his programming.
Now that he s in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
What I do know is that whatever he s becoming, Sid 6. 7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
You know, considering you ve only been out of prison for seven hours, you re re  adapting quite well. Wait, I didn t mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Enjoying yourself?
This isn t a game, Parker!
Start of what?
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Sid 6. 7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Think he s keeping track of his creation?
You mean there s something you haven t asked me?
You don t know?
... I think so... You?
Lindenmeyer?
Sid?
I couldn t tell you.
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I m carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn t mean we can t be friends.
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I m here... or whether I m not... I m leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
Let me put it to you this way... whether I m here... or whether I m not... I m leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
What are you talking about?
As long as you keep overpaying me, I ll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
You re with him tonight, watching the President s Speech, when the President...

Well, darlin I ain t your confessor. Tell him you ve got some info on the President s sex scandal, it s on your conscience, believe me, he ll drop what he s doing. Okay; Now: Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that. But in Six Days, Lord willing n Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term...... wait til you hear the speech tonight. The 3 0 3 Speech... where s the Fad King, by the way...
When you... What? I m busy.

No, No wait a second, no, no, wait a second, No. The Bomb s not... it s not there because they d have to have a rocket and that shit n they re a buncha wogs it s... it s a suitcase Bomb. Ooookay. It s a suitcase bomb, and it s.... in Canada! Eh? Albanian Terrorists have placed a suitcase Bomb in Canada, in an attempt to infiltrate the bomb into the USA.
It s producing.
Hello, King. How the heck are you...? Get out... Get out... Well, man, you fall in love like a Hillbilly... Ditch the wife, toss the kids in the Pick up, Listen, King: Get your fat redneck ass out here, willya...
... and he s got a negative rating of...
I don t think you re gonna need it.
They got the guys on a retainer, it s cheaper, pay em, but don t lettem touch it... Let em leave us alone.
I need a little bit of help...?
... can we have a white one...?
It s the gratitude of your party, and of your President...
... like the sound of it, eh...
... twelve years.
... and...
Look, look, look.... He s fine, as long as he has his medication.
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong. If you look at the backstory the guy s coming back from Combat and Torture. Of course he is gonna be... uh... uh... " fucked up ". Of Course he s gonna " need a little help "...
Come on.
... how do we explain that? With the World Watching.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
What rig?
What are you talking about?
He s dead. He s dead. The Fella Killed Old Shoe.
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
When it broke, he said one word: get me Ronnie Brean.
Who s got the story?
What difference does it make if it s true? It s a story, and, it breaks they re gonna have to run with it How long ve we got til it breaks?
You gotta give me a day. I need a day. He s sick, get it out now. Get him on the phone n tell him how sick he is. We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren t quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin. He s got some rare strain of...
All I need is the one day.
I m working on it. Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane right now to Seattle, y got that...? All flustered and worried. To talk to the Boeing people.
We don t need it to prove out. We need it to distract them for two weeks til the election.
What in the world would do that?
I ll be back within the hour. Now,
.... we landing?
Lookit, don t worry about it. It s not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
We aren t going to have a war. We re going to have the " appearance " of a war.
What s it gonna cost?
Who would find out?
The American " people "?
Who s gonna tell em.
What did they find out about the Gulf War? One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of Legos.
... that s the general idea.
Why not, what ve they ever done for us...? Also: they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B 2 Bomber...
Shifty. Who knows anything about em...
Well, I m gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject. You wanna change this subject, you better have a War. What do you need? It s gotta be quick, it s gotta be dramatic, you got to have an enemy. Okay? What do you need in an enemy? Somebody you fear. Who do you fear? Som b y you don t know.
Why?
... nothing...
What did Albania ever do to us?
... you want us to go to War with Albania.
It s like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The Hostages...?
In the yellow ribbon.
Hello... Yes. We ll be back...?
Tonight. Well, you ve started a Tempest in a Teapot.

Your guy gets four more years in Washington...... it s only Nine More Days.
Eight Days To Go
Big Bird touches down when?

Now, the Old Lady starts to Weep, Big Bird shrugs off his secret Service, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.

Well, I m not interested in how long its " got to hold for. "
I have a question for you.
Why do people go to war?
I ll play your silly game.
To preserve their Way of Life.
I have.
This ain t the illegal immigrant Nanny.

Earn your money.... He s ill, the Plane is sick...
Where d you go to school, Kid. Wellesly?
When s he coming back...?

It s not too clean...
Oh, he s gonna be Aces.
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
They got him standing by.
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
S only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit. Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
Yes, but I, well, you know...
... that s right.
Well, yes, but the guy did bring Peace.
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
Hell of a Ride, Stanley...
... we ll gettim in their cars.
Big mistake.
Guy says he ll respect her tomorrow, he might, but why take a chance? Hold out til after you re married. That s... that s.... looky, we re offering em Schumann, make em vote for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that s the bargain. Make them pay for him. Make... that s right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying home, he s here, he s there... f there the election, TA DA, here he is. Have him say it like I wrote it, It ll be fine. Thanks. Labor, five bucks an hour. If you watch, ten bucks an hour. If you help... if you help, a hundred bucks an hour.
Ain t that the truth.
What am I gonna do? I m gonna " Fade Away. " What are you gonna do?
I got it in the inaugural. " Thank you for voting for me, but, as importantly: Thank you for voting...
Of what?
Bigger than that. For want of a nail a Kingdom was lost...
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport. I told em they re wrong, I can t convince em. They re concerned that the last kid had the Wheat. Variations include, the kid is a boy, the kid is twins, it s a little dog... they rub meat on Schumann s cuff, the dog runs to him...
Cause I don t think this dog is gonna hunt....
Yeah, well, perhaps... Speaking of which: I have a prescription here, I m going to give you the number, I need you standing by with a crate of the stuff.... it s... what is it?
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
Get on your feet, boy.
We re going home. We re going home together...
Finish Strong! Are you nuts? Are you nuts? This s Pennies from Heaven... on his triumphal return home, Old Shoe, his Plane Forced Down... AND YET...
Why not?
He raped a Nun...
"... unsure whether or not Enemy Action... "

They ll be here in ten minutes.

No. You re right.
A proud tradition.
I m looking for a phone...
Watch me.
Watch me.
Deal s changed.
Money? You think I did this for money...? I did this for Credit. Credit, paalll...
It s too clean.
It s got to sound like an acetate recording, 1930.
Keep Talking....
He ain t seen nothin yet.
See y at the Finish Line.
They look stupid.
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
Isn t Johnny Green in the...
And what? What? She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists. It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is " she "?
Can we give er a kitten?
Better.
Yes.
... they have the capacity to Meld into the Woods, and...
I m just talking about the Hats.
A beret.
Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
No, no, no.... we ll punch in a kitten. Um... Later.
Yes.

He s not dead, Ronnie. He s just a little understandab1y, fatigued. Let s get him to some help...
That s right, we ll take a nap. We ll get you to Washington, we ll get you Back to your Buddies, and...

Susie? Susie. Are you alright...? Susie...
SUSIE...? Are you alright...?
What about tipping off Yurovich?
Please, no thanks...
Oh really.
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he s lying!
I don t think you re being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he s got a history...
... still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
... takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
You mean teach you how to play. Can t. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
Yeah, where s your machine gun.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I ve got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I m tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Hello, Natalie guess who? That s right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
Yeah, but he didn t see me.
... gotta read my reports.
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
All right, I owe you one Marv.
Didn t I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Then get out and close it behind you.
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
Start unloading.
Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D. K d me and I gotta cover his loss.
D. K. didn t know who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
Coulda been a contender.
Look Dad, I m not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I m an account executive, and pretty soon I m going to the investment banking side of the firm.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I m doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
50 K don t get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40  in taxes, I got a rent of 15, 000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that s  500 a pop, shoes...
It s Queens, Dad and a 5  mortgage and you rent the top room I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There s no nobility in poverty anymore, y know. One day you re going to be proud of me, you ll see...
... Work okay?
Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We ll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We re gonna compete with the big boys now.
About what?
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it s the...
Alright. Why so pissed?
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
Don t worry about the loans. I m doing good Dad and it s gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
... Dad, you should ve been a CEO. How about dinner?
Wait... next week s booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can t stand that his son s become more successful than himself.
That s because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you re gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don t do it to em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
No, thanks, I m nervous enough.
What are you doing here?
What d you tell him?
Look Dixon, calm down! It s not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it s not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
Tell em your father gave it to you.
They won t. That s not their jurisdiction.
Yes! Read the Constitution, it s all in there. And remember you don t know anything, nothing.
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
Like? Uh... hmmm. Well...
So you re hot on this stock?
Well we re thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you re moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How s Margie?
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
" What are you thinking? "... that was it. The hours are hell, but the money s starting to tumble in. I know this guy who s got an iron clad way to make money, I can t lose and I can t get hurt.
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it s still not over.
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven t read about in the Wall Street Journal?
Who s listening? It s just one college buddy talking to another.
Relax, Roger, everybody s doing it but you don t know, you don t know.
... got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
He never told me...
Oh no, no...
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you re an incredible genius and I ve always dreamed of only one thing to do business with a man like you...
Jackson, Steinem...
... Yeah, and we re working on some other interesting stuff.
Can t tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
A comer. 80 medium body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
... I can t even see it...
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
No sir, that would ve been illegal...
... put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it... and save the cheap salesman talk, it s obvious.
Mr. Gekko, I don t think I can... go on.
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps... I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that s the thing with WASPS they like animals but they can t stand people!
What? How do you know about my father?
' Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
I don t understand.
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I... It s not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It s inside information, isn t it?
... we have 37. 2 million invested. At this point, we re up 3. 1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
" All warfare is based on deception... " Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
Mr. Gekko, I m there for you 110 .
... Gordon.
How much?
I m talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It s gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I m up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
What does that mean?
What makes you think you can?
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
Why do you need to wreck this company?
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty four years. I gave em my word.
Tell me, Gordon when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
How much is enough Gordon?
... I can t make it tonight.
Gordon.
Excuse me.
Oh yes, I remember you.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
... few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
You could have a great beach house for that.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody s really taking him to the cleaners here.
I gather you re a decorator.
Well, if you re that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Upper West Side.
Break it.
You really do believe in destiny?
He s not a racehorse, Bud, he s a jumper.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
And what do you want?
Well, why stop at that?
I ll bet he s got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the " demolished " look. They ve already heard about it at House and Garden and they re coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I d love to have it in my portfolio.
I m kidding, I m kidding, we re still young, Darien. So what s money anyway when everybody s making it, it s all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years... before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
It s not me I m worried about... You know Darien, the only reason we haven t slept together is because we both know we will and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there... but you, me, the world.... right here... make love to me... now... Stop me if I m going too far.
... are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
You re so naive Bud, you don t even know. Your dad took care of you. I might ve been rich when I was a kid... but my father lost all his money... in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So... that s why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you re doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
You re not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Why?
Any better and I d be guilty.
Now that s a crap company, sure you ll make money on the takeover rumor, but what s being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
No such thing Bud cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What s going on Bud? Do you know something? Remember there re no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets. You re part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don t sell that out.
Can t get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
It s not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
It s over you, Gordon.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Don t worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding. I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn t fit.
You and I are the same, Darien. We re smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow em away Ollie.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
With Mark?
Oh I don t give a shit the guy s a slob. He doesn t even know how to spell  lady let alone treat me like one. You know the last time we went out he actually made me pay for a drink?
Yes, I m sure. What I need is an older man, something with class, a little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
Businessman!
Yeah, yeah, OK
But he still has something Mark hasn t.
About what? About us.
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of, not  hey how bout a pizza after class babe. I m looking for something just a little more in a man. A little  je nes se qua.
I m sorry I m not that good at languages ok?
Thank you Jenkins
Thank you
Thank you
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Jenkins!
Uh yes, thank you. It was quite enjoyable.
They seemed, closing by much
What? Tony and China, together?
Like her? I don t know if I ever liked her. It s just you want what you can t get.
I don t know. I really like you and I think you re very attractive.
That s not what you said last night.
Listen Sarah, I think I know what s going on ok. I went to the waxwork today. I met this man.
You don t understand. I recognized his face now come on.
Safety in numbers man.
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them. They begin walking around the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman. They give each other looks of disgust and continue on. The next is of a Frankenstein esque creature carrying a woman in its arms. The four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim. MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it. On the staircase is a zombie fied creature. We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man pumping gasoline into a woman s mouth. Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not. I ll get the maid to write the essays
It s only two hours away.
I ll come back all the time.
Mom, I m sorry. I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
No, he wouldn t.
That s not true.
So much.
What do you mean?
No. But once I heard...
Someone crying. A girl. I thought I was crazy.
Um...
Right. Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood. I m Claire Spencer. From next door.
She isn t here.
I don t know.
Give me that shit. Your wife.
It s Mrs... It s Claire... Spencer. From next door. Is everything
Um... yes.
Who? Your husband?
How? How can you help me? With your flowers and your perfect life...
I ve never even met you.
This fence... it s so...
You do?
And then you weren t there.
Thank you.
Of what? What were you so afraid of?
What?
Um... sure.
No. No, I don t.
This is...
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
... just so she could cut them off.
I came in from my room...
And there s this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
Stop.
Do we have to?
She s making this up.
Good. I m good.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Okay, I m a little tender.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
It soothes heart ache and promotes psychic wellness. Sela suggested I bring
She s not a psychic. Just a very enlightened spirit.
Yep.
Beautiful thing, alimony. Lose a husband, get a car. Think it ll help me pick up dudes?
Listen, I ve gotta run. I just thought I d stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
What?
Jody, no...
... no... no... no...
What?
The planchette?
I think so
It s alright.
Jody, she s alive.
Mrs. Feur. She s alive. I met her. She s really sweet.
Nothing. It wasn t anything. I ve been on edge lately. Maybe since the accident. And I d prefer, I really would, to just
Did I?
Hartford?
No. Jody, listen to me. You have to listen to me. This is not something that I can do right now. Whatever it was, it s gone. I need it to be gone now.
I was down in Adamant...
Why?
Relieved?
Too late? Jody, it was an accident.
What are you going to do?
If she was dangerous before
You don t know that. If it s your belief that gives her form, then you ve got to shut her out. Somehow you have to break the connection.
I know.
We need help. Please let me call the medium.
Like what?
Did he say that?
What if he was? Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you re trying to make a new start?
I don t know...
I think three...
Don t.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
Fine.
I am, really.
Not the focus.
You are...
Nope.
Tomorrow.
After that.
Of him I think.
I m telling you. There was something in her voice...
Not like this. We were never like this. I want to go over there. After dinner, we can
That s not what I m sug
But what if something happens?
I d never be able to live with mysel
I know.
Look, I ll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
Mmnph.
Unless you need me to come home...
In the house. I was scared.
No. Can you drive me home? I ll bring you back in the morning.
What kind of whispering?
You are so brilliant.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
You re kidding.
Well, that s nice.
Oh, no...
That s...
I m so sorry.
That s just mean. Oh. Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
What? No. No.
Did you call about the Feurs?
What s going on, Claire?
What?
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic
A flare?
It s her! I m telling you. She whispered and turned on the music. She s trying to contact me!
She could be out. She could be sick in bed for all we know.
What am I looking at?
Who did? Mrs. Feur?
Right. And why is she here? If he killed her, why doesn t she haunt him?
Claire, listen to me. I know you re under some strain. But there s no such thing as ghosts. They don t exist. Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I... wait, why aren t you dressed?
Dinner. With Stan and his new girl.
What do you mean? Claire, we talked about it. You didn t want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
... since Caitlin. You don t remember this?
... Don t get all...
Restaurant. Let them know we re running late.
I know I m not at the center of the bridge.
Harvey says he s amazing.
I never said I wasn t upset. Of course I m upset. I miss her terribly. But I know what I saw and what I heard... and it wasn t some " symptom " of something...
He killed her. I m not crazy. He killed her and
We had a seance.
Jody and I. And she was there, Norman, she was. It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
Maybe you resent how busy I ve been.
You know what I ve got at stake with this paper. You know that. I can t help but think that you re doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
Ever since the accident I ve been worried that you d been unhappy, or...
But then you ve been so much better...
Sweetheart
No, it s fine. I m fine.
Yep.
I felt you... looking through me...
I...
In the living room...
But why? I can t understand how I could just completely
But I don t remember.
Not personally.
It s her. This is the woman who I ve seen.
Stop...
... Please stop...
What s the matter?
Who?
Claire
Oh God...
So you fucked a student?!
What did you think I would do? Jesus Christ! I gave up my life and my music...
Who?
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
... would do anything just to be around me. And I slipped. God help me, I slipped.
You should have tried harder.
We don t know that for sure.
It s alright.
She s gone.
She can t be here without me.
I don t know, but I am. She was there and then she was gone. I felt it.
Incredible. We should take a drive before they re gone. Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Yep. There s some great places nearby.
What?
Huh.
Don t think so.
Nothing.
You don t have to do that.
Okay. Don t... you don t understand what this is.
I did NOT! I did not kill anyone. Jesus. Claire, listen to me. I walked in and she was lying there dead. I swear to you. On my life! She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me! To destroy us! If I hadn t stopped by here before school, the painters would have
Shhhh.
: No, I said, I hate what I m doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it s true.
: Well, they are.
Then what is he...?
You ve been shadowing the family for thirty years. It s only fitting you give one af us away.
Two what...?
But it doesn t make sense. They they used Lasher... they conspired with him.
With her family. Rowan s mother died yesterday.
There is a difference between sensing danger and being afraid. what defines you in the landscape, Michael...? what anchors your life...? Your work...? Your creativity...?
Michael, Rowan should
" Go back, Michael. Do what you can... "
Nothing was ever more false.
What are you talk
He made that quite clear, yes.
Mm hmm. Seems  lot longer.
Then you wear it.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
I m not saying I believe it... but I heard it nough times to know somebody did. They made a deal with the devil. Y know " make us rich " worship the number thirteen the whole bit. And some stuff about bringing them all back through a door... '
Hello...? Who is this...?
Rowan Mayfair. Who s calling...?
When did she die...?
Yes. Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate
I under5tand. All the same
I had you sent away.
It was quite warranted by the situation. I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan you never even knew her. It s not as if you ve suffered some great
A very tired one. I ve been up all night and I would. like to rest before the funeral. Have your lawyer
Out of the question Rowan, coming here will not change the
I want to see my mother. Where is she...?
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
I m tired. I need to rest.
Other properties as well here and in Europe. And vest holdings in sugar, oil, gold, electronics. Liquid funds over eighty million. tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
Better than most, I suppose.
She didn t feel them
Why are you doing this...? Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
It wes a dream...!
Stop it!
You re mad! Your mind is sick!
You are a murderer.
The door, Michael. find the key...
FAST.
I ll tell OR we re bringing
Lie...?
I 1ove you, Rowan. I ve always loved you. I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts so I could be as we are now.
Explain this to me violated...?
It is from love.
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose. And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
Go away! I don t want you here.
It s very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
I LOVE him!
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...... but Marguerite could not help me. Nor Julien...
I love Michael...
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
Wrong...? Science is not magic.
You went into the cells and you changed them. How...?!
I don t know what you are!!!
I m glad you re around to say it.
The one time I want it to work...
You re not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen starved brain and nobody
Rowan...
Like this...? LIKE THIS...?!
And whose houses do you design...?
Really...? Your family there...?
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
All I meant was
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
Let s see... Next you tell me all the terrible things about you and prove that we re doomed to fail right...? you hate kittens and puppies, you ve drivin all your lovers to suicide and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really
God knows, I m intriguing.

Michael! Jesus I ve been trying
Listen. Last night oh Christ, this 1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Wait a minute. Rowan what is going on...?
Michael I saw him! Twice! Carlotta said I killed Graham with with my anger.
Rowan... Think of what s in that book. Think of last night!
Yes. I love you. Very much.
Hello..
He can t hurt us, Michael. It s us our love. He can t find a crack in it. He can t find a way in.
I don t think of us that way ever.
That s GREAT!
Their what...?
Mm hmmm...
Did you see the old man on the
No. This is unreal...
That s cause we re below sea level.
Your beneficence.
A bit much. Lucas.
What were you talking about...?
Hi. You you wanna get some breakfast...? Maybe see a movie...?
That s not good enough. Why not...?!
Michael please just. a little longer. Don t leave.
Stop it!
Michael I m sorry... Just give me
Bullshit! Let me in! Mikey there are people who can help figure this ont.
You can t just
Left behind...? This about Rowan...?
Sut McKinley. Marry me.
You really love this guy...?
Hey I love gloves I look really great in gloves.
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Papers...?
No tax shelters. No funding. I want to fund the clinic exclusively. The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic. I d like to find an existing building and move in immediately while we draw up plans for new construction.
The one on the left definitely...
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
I m sorry I didn t think
CHIC MAGAZINE?
BRIAN...
Yes it is...
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
That s right...
No it s no problem I do it all the time
No not all the time I mean
Oh really you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
Sure...
I m sorry?
Yes I m sorry ELLEN...
I m a dentist
And how many people have you killed?
You don t know?
Where do you kill them...
My car I stopped working from my car. She could have stopped me you know If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast If a dog attacked you you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself Why then do people get bitten by dogs savaged? Why?
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts... Society is rotting men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft women are making them soft by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention so she doesn t deserve any more
No she didn t...
I don t want to talk about it
I don t know...
I don t know...
My wife My wife was the only one who really deserved it. LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it s your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do she mothered me...
I don t think so... This isn t a game you know... There aren t points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband but I am no killer.
Why should I?
STEPHANIE?
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don t get me wrong I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done I can t believe it is me... Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
There isn t that much you didn t even taste it What s wrong don t you like my tea?
Nothing LESLIE I just think we should wait...
I don t know it s your house ELLEN
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
I had an accident I fell down stairs...
No he had to he s just he s out...
What s this all about?
I m here about the so called disappearance of your husband It s best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean? I m working on the WHITE ANGEL case now and I ve got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you... So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
At home alone where were you?
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
I m good I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
I d really like it if you would come round some time Then I could cook you a meal what do you say...
Yes...?
Or was it, she wished he was dead that s it I believe he left the country with another woman all rather sordid.
No she isn t in any trouble is she?
You and your pep talks.
Were you always this sick?
That s crazy talk.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Cut it out, before you break something!
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
This isn t some 80 s porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
What is it now?
Dead?
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
It s a lot to digest. Imagine how you d feel.
Take a whiff of heaven.
I d call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different. She wasn t your mother mother
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
No, leave one. Somebody s grandmother might want one.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
We reinvented ourselves.
You ve obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
From your lips, to God s ears.
Ladies first. I insist.
Yeah?
Yeah?
You like me. I like you. I guess it s pretty obvious to everyone.
But that smile.
So that s a maybe?
Yeah? You like?
Christy? You want to be in " Heaven? "
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Do it?
Which you pulled, hard!
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
You have changed since second grade.
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn t a drop of blood in my brain.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
But that doesn t make you the boss of everything, son.
We miss you. We miss our son.
Dad, please.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn t have to slaughter your sow.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don t want to do. It s all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
Of course we are.
Well, why should I?
I guess.
Yeah.
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Like one of those " National Geographic " specials with the topless chicks?
I guess it s better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
Just say it, Dad.
Dad, let s just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
It s okay. You need me?
Watch your tone, mister.
I don t have much experience with a... uh... stick.
I don t even know if I should be doing this. It s a very expensive car.
Some of them have to be automatics.
I know. I m Ginger. Miss April.
That s me.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
What do you mean? I m Ted Nelson.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Hmmm?
What do you want me to do?
But if you re watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men s magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
You mean they knew who I was?
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded " Heaven, " they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren t happy with it.
I understand.
Well, Jay. They ve been exceptionally supportive.
I see, so you d be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
Most places are, Jimmy.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
Very funny.
My room?
It s not up to me.
You want it in writing?
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I m gone and I ll be doing hard time.
Aside from the fact that Mom s eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn t broken, things couldn t be better.
You can t come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
I meant biologically.
I didn t forget.
That s just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
Christy s a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
Me ow.
I have absolutely no intention
But you triple dog dared me.
Your article sucked.
In the sense that there is no " hidden agenda " behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
Come on, Julie. Don t screw up. You have some real talent.
I m trying to help.
Then I ll write about YOU.
" Local boy inherits more money than god. " Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
Is this an gritty expos  or a candy ass press release?
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I m Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
You re so twitterpated you don t even see the miner s hat and the pickax.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
He didn t. He had it built.
Not " whatever. " It s two different things.
He phoned it in.
I doubt it.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
Your dad taught you everything.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
It s incredibly simple.
Eventually you ll let go.
Then you ll see who s really holding on to you.
I know.
But you never do.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
There s gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
Well? Where the hell are you?
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
I m trembling with excitement.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Wearing them? Or humping them?
That s refreshingly deviant.
I m very aural.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
Not a chance.
Maybe someday.
That s hard to believe.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
You ve seen one naked breast, you ve seem them all.
You re quick. I like that.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I d do it and I have to keep my word.
I m not going anywhere, Ted. You re the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
Very ambitious. I like that.
Yellow pages?
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Did you have a nice flight? Are they taking good care of you?
Save it, honey. We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don t want you to run up Mr. Zukerman s phone bill.
What is all this? When are you coming home?
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
Only the best for my mother.
Oh. Goodness.
Like what?
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn t really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door... What are you selling?
People pay good money for that?
I m terrible at this. I blurt. I m a blurter. Your parents... They... well... they exist no further. Skinny dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn t pretty.
I m seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
Kelly Van Ryan...
Sam... I... Sandra Van Ryan s been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long. She s pushing for suspension...
That s great. I ll just tell my creditors I m not a rapist. No problem... Shit. I can t believe the board s going to act without even hearing my side of it.
Kelly.
And where might that be?
I love Antigua. Maybe I ll come visit you.
The teeth doin any talkin?
What about the blood?
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
She still work there?
And the child...
Suzie. Then you re not her grandmother...
I just want to get it over with. My mom s making me do this. I just want to forget it.
Take your time.
I understand.
Was there penetration? Did he put himself inside you?
That s okay, Kelly. You re doing fine. But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt. Was this the first time a man was inside you?
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold. '
He kept saying, " Let it happen, let it happen. " Then he just stopped.
Not at first. He was still inside but he wasn t moving or anything... He said we had this secret. And that now he d be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that. I don t know. It s hard to remember, exactly.
No.
She didn t cone home last night. We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
You re telling me you believe the guy?
The skinny brunette.
Maybe Lombardo s attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
Unless what?
Why? You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life. He s gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you re describing...
I flat don t like the guy, Glory. He s dirty. And I ll tell you something else. You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money? He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal. It was after the war. Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him. The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
You could say that.
Those are Suzie Toller s teeth.
Ray, you heard him...
And if the teeth aren t Suzie s? You ll give this up?
Where s Lombardo?
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie s.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
So you were alone.
Did he come in with you?
What was that?
Where s this coming from?
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
What about witnesses?
You heard Kelly say " Sam. " That was Lombardo on the phone. And you saw the girls...
Just tell us what happened.
You didn t cuff her?
Yeah... okay... he did
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody s gonna believe me anyway...
I m sorry... you said it hurt? Why?
I said he did.
What?
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
No. But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Yeah, but he can t push you around like he can me. You ve got family and they ve got clout. With we it s different... with me...
I m scared, that s what. I m scared there s no one to trust.
Oh, for Christ s sake.
Curiosity, I guess.
You re out of your mind.
Hi, Mon.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
I miss Dad.
No you don t.
I m here to congratulate my friends and their children. I m leaving again tonight.
Where, the mall?
Aren t you forgetting something? Your coupon. We gotta have it.
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She s trying to break my trust. How do you like that? I can t touch it until she s dead and she won t give me a dime and now she s trying to break it to pay you...
Do it to ourselves?
Yes.
Why can t you come...
You know what it takes.
Hello.
Duquette. Forget him...
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
And you believe her?
Kelly... Relax. Take one of your mom s valium or something. In another week you get on the plane. It s over. We re rich.
That s not your line.
I love you. Now give me the line.
You think that s wise?
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Lady has some deep pockets. That s all I m saying.
What s that supposed to mean?
Sound nice? It s a fucking drug rehab farm. It s where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp. Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there s no way they can put this thing in front of a jury. Shit, they haven t even taken your statement yet. Reason? They re still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they re coming up empty. Now tell me I m right.
Good. So what we re going to do is march right to Hunter s doorstep. We re going to insist they take a statement. We re going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back. They re walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
I was just thinking about where I m gonna stay. I lost the house. It s like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
Just like that?
Where she lives. In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
You can t...
Will they?
That s cop bullshit.
About what?
Is this supposed to mean something to me? What triangle?
I don t mean who you re thinking. I have other friends...
Don t you see what this means? You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money? You, the pill head with the rap sheet?
The one you bought at school.
In cutoffs, a wet T shirt.
And she wanted to talk.
But you can t tell us what she wanted to talk about.
And she began to cry. And you put an arm around her.
It is and I don t. Ordinarily... But, I mean... there s this kid standing in front of you crying...
Yes, we call it a winch. And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
Come on, man. I ll make a sailor out of you yet.
That how you planned it? You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Are you mad at me?
The guy was history when he killed Kelly. You knew that.
Yeah, real funny. You re wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
We?
Walter. He s been aimin that Brownie through knotholes for years. I saw these, I knew he d finally struck gold. I can t decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly s got up her nose, or that vibrator you ve got up her ass. What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
Hi, Sandy.
I ll bet. Look, Sam. Why don t you come by this weekend. We ll take the boat out...
What? Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Listen, Kelly skipped school. Have you talked to her?
Shit. Here we go again.
Jim West.
I don t mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Funny. So am I.
Your train? Listen, friend, you re obviously lost.... I ve got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Put them all together and what do we have?
Then why kidnap them? Why not just kill them?
Wait a minute. Now I know where I ve heard of you. You re the gadget guy.
You need that real often?
No offense, but all I ever need... Are these... And this.
All right, if it ll make you happy, I ll try that.
Aha?
Is this leading somewhere?
Starting with a screw?
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Prepare what?
Call me that again, and you re going to find a boot where it doesn t belong.
Quite. Come, let s mingle.
Whoa, Jim. Maybe. But we can t arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
Almost?
You re either having a seizure or you just said " hello. "
All what?
At least the thing s not that fast. We just follow it. Whenever it stops, we re there, waiting.
No, I m not all right. They got away. And we can t even follow them. They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
What way is that?
" Spontaneous. " I like that. Most people say something like " hare brained reckless son of a bitch. "
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Sure. We have no idea what s going on.
Come on, let s at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Sure. It s a wind up... thing.
It s better than nothing.
Sounds like a train. Looks like a train.
It s not a guy...
Relax. We re almost there.
This? I m testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
Oh, thank you.
What? President Grant is...!
I don t have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
I d love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
He was going to shoot me! Do you mind?!
What is this? A whole new train?
Yes, me!
Here. Mr. Tyler. He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
They don t even realize they should be frightened.
I get that feeling. You know, Mr. Tyler, I m the kind of woman who doesn t believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I m tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
Really?
Your guests, ma am?
Well, I owe you one, don t I?
You tell me.
Forgive me, but you don t strike me as the social secretary type.
Would that include me?
You bring the best out in a man.
Private train?
Of course, sir, that s why I ve assigned a new man. And he s no ordinary Marshal. He s quite sophisticated. Three college degrees. A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Yes sir.
This is Colonel Richards.
Nicely said, sir.
And?
No, sir... just a businessman.
He had a pressing engagement.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy eight of my loyal followers? You are in my domain!
That would be... the Mexican War?
" Emperor Miguelito...? "
Well, your highness, what makes you think we ll ever sign a treaty with you?
Who were they? What do they want with me?
Who was this partner of his?
They re coming.
They re rounding up a posse. Figure an hour?
You re not going to use it, are you?
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
No!
No.
That s all I ever wanted!
What do I need for that?
Till it s in a powder. The energy exits within you...
I must concetrate my imagination... to creat a new... reality!
I can t remember all these things. What am I learning?
His will.
Why?
No! I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Who is he?
I know she s hungry. I tried to feed her but she wouldn t eat a thing. I m not a wet nurse.
Queen Cherlindrea?
Who??
Take your time. Don t worry about the elves. They won t come out here.
Maybe milking.
Cows. You know, cows?
Guess I m not used to so much.
Upstairs, asleep. Where d you think?
That s none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier than thou mouth shut! Anyway, they like Fred.
John, I don t understand any of this.
John, why?...
No pistol. Ever.
... I want to say a thing.
It s them, Sam. Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
Oh, he s good.
Yeah.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
Maybe.
Maybe.
If there isn t I ve just wasted the last six months.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I ll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they ll blow the whole thing.
Tell you what... why don t you and that blonde  what s her name  come over for dinner Sunday. How bout that.
I hope you don t have any doubts about that.
Who else knows?
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
Johnny 
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You re out there all alone... We re getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
Samuel. Samuel Lapp. But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
We re looking for a suspect. We ve reason to believe he s still in the area.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
Doesn t surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
We do not go into your courts.
No you re not  You re glad, because now you ve got a witness. I heard the other police talking last night. They don t seem to like you very much.
No.
Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close. Look, it s narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They ll do anything. And they can get away with it because they re cops.
Home.
I can t.
No, no doctor...
Gunshot... they ll file reports... they ll find me.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Only the elders.
What?
Two days.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun
Very interesting. I m learning a lot about manure. What s that?
Something wrong with buttons?
Hochmut?
Anything against zippers?
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They re Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
I m going this morning.
I know what he said.
Oh? What happened to Hochstetler?
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
I can whack people. I m hell at whacking.
Now hold on. There s a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
But... You may not be well enough.
There was.
I know.
No. I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
Aren t you? After today?
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
Land! Are you crazy? I m no Amishman and I m no farmer! I m a cop. That s what I know and that s what I do!
That s your way, not mine.
Where s my baggy pants?
I didn t even know about it.
Let s just find Coalmine. Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn t let anybody down. It happens 
What the hell are you talking about? What s happening.
Johnny, what the fuck?
I hear you.
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Too hot. Don t do it. Don t come in.
I hear you. I ll stay in touch.
Say again?
Wrong.
I admit I don t know where he is.
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that s a goddamn lie!
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
I don t know where he is.
Yes, thank you very much.
Yes.
You didn t have to...
You re not carrying a bullwhip... how d you manage to put my kids to work?
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
At home you d never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
You just wouldn t. It s not the Amish way. But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
No...
We ll pray that he doesn t die! But if he does, then we ll find a way so no one knows!
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
I have committed no sin.
That is idle talk.
You are acting like one!
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
He s from... Ohio... My cousin.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
Tight. But I m working on him.
Lady, I m here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal. He s got a gun, hasn t he?
You might have killed him!
My son is out there!
They are English. They don t understand.
Fifty seven, fifty eight
Dorothy, please! We re trying to count! Fifty eight
Oh, but he doesn t do it every day just once or twice a week. And he can t catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she s gonna get the sheriff, and
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Dorothy. Dorothy, dear. It s Aunt Em, darling.
There, there, lie quiet now. You just had a bad dream.
Here, here, what s all this jabber wapping when there s work to be done? I know three shiftless farm hands that ll be out of a job before they know it!
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
But we ve got to verify it legally To see...
If she...
If any!
I don t believe you!
Ohhh!
I can t come back! I don t know how it works!
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
This?
Oh!
Hickory!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
All in good time, my little pretty all in good time.
Certainly certainly when you give me those slippers.
I m sorry. I didn t do it! Can I still have my dog?
Who, me? Why, I m not a witch at all. I m Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Oh. But, if you please what are Munchkins?
Oh, I d give anything to get out of Oz altogether but which is the way back to Kansas? I can t go the way I came.
The Wizard of Oz? Is he good or is he wicked?
No, I m afraid I didn t.
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
You don t need to be helped any longer. You ve always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Toto, too.
Whenever you wish.
How did you guess?
Why
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn t even miss me.
No, they won t honestly.
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can t we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Yes... That s Aunt Em.
Well, I I can t quite see. Why, she s crying.
Someone has hurt her someone has just about broken her heart.
Uh huh.
Oh, no no!
But what s this? I thought you were going along with me.
Did you say something?
... Oh, did that hurt?
Oh, goodness! How did you ever get like this?
Well, you re perfect now.
I m afraid I m a little rusty yet.
Oh, but he will! He must! We ve come such a long way already.
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh, dear. I don t know what I d do if a whole swarm kept Oh! Oh! Oh, there s one on me!
Oh, see I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
What sort of an animal is that?
Well, you didn t have to go and hit me, did you? Is my nose bleeding?
Oh.
Why, I d thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Oh, well, then we ll ask him for you.
But why? Why?
Oh, come on.
No, but it s wonderful for threatening with.
Are you gonna stand around And let em fill us full of horror?
Did they hurtcha?
Stay with us, then, Dorothy. We all love you. We don t want you to go.
I have so got brains.
Oh, Hunk, you just won t listen, that s all.
Oh, well, here let me help you.
Ohhhh
Oh does it hurt you?
Ohhh
Oh! Oh! Ohhh!
They would?
Where s Kansas?
You re going to see a Wizard?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Yes that s true.
Witch? Huh! I m not afraid of a witch! I m not afraid of anything except a lighted match.
Oh well you re not starting out very well.
To Oz?
What?
Here here
Of course, I don t know, but I think it ll get darker before it gets lighter.
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Ohh! OHH! OHH!
Leave her alone!
Oh, rubbish! You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
Ah
Who at?
Somebody pulled my tail.
I Oh
Fine. He s got a plan
Yeah. Me?
I I I I gotta get her outta there?
Here here. Go way and let us alone!
Why don t you try counting sheep?
It s a whatzis?
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
We do.
Look you can see it here. It s wonderful!
I don t think I could, but we could try.
Yes.
It s the Wicked Witch! What ll we do? Help! HELP!
Oh look out.
Oh! Well, what happened to you?
Now, now, don t fret.
Oh
You put up a great fight, Lion.
It makes you nervous?
Well, I
Well, I
But I still want one.
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Couldn  t make it. Splitting headache.
So who are you?
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
Then it  s no longer a bomb?
I did kill us. She thinks we  re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
It  s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack. The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Elektra King.
Makes her look even more innocent.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor. He  s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub  s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
But what if...
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He  s a man of great integrity.
It  s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle. Largest landlocked body of water on Earth. Oil rich. Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
I took the initiative.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Who?
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
 That which does not kill me makes me stronger. 
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
The inside man?
Who did you get it from?
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
It  s I who should thank you for taking that money back to MI 6. So distressing for M. An explosion inside her lair.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
I  m sorry.
Yes.
Funerals aren  t exactly memorable.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. He  s decisive, vigilant. And he makes an excellent omelette.
It  s not the pin your father wore. It  s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
That  s every man within a five mile radius. Including you. That  s why you  re here, isn  t it? You think I can  t do it. You think I  m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
I have to go.
No. You  ll be safe here.
A little. Does it matter? After all, what  s the point of living if you can  t feel alive? Isn  t that right, Elektra? Isn  t that your motto?
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
You can drop the act, it  s over.
He used your exact words.
You turned Renard.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Bond, I  m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family  s, now it  s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state of the art Russian Army weapons?
Where did you get this?
How high up does this... arms dealing go?
She  s no innocent. This is my nuclear consultant.
What  s your business with Elektra King?
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House your House. And you didn  t even bat an eyelid. She was paying you off. What for?
A rope!
And the payoff on the tables?
No! Get me out!
Where?
How appropriate.
What class sub does your nephew run?
Your father...
Someone will come.
Anywhere in this circle. Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
It  s heading for the oil terminal.
Laurie, I ll have to ask you to come with me.
I can t tell you that. It is quite urgent.
What?!
What about the aftermath? This so called... " nuclear winter " theory?
You oughta see upstairs. It s a slaughterhouse.
Washington?
Don t call me that.
Wrong answers?
God isn t there to do it.
My God. Murdered? What s this have to do with Rorschach?
You know how he is. He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs then he s satisfied. It blows over.
If he comes here, I ll handle him. Remember I ve always protected you. Haven t I? Do you need money?
You did the right thing, Daniel. Let s stay in touch, okay? Good night.
I don t know, but... in the wake of all that s happened, I m starting to think Rorschach may have been right. Is Laurie okay?
Good. Be careful, Daniel, don t let up your guard. Look, I m going to head south for a while hole up at Karnak until all this blows over. You two would be welcome to join me.
The missing scientists.
Good Lord. How d you get it on tape?
What is it? How does it work?
Adrian you ve lost it.
And what if you  re wrong?
What if you  re wrong??
You ruthless son of a bitch. You really believe this mad scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Dan, are you really that paranoid? Let s face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Now wait. We all had the same option as Blake. It was work for the government or do time.
Damn straight! We were heroes.
Well, that was Adrian s idea. I know he s the smartest man in the world and all that, but talk about publicity hounds...
Oh yeah. The one that used to confess to everything? Hoping we d beat him up?
Oh, yeah. They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out. No expense account. No place to live.
Maybe not, but why take chances?
No, screw that. What you were saying before, it s absolutely right. I d love to have you stay.
His... whatever.
I d say you stalled out about forty years ago. Nellie Lutcher Louis Jordan I ve never even heard of these people.
Sure. It works. I mean, look at this face, Daniel. I m thirty eight years old!
I like the way you look. It s strange with Jon. He doesn t age. His face doesn t change. But you, Daniel, you look...
Not at all. You look very dashing. Here, you pick one.
I know what you re thinking. You d be a lot safer if I weren t around.
I m an open target, Dan. If you re with me
Antarctica??
Would you want to sit out a war? I mean what would be left.
What are you up to?
It s a peace rally. The CTU s just opened fire on the crowd.
I don t want to take em out. Just want to keep em interested.
Yes you are.
That s because
Long as we re on the subject of perverts... I miss Rorschach. Let s spring him.
I think he s going to the john.
Those cars. What year is this??
Wherever we are, it s better than what we left. Backs together
Veidt s a fool. Tried to warn him about new information. Sicced his mangy cat on me.
What do you mean, frame up?
Veidt s assassin. Leads to follow. Can t just
Coward. Giving up.
The guidance system s fried. I had to switch to manual. Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
He s the one. He s been the one all along. Stalking us.
Jon Osterman, you don t act like a Princeton boy. What s a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
We should get back What?
What?
Thanks, no. But it s a wonderful product. Now Adrian your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
Did you know he was back on the streets?
I don t know their real names.
I don t know their real names!
What does this mean? What does it
Am I free to go?
I don t know why you ve been keeping me here, but you re in deep shit
Jon?? You mean he s
And how s life with the walking H bomb?
I ll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Stay, Adrian. I just every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human. He doesn t think like we do. He doesn t even feel what we feel. I mean he even scares the research teams.
I know. I shouldn t be saying this. He s happy, he s content, he s doing his work
Maybe I ll do that.
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a. k. a. Moloch.
Worked both sides of the fence. Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Ever see one of these before?
Yeah, I ve heard all about your conspiracy theories. Now I ve got a roomful of cameras in there. I want you out. Now. And whatever you re doing, knock it off. You re making us all look bad.
The name s Gibbons. You were saying?
Looks like a diner.
That shows me already that you don t have a clue. What s it to you, anyway?
Good for you. Now why don t you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn t go through all this for my benefit.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you re gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
.. If you re trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Are we done now? You ve got nothing on me. So if you ain t booking me, I m walking.
Is that a fact?
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they re God.
You re a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You re not interested in my past, you re interested in my future as some kind of spy.
I m not interested. I ve already got a job.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
There s some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I m able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
Wherever you go on the planet, I ll find you. There s no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
If you re trying to push my buttons, you re on the right track. Don t make me question my own judgment, X.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
We re not after car thieves here.
That information is classified. You re there to gather information on their operations, period.
My friend, if you re planning on crossing me...
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here s what I m thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it s swimming up the Potomac.
Hey, one miracle at a time. They re on to me now, remember?
You re a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
I m on the way with a team to relieve you. What s the latest?
Yes it does.
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it ll kill everything in the vicinity.
Yeah, that s right. So now that you know, you understand why it s important that we get it back.
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You ve done your job, X, head back to Prague. I ll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
I m pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
Oh yeah? Why don t we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
Oh, I don t know. It was an accident.
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They re called " Anarchy 99 ", they re the bad guy bosses.
" Anarchy " 99 "?
What do you get if you finish?
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
Yorgi asked me to.
Go to hell.
Mind your business.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
Don t even bother, X man, I m not your type.
We hung out last night, remember?
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you re not what you say you are.
The eyes don t lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn t it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi s girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don t like it so much, but you re in so deep you can t get out anymore. Tell me if I m wrong, Petra.
I m from L. A.
Let s just say I m freelancing and leave it at that.
Don t judge a comic book by it s cover.
I know where he s coming from. The only thing I really don t get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They re interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There s a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
What are you talking about?
It s a long story, but yeah, more or less.
If I go out the back, he ll know you ve warned me.
No, something worse. He says it s a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
There s something I didn t have time to tell you before.
I m a agent as well. KGB. I ve been undercover for over a year.
I don t know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I m in so far, they d kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I m like you said, a criminal.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
When can I see you again?
What the hell are you doing? You could ve killed me!
We re getting out of this place. We ve done enough.
It doesn t matter anymore, forget it.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
No, now it s about us. Let s do something for us before we both get killed. Don t you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
We ll have to go after them.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that s my problem. If you don t feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can t imagine.
You don t have to do that.
Aren t they gonna wonder were you ve been?
When this is over, we re just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
You can t talk to it?
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
I d forgotten how exciting it is working together.
Why don t we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown nose the right people.
Why don t you show me some gear before you get hurt.
It s a stakeout suit. It s got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It s all weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
I m through, Xander.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It s insane, I can t take it anymore.
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won t take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you ve got too much " integrity " for that.
Alright, so I ll get more.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
Of course I m serious. I bought it, didn t I?
I don t know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
You re not exactly " going anywhere " yourself.
Here we go again.
What s the deal?
Why you dogging me up?
This pizda? Never seen him before.
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
Sorry, man, don t know what you re talking about.
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
What s " Anarchy 99 "?
"... try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese ". Anarchy Burger by the Vandals.
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
It s a beautiful town, Prague. It s been good to me.
You, an Army brat? I don t see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
Connections and politics, it s the same everywhere.
That s alright, I m kinda tired.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
You think I m after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
Easier than that, buddy. I ll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone s involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
Sure, if that s what you want. Why not? It s all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
We all do.
For what purpose?
I don t like him being here.
You saw what happened tonight. You think Magneto won t come after him again. You think he won t come here if necessary. This is a school, for God s sake.
Well, I think that s perfectly understandable.
What s that?
Into the Hudson?
It s too far.
You know, you
Some cigars. Case of beer.
I won t light the cigars how about that?
Yeah? Well I don t like to talk about my past.
By reading my thoughts?
Were you now?
He takes his work seriously.
I ve seen a lot of rings.
Math. History. Science. English. Athletics
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet. Perhaps even your children, Senator.
Treat you like a mutant? We are not what you think. Not all of us.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
What do you want?
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
No. That s me talking. And you know what? It s only been thirty two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
To find Rogue.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
They re all asking how you re doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
The sun is setting, Logan. You ve been asleep for nineteen hours.
She borrowed your power to save her life. When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths their gifts. In your case your ability to heal. That s why she keeps her body covered.
If she held on any longer she could have.
And I ll never understand terrorists.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind. Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves definitively.
The way what is going to be?
It does indeed, Max.
From your office, sir.
Yes, sir. But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir. Do you want the other cauliflower?
Baack!
MMMmmmm.
Is it that music?
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
Hello...?
Well... yes.
Of course.
Yes.
Yes, don t worry.
Yes.
I promise.
Very.... very!
Oh, nice.
Whatever makes you happy.
You re incorrigible!
Surprised!
Yes. I am a bit tired, after all.
Yes, he s a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
No, of course not. I just meant...
But you can t do that at night. And even if you could it would cost a fortune. Come to bed, darling.
You ve done everything that s humanly possible, Frederick. Oh, darling, I m so worried about you you need rest.
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding?... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Is it worth taking a chance?
Fron kon steen!
No, it s pronounced Fron kon steen.
No, Fred ereck.
It s not. It s Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
I m sure we will.
I beg your pardon?
Why are you talking like that?
What wockers?
Wockers with the knockers???
Fro derick!
Just putting up some tea.
What?
What?
What?
' How I Did It. Good title!
Could be worse!
Yes. Dr. H. Delbruck.
Was he any good?
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
He only died two weeks ago I m sure they ll still have him. Hurry now. I ll prepare the body.
Why?
If you like just hurry!
Yes! It s all written down in the notes. Tie off the kites and come down!
Tonight?
What?
What?
Who are you talking to?
I didn t make a yummy sound I just asked what it was.
Don t fall for that one.
You can say that again.
You re just supposed to repeat what you said.
... I m glad that s...
Ayegor! Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
What did you find out?
How do you know it was a he?
How do you know it was a she?
Can you play it?
What???
That sound good, boss.
I like your style, master. How do we get him here?
Is everything ready?
It s the only way.
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
MMMmmmmmmmm.
MMMmmmm! MMMmmmm!
Diff rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
That s quite all right. What is it, dear?
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
Well...
No, thanks! I want to get right to sleep.
Yes, you may... but don t make any noise.
What is it? Is something wrong, Doctor?
Yes! What could it be at this hour?
Whatever it is, it s coming from down there. I m going down to see.
Well, this explains the music.
And look at this, Doctor!
Oh, Frederick... you re not only a great doctor, you re a great... you re almost a...
Yes!
Raise the platform, hurry!
I thought it was wonderful.
I think you ve done it, master.
Me? Sing?
This is not the finals just sing!
Are you serious??
I think so.
What s wrong, Doctor? You seem... lonely.
Not fooling around.
I see what you mean.
I say, it wouldn t be fair to you... or to me.
No. Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
Why don t we talk inside?
It wouldn t be fair to her.
You ve got to help me to remain faithful.
MMMMmmmmm!
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
His schwanzstucker.
You can t expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Four
